      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record in this matter that on the 29th of August, 1900, during the progress of a trial then being held before the Court of First Instance at Bacolor, in the Province of Pampanga, the court had occasion to caution Angel Alberto, a witness in the case, not to look at the attorney for the defendant but to fix his attention on the judge who was at the time examining him. It seems that the witness did not give heed to this warning, and the judge thereupon arose from his seat and approaching the witness, seized him by the shoulders, and using the expression,  \"Lingon ang mucha\" (\"Look at me\"), either shook him, as insisted by the attorney for the defendant, or only turned him about, as claimed by the judge and others. Whether the witness was shaken or only turned about, at all events  \"seizing him,\" brought the defendant’s attorney to his feet, who, protesting against the action of the judge as coercive of the witness, demanded that a record be made of the occurrence and that the further hearing of the case be postponed. Two days afterward the clerk entered in his record a recital of the incident substantially as above, and also a statement that on other and prior occasions the attorney, Marcelino Aguas, had been wanting in respect to the court by making use of  \"improper phrases,\" and by interrupting opposing counsel in their examination of witnesses. The court on this record adjudged the attorney to be in contempt of court and suspended him from the practice of his profession for a period of twenty days. The attorney appealed, but his appeal having been disallowed by the lower court, he asked to be heard in justification, which was granted. <br/><br/>On the hearing in justification evidence was taken touching the contempt alleged to have been committed by Señor Aguas, from which the court found that during the trial of the case of Roberto Toledo v. Valeriano Balatbat, the judge, having had occasion to seize the witness, Alberto Angel, by the shoulders to turn him around, Señor Aguas, attorney for defendant, had risen from his seat in a  \"menacing attitude,\" and  \"with a voice and body trembling\" protested that the action of the judge was coercive of the witness; and further that his attention being called to the fact that he was wanting in respect to the court and that he should sit down, he waived his right to go on with the trial and moved a postponement of the hearing. On this finding the court again adjudged the attorney guilty of contempt of court, and suspended him from the practice of his profession for a period of twenty days. From this judgment Señor Aguas appealed to this court. <br/><br/>In our opinion the action of the judge in seizing the witness, Alberto Angel, by the shoulder and turning him about was unwarranted and an interference with that freedom from unlawful personal violence to which every witness is entitled while giving testimony in a court of justice. Against such conduct the appellant had the right to protest and to demand that the incident be made a matter of record. That he did so was not contempt, providing protest and demand were respectfully made and with due regard for the dignity of the court. The only question, therefore in this case is, Was the appellant respectful and regardful of the court’s dignity in presenting his objection and asking that it be recorded in the proceedings? The witnesses say and the judge finds that  \"his attitude was menacing\" (bastante amenazadora) in the moment of making his protest, but beyond that there is nothing in the record which even tends to show that he was disrespectful to the court or unmindful of its dignity. In our opinion both testimony and finding state a mere conclusion which, in the absence of the facts from which it was deduced, is wholly valueless to support a judgment of contempt. The statement that the attorney’s attitude was  \"menacing\" tended no more to competently establish the alleged offense of contempt than if the witnesses had testified and the court had found that his conduct was  \"contemptuous or lacking in respect.\" The specific act from which it was inferred that his attitude was menacing should have been testified to by the witnesses and found by the court, and failing that, the record does not show concrete facts sufficient to justify the conclusion that he was disrespectful to the court or offensive to its dignity. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed from must therefore be reversed, and it is so ordered, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Torres and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Intramuros (Manila) in an action for an accounting instituted by Walter Jackson against Paul Blum, H. Blum, W. A. Whaley, and L. M. Johnson. The matter involved is a leasehold interest in the business property known as the  \"Alhambra,\" situated on the Escolta in Manila, together with the furniture and fixtures and other appurtenances. <br/><br/>In August, 1898, Señor Roca took a lease from the owner of the Alhambra and a short time afterwards transferred the same to Evans, Jackson, and Williams. Williams conveyed his interest to Evans and Jackson and the establishment was conducted by Evans &amp; Jackson. The firm of Evans &amp; Jackson in the property was transferred to Evans. In this transfer it was agreed that when the establishment was free from all incumbrances there should be a settlement between Jackson and Evans, and that Jackson should remain the owner of his interest in the property. On the same day Evans, being then the apparent sole owner of the establishment, obtained a loan from Paul Blum in the sum of 32,443 pesos, and in carrying out the transaction a partnership was formed between Evans and Whaley, and a conveyance, absolute in form, was then made by Evans &amp; Whaley to Paul Blum, transferring to him the establishment, and a contract was also entered into between Evans and Whaley on the one part and Paul Blum on the other part, in which agreement it was recited that Evans &amp; Whaley had borrowed from Paul Blum the said sum of 32,443 pesos and that they had executed to Blum the conveyance of the establishment mentioned. It was stipulated that Whaley was to be the managing partner of the firm of Evans &amp; Whaley, Evans having the right to enter the premises at any time and to inspect the books of account. Each was to receive out of the business for his personal expenses the sum of 300 pesos per month. It was also agreed by Evans &amp; Whaley to purchase from the American Commercial Company, of which Paul Blum was then a member, all supplies which they needed for the establishment. The loan made by Paul Blum to Evans &amp; Whaley was to be paid off from the net proceeds of each day’s business, which were to be deposited with the American Commercial Company to the credit of the Alhambra account, or to be paid from any other funds, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, and Evans &amp; Whaley had the right to pay the whole or any part of the debt at any time to Blum and from funds other than the profits of the Alhambra. Whaley was mentioned in the instrument as representative of Blum. It does not appear, however, from the instrument that Blum was to be considered a partner or in any way interested in the business. Blum perhaps required that Whaley should become the managing partner of the firm of Evans &amp; Whaley for the protection of his interests in advancing the money to them. No term for the duration of the partnership between Evans and Whaley was fixed, nor can any particular term be inferred from the nature of the business to be carried on by them. On the 13th day of November, 1899, a partnership settlement of the firm of Evans &amp; Jackson was made between Evans and Jackson and the balance of $5,000 was found to be due from Evans to Jackson, and an agreement was then entered into between Evans and Jackson in which it was recited that the sum of 20,000 pesos was the estimated amount due on the mortgage of the property to Blum and that the equity of redemption was of the value of 40,000 pesos, which belonged to each of the partners in equal parts. In payment of the balance of 5,000 pesos due Jackson on the settlement of accounts, and in consideration of the sum of 5,000 pesos, Evans transferred all of his interest in the Alhambra property to Jackson. On the following day Evans applied to Blum to ascertain the amount due him on the mortgage, offering to pay the same. Blum refused to recognize Jackson as having any rights in the establishment. Afterwards Blum demanded of Evans &amp; Whaley the payment of the sum of 28,000 pesos as due upon the mortgage, and Whaley, being then in exclusive possession of the property, turned over the same to Blum. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance was in favor of the plaintiff and an accounting was decreed. The contention of the defendant is: First, that by the sale from Evans and Whaley to Blum the property passed absolutely to Blum; second, that Evans could not substitute Jackson as debtor to blum without the consent of the latter; third, that the partnership between Evans and Whaley was based upon confidence, and that Jackson could not be substituted as a member of the firm; fourth, that the juridical relation does not exist between the plaintiff Jackson and the defendants. <br/><br/>We shall briefly state the law applicable to the facts in the case: A partnership may be terminated by the will or renunciation of one of the partners, provided no term has been fixed for its duration or when a term is not fixed by the nature of the business. (Arts. 1700 and 1795 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>Personal or real property which each partner possesses at the time of the execution of the contract continues to be his private property, the usufruct only passing to the partnership. (Art. 1675 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>Each coowner has the absolute ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits belonging thereto, and he therefore may sell, assign, or mortgage the same or substitute another in its enjoyment unless personal rights are involved. The effect of the sale or mortgage, however, so far as affects the coowners, shall be limited to that portion which may be allotted to him in the distribution at the termination of the community. (Art. 399 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>No co-owner is obliged to remain in the community. (Art. 400 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed with costs on appeal taxed to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance, Intramuros (Manila), by the plaintiff, Cordoba, to recover from the defendants, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., the sum of $479.57, Mexican currency, the value of certain merchandise alleged to have been short delivered by them as common carriers of the plaintiff, with 50 per cent of such value added as liquidated damages and also the costs of suit. In the court below judgment went for the defendants and plaintiff appealed. <br/><br/>The record discloses without contradiction that some time prior to June, 1900, the firms of Cahn, Nickelsberg &amp; Co. and Trieste &amp; Co. delivered at San Francisco, California, to the Pacific Main Steamship Company on board its steamship Rio de Janeiro, for shipment to Manila via Hongkong, twenty cases of shoes and five cases of hats, respectively, freight prepaid as per  \"accountable receipt\" or  \"way-bill.\" The goods were consigned to plaintiff, Manila, and properly marked with his name. On arrival at Hongkong they were delivered by the Pacific Mail to the steamer Diamante in good condition, for transshipment to Manila Bay, at which place the vessel arrived June 11, 1900, under consignment to the defendants. Ten days later the five cases of hats and six of the twenty cases of shoes were discharged into the lighters of Carman &amp; Co., agents of the plaintiff, empowered to receive and transport them from the ship’s side to the custom-house. <br/><br/>The court finds as a fact and the managing agent of the defendants positively testifies that before receiving the consignment of plaintiff, Carman &amp; Co. called the attention of the defendants to the condition of the cases, and then and there protested their receipt on account of their  \"bad condition.\" Nevertheless, the carrier, without verifying the contents of the packages and without demanding an examination of them on board, voluntarily delivered them to the lighter men who, under customs supervision and control, brought them to the custom-house, where they were deposited in the bodega set apart for broken packages. <br/><br/>On the 25th and 27th of June, 1900, and while the goods were still in the custom-house, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants, notifying them that the five cases of hats and the six cases of shoes bore evidence of having been tampered with, and asking that they name a representative to be present at the customs examination of the cases in order to note any shortage which might be disclosed thereby. Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. named Señor Abreu as their representative for the purpose, and he, conjointly with the customs officials, examined the cases in bad condition and reported to his principals that the packages were short 119 hats and 9 pairs of shoes. The merchandise found in the cases was received by the plaintiff from the custom-house some time subsequent to the 29th of June, 1900, on which date the duties were paid. Notwithstanding the report of their representative, the defendants declined to settle the claim presented for the missing goods, first, because the protested packages were not opened and examined before they left the ship’s side as required by the bill of lading, and second, because the claim of loss was not presented within twenty-four hours after delivery of the goods to the lighter for transportation to the custom-house. Both contentions of defendants were sustained by the court below in the suit which was subsequently commenced against them, and plaintiff appealed. <br/><br/>In our opinion neither one nor the other of the defenses set up by the consignees of the vessel was well founded. The bill of lading which provides that  \"in the event of any packages being refused on account of condition, they are, if in bad order, to be examined on board the steamer and contents certified to, when steamer’s responsibility will cease,\" gave to the defendants the undoubted right to retain on board and to examine all refused packages. This right, however, being exclusively for their own protection, they could waive it and they did waive it by discharging the goods, notwithstanding the protest, and accepting a receipt which specified on its face that the cases were in  \"bad condition\" when delivered for transportation to the custom-house. It lay wholly with the carrier to say whether the goods should or should not be discharged from the vessel without examination, and having voluntarily elected to so discharge them the respondents can not now be permitted to urge that the failure to examine the cases on board was a bar to the claim of <em>Appellant</em>. If the goods had been examined on board the failure of the consignees to give the certificate of shortage prescribed by the bill of lading would have constituted no defense to the action, and on the same principle their failure to retain and examine the packages after protest made can not be held to prejudice the rights of the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Respondents claimed on the hearing of this appeal that the duplicate receipt offered in evidence by the appellants could not be accepted as evidence, for the reason that on its face it appeared to have been written in different inks and by different persons. If the duplicate receipt was fictitious or manufactured for the occasion it could have been shown in a moment by the production of the original delivered to the carrier when the goods were discharged, and the failure to do so by defendants must be considered against them and as fatal to their contention. <br/><br/>Defendants’ second defense — that plaintiff’s suit must fail because his claim was not presented to the carrier or consignees of the vessel within twenty-four hours after receipt of the goods — can not be sustained for the reason that plaintiff’s claim was presented not later than the 27th of June, 1900, and he did not receive his consignment within the meaning of article 366 of the Commercial Code before the 29th of the same month. The discharge of the merchandise into the lighters of Carman &amp; Co. for delivery at the custom-house under customs supervision and control was not  \"the receipt of the merchandise\" contemplated by article 366. The packages were then in the hands of the Government, and their owner could exercise no dominion whatever over them until the duties were paid or secured to be paid. The time prescribed by article 366 within which claims must be presented does not begin to run until the consignee has received such possession of the merchandise that he may exercise over it the ordinary control pertinent to ownership. For these reasons the judgment of the court below must be reversed without special finding of costs, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It has been plainly proven that at the time this declarative action was initiated the defendant resided at Manila, P. I. He left Iloilo with his family November 19, 1898, and his family has never since returned to Iloilo. The defendant was at this latter place from February 17, 1899, until March 16 of the same year with the object, as alleged by him, of recovering the possession of his printing machine, which the American authorities refused to deliver. With this exception the defendant and family have resided permanently at Manila since they left Iloilo in November, 1898. <br/><br/>On April 1, 1899, a registration certificate was issued to him as a resident citizen of Manila. On January 1, 1900, his name was registered in the books of the Internal-Revenue Collector as a resident of Manila. On April 11, 1900, he presented a declaration to the Spanish consulate under article 9 of the treaty of Paris, in which he also stated that he was a resident of Manila. The plaintiff alleges in his complaint that the defendant is a resident of Manila; he also affirms this in his petition of November 20, 1900. It appears from the foregoing facts that it was the deliberate intention of the defendant to change the place of his residence. <br/><br/>No law has been cited, in force of this Islands, which requires citizens to announce their intention of changing their residence in a more public manner. <br/><br/>It is expressly alleged in the complaint that the original lease expired on the 1st of April, 1899. The right alleged by the plaintiff in his complaint is based exclusively upon two facts. The first is, that after the aforesaid lease had expired and after all rent due thereunder had been paid according to the terms thereof, the printing machine, the property of the defendant, still remained in the basement of the house, which basement was only a part of the house described in the original contract of lease. The plaintiff in hid complaint admits that the upper floor of his house was in use by him at the time he presented the complaint. The second is that a letter was written to the defendant May 17, 1899, advising him that the rent of the premises would be 150 pesos until the time the printing machine was removed from the building. The defendant did not answer this letter, but receipted for it at the post-office, as the letter was registered. <br/><br/>This action has been instituted with the object of collecting rent at the rate of 150 pesos per month from May 1, 1899, to the same month in 1900. The only question arising is this; Should this case be decided at Iloilo, where it originated, or at Manila? If there was a contract in this case it related only to the ground floor of the building and arises from the presence of the printing machine therein and from the letter of the plaintiff dated May 17, 1899. It was not stipulated in this letter where the payment should be made. In accordance with article 1574 of the Civil Code, article 1171 of the same Code is applicable, and the place of residence of the debtor is the place of payment. This personal action is, as affirmed by the plaintiff himself in his complaint, entirely distinct from and independent of an action of forcible entry and detainer. The rules which regulate the jurisdiction in such actions are not applicable to this case, which is governed by article 46, rule l, of the Law of Civil Procedure now in force. <br/><br/>The order appealed from the Court of First Instance of Iloilo is in accordance with law and must be affirmed with the costs against the <em>Appellant</em>. It so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the morning of May 27 of the current year Vicente Taguibao, Francisco Bancut, and Pedro Bancut went to a place called  \"Buquid\", in the town of Iguid. Taguibao, upon seeing Matias Paguiam engaged in plowing a piece of land which was the subject-matter of a dispute between Pedro Bancut and Vicente Gamat, immediately attacked Paguiam, inflicting blows upon his neck with the back of the bolo. The weapon used was shown by competent testimony to be of a class which it was permissible to carry. As a result of these blows Paguiam, who defended himself with his hands, received two slight wounds, before the combatants were separated by the bystanders, who subsequently testified in the case. <br/><br/>The facts stated do not constitute the crime of frustrated homicide, as they have been classified by the court below in the judgment under review, but merely a misdemeanor against the person, prohibited and penalized in article 589, No. 1, of the Penal Code. The accused did, it is true, attack the complaining witness, and struck him upon the neck with a bolo, but the fact that the blows were delivered with the back of the weapon is sufficient to preclude the assault’s being classed as frustrated homicide. It does not appear that the accused intended to cause the death of Matias Paguiam. All he did was to beat him with the back of the bolo. <br/><br/>In thus classifying an act according to the purpose of the accused, it is absolutely necessary that the homicidal intent be evidenced by adequate acts which at the time of their execution were unmistakably calculated to produce the death of the victim, since the crime in question is one in which, more than in any other case, the penal law is based upon the material results produced by the criminal act. It is not proper or just to attribute to the delinquent a specific intent to commit the higher crime in the absence of proof to justify such a conclusion. <br/><br/>In the present case it can not be inferred the accused intended to kill Matias Paguiam. He did not strike him with the cutting edge of the bolo. Consequently the assault committed by him does not constitute the crime of frustrated homicide, and the defendant should be acquitted. However, as the facts proved establish an offense necessarily included in that which was the subject-matter of the complaint, the offense committed should be punished by imposing upon the guilty party the corresponding penalty. The judgment of the court below is reversed and Vicente Taguibao y Calimaran acquitted with the costs de oficio. The defendant is condemned to the penalty of five days of arresto menor and to pay a fine of 125 pesetas, or in default thereof its equivalent in subsidiary imprisonment.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The offense charged in the complaint is punishable under the Penal Code now in force by arresto mayor and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas. (Art. 418.) By Act No. 136 of the United States Philippine Commission, section 56 (6), Courts of First Instance are given original jurisdiction  \"in all criminal cases in which a penalty of more than six months’ imprisonment or a fine exceeding one hundred dollars may be imposed.\" The offense was therefore cognizable by the court below unless the fact that the appellant was at the time of its alleged commission an employee of the United States military authorities in the Philippine Islands, and the further fact that the person upon whom it is alleged to have been committed was a prisoner of war in the custody of such authorities, are sufficient to deprive it of jurisdiction. We must assume that both these facts are true, as found, either upon sufficient evidence or upon the admissions of the prosecuting attorney, by the court below. <br/><br/>Setting aside the claim that the appellant was  \"acting in the line of duty\" at the time the alleged offense was committed, which is not supported by the findings or by any evidence which appears in the record, the contention that the court was without jurisdiction, as we understand it, is reducible to two propositions: First, that an assault committed by a soldier or military employee upon a prisoner of war is not an offense under the Penal Code; and second, that if it is an offense under the Code, nevertheless the military character sustained by the person charged with the offense at the time of its commission exempts him from the ordinary jurisdiction of the civil tribunals. <br/><br/>As to the first proposition, it is true, as pointed out by counsel, that an assault of the character charged in the complaint committed in time of war by a military person upon a prisoner of war is punishable as an offense under the Spanish Code of Military Justice (art. 232), and it is also true that under the provisions of the same Code (arts. 4, 5) the military tribunals have, with certain exceptions which it is not materials to state, exclusive cognizance of all offenses, whether of a purely military nature or otherwise, committed by military persons. But the fact that the acts charged in the complaint would be punishable as an offense under the Spanish military legislation does not render them any less an offense under the article of the Penal Code above cited. There is nothing in the language of that article to indicate that it does not apply to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of the law. Under articles 4 and 5 of the Code of Military Justice above cited a military person could not be brought to trial before a civil tribunal for an assault upon a prisoner of war, but by the commission of that offense he incurred a criminal responsibility for which he was amenable only to the military jurisdiction. That criminal responsibility, however, arose from an infraction of the general penal laws, although the same acts, viewed in another aspect, might also, if committed in time of war, constitute an infraction of the general penal laws, although the same acts, viewed in another aspect, might also, if committed in time of war, constitute an infraction of the military code. We are unable to see how these provisions of the Spanish Military Code, no longer in force here and which indeed never had any application to the Army of the United States, can in any possible view have the effect claimed for them by counsel for the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>The second question is, Does the fact that the alleged offense was committed by an employee of the United States military authorities deprive the court of jurisdiction? We have been cited to no provision in the legislation of Congress, and to none in the local legislation, which has the effect of limiting, as respects employees of the United States military establishment, the general jurisdiction conferred upon the Courts of First Instance by Act No. 136 of the United States Philippine Commission above cited, and we are not aware of the existence of any such provision. The case is therefore open to the application of the general principle that the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals is unaffected by the military or other special character of the person brought before them for trial, a principle firmly established in the law of England and America and which must, we think, prevail under any system of jurisprudence unless controlled by express legislation to the contrary. (United States v. Clark, 31 Fed. Rep., 710.) The appellant’s claim that the acts alleged to constitute the offense were performed by him in the execution of the orders of his military superiors may, if true, be available by way of defense upon the merits in the trial in the court below, but can not under this principle affect the right of that court to take jurisdiction of the case. <br/><br/>Whether under a similar state of facts to that which appears in this case a court of one of the United States would have jurisdiction to try the offender against the State laws (see In re Fair, 100 Fed. Rep., 149), it is not necessary to consider. The present is not a case where the courts of one government are attempting to exercise jurisdiction over the military agents or employees of another and distinct government, because the court asserting jurisdiction here derives its existence and powers from the same Government under the authority of which the acts alleged to constitute the offense are claimed to have been performed. <br/><br/>It may be proper to add that there is no actual conflict between the two jurisdictions in the present case nor any claim of jurisdiction on the part of the military tribunals. On the contrary it appears from the findings of the court below that the complaint was entered by order of the commanding general of the Division of the Philippines, a fact not important, perhaps, as regards the technical question of jurisdiction, but which relieves the case from any practical embarrassment which might result from a claim on the part of the military tribunals to exclusive cognizance of the offense. <br/><br/>The order of the court below is affirmed with costs to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I concur in the result of the decision of the court, but am not prepared to assent to all that is said in the opinion. An offense charged against a military officer, acting under the order of his superior, unless the illegality of the order is so clearly shown on its face that a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know when he heard it read or given that the order was illegal, and when the alleged criminal act was done within the scope of his authority as such officer, in good faith and without malice, and where the offense is against the military law — that is, such law as relates to the discipline and efficiency of the Army, or rules and orders promulgated by the Secretary of War to aid military officers in the proper enforcement of the custody of prisoners — is not within the jurisdiction of the courts of the Civil Government. (In re Fair, 100 Fed. Rep., 149.) The civil courts, however, may examine the evidence for the purpose of determining whether the act alleged to be criminal was done in the performance of duty under the circumstances above indicated, but should cease to exercise jurisdiction upon such facts appearing. </div>'\n",

Emeterio Ruiz, 1,121 feet of hose, among other property belonging to said Rastrollo, was attached at the instance of Attorney Florencio Gonzales on behalf of Don Gerardo Urbina. The attached property remained in the possession of the debtor, Rastrollo, who, with the consent of the attorney for the plaintiff, sold the same to the Manila Fire Department. Rastrollo failed to deliver the proceeds of the sale, which took place late in March of this year, to the attorney for the plaintiff, and only deposited the same in the court on the 4th day of June of this year, the day following the filing of the complaint charging him with the crime of embezzlement (estafa). <br/><br/>If the acts of which the accused is charged constitute any crime whatever it would be that of malversation of property attached by judicial order — the crime defined and punished in article 395 in connection with articles 390 and 392 of the Penal Code. The act could not be regarded as constituting estafa under paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Code, because the property alleged to have been misapplied was not the subject of a mere private bailment but of a judicial deposit. This gives the depositary a character equivalent to that of a public official, and a breach of his obligation is similar to the violation of the obligations imposed by public office. <br/><br/>However, as the accused, Rastrollo, in selling the said hose, acted with the knowledge and consent of the attorney for his creditor, since it is proved that the said attorney agreed with the depositary that the proceeds of the sale should be delivered to him, and inasmuch as there is no proof, on the other hand, that the depositary, Rastrollo, appropriated or applied the proceeds of the sale of the hose to his own use or that of others, but has deposited the same in court, although somewhat tardily, it is evident that the defendant has contracted no criminal liability. His act does not include all of the elements which constitute the crime of malversation, or of any other crime, and the irregularity noted in his conduct is chargeable to the attorney for the creditor who might have been prejudiced thereby. <br/><br/>In view of the foregoing considerations, which are completely in accord with the penal law and the conclusions and merits of the case, the accused, Don Carlos Rastrollo, should be acquitted and the judgment appealed from reversed with costs in both instances de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an incident respecting nullity of proceedings, and comes up on appeal from an auto of the Court of First Instance of Intramuros (Manila) sustaining the validity of the proceedings drawn into question. The appellant, Robles, was the plaintiff below in a declarative action of greater import brought to recover for services rendered by him to the appellee, Sanz, the defendant below, as an employee in the latter’s store in Manila from January 9, 1886, to March 12, 1895. One question at issue between the parties was as to whether any payments had ever been made the plaintiff by the defendant on account of said services, the plaintiff alleging in his demand that no such payments had been made and the defendant in his answer alleging the contrary, and specifying the dates and amounts of certain payments, which he stated appeared upon his books of account. <br/><br/>Among other proofs proposed by counsel for the plaintiff was the following:  \"Documentary: I designate as documentary proof the commercial books of the defendant, Don Juan Sanz, where he says the payments of salary received by my principal appear.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant’s books were accordingly examined by the court, due notice to the parties being first given, although neither the plaintiff nor his counsel appears to have been present; and the result of the examination was embodied in a statement specifying certain entries of payments to the plaintiff during the years in question found in the book of accounts-current, and adding that they appeared to have been transferred from the corresponding entries in the daybook and ledger, that the books had been properly stamped, and that the portions where the entries appeared bore no evidence of alterations or erasures. <br/><br/>The appellant’s contention is that as a matter of fact the entries mentioned in this statement were made after the books in which they appeared had been closed, and that the omission to note in the statement this circumstance, which was apparent from the books themselves, rendered the taking of the evidence invalid. In the court below the appellant moved that evidence be taken in the incident to enable him to establish this fact as to the character of the entries, but the court refused the application. He now asks in a petition addressed to this court that the same evidence be taken at second instance. <br/><br/>If the omission to state that the entries appeared to have been made after the books had been closed, such being the fact, would constitute a fatal objection to the legality of the proceedings in the taking of the evidence, the appellant should have been permitted to show the fact in the court below, and not having been permitted to do so there, his petition that the evidence be taken at second instance might properly be granted. But we do not think that the court below was bound to examine the books or to state anything that appeared therein, or any circumstance in connection with them, further than as called upon to do so by the plaintiff in his designation of the evidence which he desired taken. If the plaintiff desired the court to ascertain and state whether the entries appeared to have been made after the books had been closed, he should have so requested at the proper time. Not having done so, he can not object that the failure of the court to examine and report upon the condition of the books in this particular has the effect of invalidating the proceeding, especially as it is at least doubtful whether in the absence of such request the court would have been justified in making such examination. (Art. 47 of the Code of Commerce.) <br/><br/>Assuming, therefore, that the fact which the appellant proposes to prove were established it would have no bearing upon the question involved in this incident. It would undoubtedly tend to discredit the entries as evidence in the main action; but the sole question before us in this incident is a purely procedural one, the determination of which depends in no manner upon the character or value of the evidence of the entries, either considered in itself as it appears in the statement drawn up by the court below or in connection with any qualifying circumstance which might be disclosed upon a further examination of the books. The petition for the taking of evidence at second instance must, therefore, be denied. <br/><br/>These considerations also dispose of the appeal itself, no defect in the proceedings in the taking of the evidence being pointed out other than that which the appellant claims results from the omission of the court to note the character of the entries, as having been made after the books were closed. As already indicated, we are of opinion that this omission does not invalidate the proceeding. <br/><br/>The petition for the taking of evidence at second instance is denied, and the judgment is affirmed with costs to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The said petitioner, during the trial of the case in question, was represented by his attorney, and his attorney was properly notified of the judgment rendered in the said case on December 22, 1898. The said petitioner does not allege that he has been prevented from interposing his appeal by reason of fraud. Nor have any allegations been made which show that it would not have been possible to interpose the appeal in case he had attempted to do so; but in his petition he argues that the court of Quiapo had no jurisdiction over the matter, since the property in question is located in what is now the Province of Rizal and outside of the limits of the territory occupied at that time by the Government of the United States. In the same manner, the said petitioner alleges that  \"having been persuaded that the proceedings held by the court of Quiapo . . . could have no validity or efficacy, both for the reasons indicated and because the judicial terms, according to the royal decree issued on July 26, 1898, by the colonial office (Minister de Ultramar) of the aforesaid Spanish Government were suspended . . . until the date of the treaty of Paris — i.e., until December 10, 1898 — Don Jose Emeterio Guevara did not appeal from that judgment; that his omission to do so was due, therefore, to an excusable accident, to wit, the past occurrences which produced radical changes in all of the orders and in the royal decree above cited.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>These are the only reasons which are alleged. From the above it appears that it was not the royal decree which induced the petitioner to delay his appeal, since he himself states that the said decree remained in force only until December 10, 1898. It may be that he has committed an error with reference to this matter; but such error could not have affected in any manner his action with reference to his appeal. In order that he may avail himself of the said act, it does not suffice that it appear that there was a mistake, but it must likewise appear that he was unable to interpose the appeal by reason of the said mistake. <br/><br/>Furthermore, it is contended that the court below had no jurisdiction over the case in question. It is not incumbent upon us to determine whether or not he is correct in this contention. Even on the supposition that he was right his allegations can not prevail inasmuch as they are based upon the fact that the said court committed an error in deciding that it was competent to determine the matter. The word  \"mistake,\" according to its signification in the act referred to, does not apply, and never was intended to apply, to a judicial error which the court in question might have committed in the trial referred to. Such errors may be corrected by means of an appeal. The act in question can not in any way be employed as a substitute for the said remedy. <br/><br/>In general terms the  \"mistake or excusable negligence\" of which the said act treats should be understood as that committed by the party and not that of the court. <br/><br/>There seems to be a certain contention on the part of the petitioner to the effect that he has the right to said remedy on the ground that the court may have been in the right concerning its jurisdiction and that the petitioner was mistaken in forming a contrary opinion. <br/><br/>It is neither necessary nor proper to establish rules which foretell absolutely all of the cases which may arise under the said act. In order to decide the matter which occupies us at present it suffices to state that the erroneous opinion of one of the parties concerning the incorrectness of the judicial decision of the court can not constitute grounds for the said relief. For example, the court renders judgment in a matter against the defendant. The said defendant believes at the time that said judgment is correct and understands that an appeal would be useless and therefore he does not interpose the same. Later he believes firmly that the said judgment was incorrect, as indeed it was, and that he committed a mistake when he believed that it was correct. This, although it constitutes a mistake of the party, is not such a mistake as confers the right to the relief. This is so because in no wise has he been prevented from interposing his appeal. The most that may be said is that by reason of an erroneous interpretation of the law he believed that all recourse of appeal would be useless. <br/><br/>Therefore, the prayer of the petition is denied with costs against the petitioner. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Ladd, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears in the present cause that on a certain day in the month of December, 1899, Agapito Ramos, upon being taken unawares by his brother-in-law, Inocencio Ancheta, in the act of appropriating a shed roof belonging to the latter, assaulted the said Ancheta, the defendant herein, with his bolo. The latter, warding off the blow, succeeded in securing the weapon, and spurred on by the additional motive of resentment against Ramos because the latter had illicit relations with his wife and left her enceinte, the defendant in turn attacked Ramos, inflicting twenty-one wounds upon his head, face, chest, and other parts of his body. From the effects of these wounds, which, according to the testimony of an herb doctor, were necessarily mortal, Ramos died within a short time. The father and wife of the deceased, however, and a minor daughter 14 years of age found him while still alive and heard him state that his assailant was the defendant, Inocencio Ancheta. <br/><br/>This action having been instituted upon an information filed by the prosecuting attorney, the defendant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty of the crime with which he was charged. As a witness under oath the defendant testified that the deceased sustained illicit relations with his wife on the occasion of his absence for two years in this city, and that he had pardoned them upon receiving a promise that they would not continue their relations; that, nevertheless, his brother-in-law, Agapito Ramos, continued to take advantage of him; that he surprised the latter in his house on the 30th of December; that furthermore the said Ramos carried away a brush shed roof which was the property of defendant, and that upon being required to return it gave the defendant a blow with the bolo which he was carrying; that defendant succeeded in evading the blow and having taken away the bolo, he in his turn attacked Ramos, inflicting upon him the wounds in question; that he immediately gave an account of the occurrence to the local president of the town of Santa Lucia before two witnesses who heard and attested his statements. <br/><br/>The act which gave rise to this proceeding, and which is fully proved in the proceedings held for the purpose of its determination, constitutes the crime of homicide, prohibited and penalized in article 404 of the Code, since there was present at its commission no specific or qualifying circumstance which would give it a graver classification or heavier penalty. <br/><br/>Inocencio Ancheta is the convicted and confessed author of the said crime, inasmuch as, notwithstanding his plea of not guilty, the accused has confessed voluntarily that he caused the violent death of his brother-in-law, Agapito Ramos, for which reason his direct participation in the crime which is prosecuted is indubitable. <br/><br/>In confessing the commission of the crime the defendant alleges in his favor the claim of exemption from responsibility on the ground that he was acting in the legitimate defense of his person, which had been unlawfully attacked, basing his contention on No. 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code. Inasmuch as there was no witness who was present at the occurrence and as the statements of the deceased made just before his death do not contradict or detract from those of the accused in his confession, and considering the merits of the case for and against the prisoner according to the rules of a sound discretion, we are obliged to admit the operation in his favor of the partial exemption to which article 86 of the Penal Code refers. There was an unlawful aggression on the part of Agaton Ramos, according to the statement of the defendant, and the latter did not provoke the affray. It appears, on the contrary, that the prisoner, Ancheta, was the one who had grounds for grievance and complaint against the deceased. Nevertheless, it is likewise an indisputable fact that the defendant did not limit his action to the requirements of his defense, because from the moment in which he succeeded in obtaining possession of the bolo there was no reasonable necessity for inflicting twenty-one wounds upon his aggressor, Agaton Ramos. Therefore the proper penalty is that next lower in grade to the one designated in article 404 of the Code. <br/><br/>In applying this penalty there should be also taken into consideration the circumstances referred to in No. 7 of article 9 and in No. 1 of article 10 of the Penal Code, for the reason that it is a fact duly proved in this cause that the defendant committed the deed when blinded and impelled by the passion of jealousy produced by the illicit relations which the deceased sustained with his wife; and in spite of the fact that the deceased, Agaton Ramos, was the brother-in-law of his slayer, this relationship should be considered in the present case as a mitigating circumstance in view of the conduct pursued by said Ramos in contracting adulterous relations with the wife of the defendant. On these grounds there should be imposed upon the defendant the penalty of prision mayor in its minimum degree. <br/><br/>In view, therefore, of the foregoing considerations, it follows that the sentence reviewed should be affirmed in all its parts with the costs of this instance against the defendant. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">From the record of this case it appears that on the night of May 21, 1900, the body of Catalino Biado’s father was lying in the latter’s house, situated on the outskirts of the town of Paoay, and that on the occasion of his death some seven or more persons had gathered together in the house. Among them was the defendant, Antonio Alegado. A bolo belonging to the latter disappeared, and, on failing to find it after a search for that purpose, he said in a threatening manner that he would burn the house unless that bolo was found. The bolo was not found, and Alegado with a piece of burning bamboo set fire to the house, which was burned to the ground, as well as a granary nearby, together with the rice stored therein. The occupants of the house discovered the fire soon after it broke out, but were unable to extinguish it. The total damage caused by the fire was estimated by experts to amount to 105 pesos and 75 cents. <br/><br/>An information having been presented by the prosecuting attorney and this proceeding instituted, Antonio Alegado pleaded not guilty of the crime with which he was charged. Two witnesses called by the accused to prove his alibi stated that they had gone to the scene of the occurrence in order to assist in extinguishing the fire; and that, although the woman, Basilisa Baraoid, stated to them that Juan Catubay was the incendiary, nevertheless the accused himself told them that it was he who set fire to the said house because he had not found his bolo which was lost therein. <br/><br/>The facts related, which are completely proved in the cause by expert testimony and that of witnesses who were present, constitute the crime of arson, provided for an penalized in article 549 of the Penal Code, for the reason that it appears fully proved in the case that the fire was intentionally started with the malicious intent to destroy the dwelling house of Catalino Biado at a time when it was occupied by seven persons and a corpse. <br/><br/>It can not be disputed that the defendant has violated the article cited and incurred its very grave responsibility, inasmuch as, although he pleaded not guilty of the crime of which he was accused, the incriminating circumstances and other weighty merits which the case discloses produce the full conviction of his delinquency. The defendant is incriminated not only by witnesses who were present but likewise by the very witnesses whom he had called to prove his innocence. Nor can it be proper to consider that he was ignorant of whether or not there was anyone present in the interior of the house destroyed, for the reason that he was present in that house a few moments before and even threatened those in the house that he would set fire to the same if he did not find the bolo which he was seeking. Therefore, he well knew that the house contained persons and even a corpse. <br/><br/>For the sole purpose of reducing the penalty to the minimum grade article 11 of the Penal Code will be applied in this case. The judgment reviewed is affirmed. It is understood, nevertheless, that the defendant is sentenced to the penalty of twelve years and one day of cadena temporal, together with the accessory penalties and the payment of the costs in this instance. The order declaring the defendant insolvent, made in the incidental proceeding of attachment, and ordering that after dissolving the attachment the rice field of the value of 4 pesos which was attached be restored to the accused, is affirmed and approved. In consideration of the fact that in the strict application of said article 549 of the Penal Code to the present case, the penalty therein prescribed is evidently excessive, taking into account the degree of malice and the damage caused by the crime, it is believed proper and just to apply the rule of article 2, paragraph 2, of the same Code by calling the attention of the Civil Governor to the case.

The accused was tried for seduction in the court of the justice of the peace of Binondo, and judgment of conviction was there rendered against him. He appealed from this judgment to the Court of First Instance of Manila, which took cognizance of the case on appeal and gave judgment affirming the judgment of the justice of the peace. From this judgment an appeal to this court was admitted. <br/><br/>The motion must be granted. Section 43 of General Orders, No. 58, permits an appeal in this class of cases only when there is involved the constitutionality or validity of a law. The accused alleges that General Orders, No. 58, is a law in force; that the said order repealed the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure, and that he should have been tried in accordance with the provisions of said general order. The question whether one law repeals another is not a question that involves the validity of the law which is alleged to have been repealed, within the meaning of the exception. This exception refers only to those cases in which it is contended that a law was invalid from the time of its passage. In the present case there is no such contention. It results that all of the questions which are sought to be presented by means of this appeal were determined by the judgment of the Court of First Instance, and that in accordance with the provisions of section 43 of the abovementioned General Orders, No. 58, the said judgment is final and of such character that it can not be the subject of review in this court. <br/><br/>Wherefore, the motion of the appellee is granted and the cause is remanded to the Court of First Instance, whence it has proceeded, for its action in accordance herewith, with the costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears that this case was instituted in order to prosecute the defendant for the crime of official dereliction with which he is charged. The alleged crime consisted in that the defendant, Florentino Narvaes, being a justice of the peace of the town of Bulusan, permitted the game of monte to be played in his house, in which the justice court was installed, on the nights of August 15 and 20 and November 27, 1892; and likewise in that monte was played in another house belonging to the said Narvaes situated in the township of San Isidro on the occasion of a holiday which was there celebrated. These facts appear proved by the testimony of several witnesses, some of whom participated in those prohibited games. <br/><br/>Although the crime which is the subject of this case is that of official dereliction provided for and penalized in article 355 of the Penal Code, and not that of unlawful gambling embraced in article 343 of the said Code, nevertheless this decision must be directed to the question of whether or not the crime of unlawful gambling was committed by the individuals who played monte in the house of the defendant, who was at that time a justice of the peace, in order to determine whether or not there existed the crime of official dereliction. In other words, it must be determined whether the defendant, as justice of the peace, in violation of his duties willfully omitted to institute proceedings for the prosecution and punishment of the players who, with his knowledge and consent, played monte on three occasions at the house of the defendant. <br/><br/>Article 343 of the Penal Code imposes criminal responsibility upon, and designates the respective penalties incurred by, the bankers, the owners of the gambling house, and the players who assemble in such houses kept for playing games of chance or hazard. And as it does not appear from the record that the house of the defendant, Narvaes, was reputed to be a gambling house, it must be held that the offense punished by the law has not been committed, notwithstanding the fact that certain individuals had there played the prohibited game of monte, for the reason that said house was not known as one devoted to gambling and dedicated exclusively to the harboring of this repugnant vice. <br/><br/>Under this view of the matter it follows that the accused has not committed the crime of official dereliction, nor has he incurred the criminal responsibility of having consented to the commission of a punishable act and having willfully failed to institute proceedings to prosecute and punish offending gamblers. <br/><br/>Therefore, since the crime of official dereliction does not exist, the defendant should be acquitted with costs de oficio and the court below should proceed in accordance with law in the matter of the attachment of his property.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant is charged with the crime of estafa alleged to consist in the concealment of a private document evidencing a deposit of 2,600 pesos delivered by Fulgencia Tuason to the Chinaman Jose Palanca Yu-Tivo. <br/><br/>It appears from the testimony of the witness Balbino Tuason and Macario Deirit that Fulgencia Tuason delivered to Jose Palanca Yu-Tivo through them the sum of 2,600 pesos for the purpose of preventing the money of being seized by the Spanish Government. It also appears from authentic documents in the record that Fulgencia Tuason in September, 1898, went to the Provost-Marshal-General of this city with a complaint concerning the deposit of 2,600 pesos which she had deposited with the Chinaman Jose Palanca Yu-Tivo. In the petition which she presented to the Provost-General she asserted that she had in her possession a receipt for this deposit. This receipt, according to the statement of complaining witness, was subsequently delivered by her to the defendant, he having offered to collect the amount of the deposit from the Chinaman Yu-Syna, the son and attorney in fact of Jose Palanca, the latter being absent at that time in China. This according to the complaining witness occurred in the following manner:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Yu-Syna refused to pay the total amount of the money deposited and having on two occasions delivered to her on account the sum of only 250 pesos, the defendant, Tan Jenjua, a relative of Yu-Syna, came to her house one day and told her to come to see him and he would arrange matters. She went to see him on the day following and the defendant then promised to collect part of the money in a short time. Two days afterwards she returned and Tan Jenjua paid her the sum of 300 pesos. At the same time upon the pretext that he would undertake to settle up the affair of Jose Palanca and Yu-Syna, he asked the complaining witness to give him the receipt for the deposit, promising to deliver the balance of the money deposited within a period of two or three months. Trusting in Tan Jenjua’s good faith and fearing that impending hostilities might break out at any time, the complaining witness consented and the receipt was accordingly delivered in the presence of the Chinaman Lim-Kayco and two Filipinos, Daniel and Antonio. Some months afterwards the complaining witness made demand for the 2,050 pesos still due on the deposit and defendant refused not only to settle the matter but also to return the receipt for the deposit, whereupon a complaint was filed by the prosecuting witness. The latter further states that the document in question was written in Chinese, which language she is unable to read, and that when Palanca gave it to her it was a receipt for the deposit. <br/><br/>The witness Antonio Deirit testifies to having been present at the time the defendant delivered the 300 pesos to the complaining witness, Fulgencia Tuason, and also at the time written in Chinese characters, on which occasion, according to this witness, after the accused had read the document, he told the complaining witness that according to that paper she still had 2,050 pesos due her and that he would undertake to settle the matter. Daniel Lamprano corroborates the testimony of this witness and that of the complainant stating that he saw the sum of 300 pesos referred to upon a table, while a Chinaman whom he did not know and the woman Fulgencia were in conversation together and he at the same time observed that the Chinaman had a paper in his hand which he subsequently put into a drawer in the table. It is of no importance that Lamprano did not know the Chinaman to whom he referred, because he was known by the witness Deirit and by the complainant. Furthermore it is to be observed that the combined testimony of the three is to the effect that the paper of which Lamprano spoke was the same document which had just been delivered by the complainant to the accused. These witness corroborated each other’s testimony by referring to the same occasion, time, and place. <br/><br/>There is no reason for believing that the complainant’s statement in the petition presented to the Provost-Marshal General in September, 1898, to be the effect that she had in her possession a receipt for the deposit, was untrue. On the contrary, it is to be supposed that when this statement was made she was really in a position to exhibit the receipt in case the Provost-Marshal-General should require its presentation. It can not be presumed that at that time she had formed the design of drawing up a complaint, both for the reason that the complaint was not presented until a year and a half later and because there are no data upon which such a presumption may be based. To this we may add that as the deposit was actually made as shown by this testimony of the two witness, it was natural and logical that the complaint should have demanded from the depositor the receipt as evidence thereof. Thereof, if that receipt was still in her possession, it is not probable that she would falsely pretend not to have it and assert the defendant had concealed it against her will, because such an assertion would make it impossible for her to make use of this document for the purpose of collecting the deposit until such time as its return to her should be made to appear. It is not credible that the defendant would voluntarily deprive herself of such proof of the deposit, which would doubtless be the most certain and efficacious is an action to enforce its collection, unless it be fully proven that she is impelled to act in this singular manner by some interest superior to the interest she must have in the collection of the 2,050 pesos still remaining unpaid the amount deposited. <br/><br/>In view of the testimony in the record, supported by the reasons above set forth, one is convicted of the reality of the delivery by the complainant to the accused of the document evidencing the deposit in question. <br/><br/>It is of no importance that the document is written in Chinese and that neither the complainant nor her witnesses can read this language, inasmuch as from the evidence in the record the true nature of the document may readily be inferred. It is evident that the accused had great interest in obtaining possession of this document inasmuch as he was willing to sacrifice the sum of 300 pesos to that end. The delivery of this money by him to the complainant is sufficiently proven by the evidence introduced. The interest of the defendant stands in itself sufficient and convincing proof of the value and importance of the document. It must be either the receipt for the deposit or nothing at all upon the facts presented by this case, and if the latter be the case, it can not be understood nor could it be satisfactorily explained why the accused should have displayed such an interest in obtaining its possession. This consideration acquires greater force if one of the same keeps in view of the fact to which the witness Deirit testified, to the effect that the defendant said to the complainant, after having read this document, that it appeared therefrom that she still had due her 2,050 pesos from the 2,600 deposited after deducting the 250 pesos formerly delivered to her by Yu-Syna and the 300 which at that time had just been delivered to her by the accused the latter’s refusal to return the document is shown in the record solely by the testimony of the complaining witness. No other witness testifies upon this point nor has any attempt been made to introduce evidence on the subject. Nevertheless we can entertain no reasonable doubt as to the truth of this fact. Supposing that the complainant had no difficulty in recovering possession of the document, unquestionably she would not have failed to do so when it is considered that the recovery of the document was a matter of great interested to her as evidence of a deposit of a considerable sum of money. Furthermore, if this fact was not true, the defendant could have shown such to be the case from the first by simply returning the document; it was to his interest to do so, but nevertheless he has not done it. The failure to return the document up to the present time, notwithstanding the criminal prosecution brought against him on this account, conclusively shows his determination to conceal the paper. There are some facts which do not require proof because they are self-evident; and the unvarying attitude of the defendant in this case is the most complete and convincing proof of his refusal to return the document. <br/><br/>The concealment of that document causes a positive injury to the complainant because it dispossess her of evidence of a deposit of considerable value, thereby making it difficult for her to enforce the collection of this sum by adequate means. For the purpose of proving the existence of this damage it is unnecessary to inquire whether as a matter of fact she has ever succeeded in collecting the deposit or not. The commission of the crime herein prosecuted is entirely independent of that subsequent and casual event of which, whatever it may be, can in no wise have any influence upon the legal effects of the concealment already consummated of the document is question. <br/><br/>The extent of a fraud when it consists of the concealment of a document should be graded according to the amount which the document represents, as it is evident that the gravity of the damage resulting therefrom would not be the same, for instance, in the case of the concealment of a document representing $30 as in the cased of one representing $30,000. In support of this doctrine several decisions of the supreme court of Spain may be cited, among others, that of April 23, 1880. The document concealed in the present case represents a value of 2,050 pesos, and consequently this must serve as a basis for grading the penalty corresponding to the crime. The damage here in question results from the deprivation suffered by the complainant of the document evidencing the deposit and not of the loss of the deposit itself. The concealment of the document referred to does not necessarily involve the loss of the money deposited, and for this reason it would not be just to give judgment against the defendant for the payment of that amount. <br/><br/>The court therefore declares that the defendant should be convicted and sentenced to one year eight months and twenty-one days of presidio correccional with the corresponding accessories and the payment of the costs of both instances. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed thus modified is affirmed. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that the appellants in this case occupied the building at No. 14 Escolta Street, known by the name of the English Dispensary and being a part of the property of the Enriquez estate, under a lease thereof, from January, 1900, was paid twice; first to the administrator of the estate and later deposited in court. The appellee seeks now to evict the appellants from said property, alleging as his ground therefor the nonpayment of the amount of rent corresponding to said period. <br/><br/>The situation in which Messrs. Watson &amp; Co. are found in this case is due principally, in our opinion, to the litigation between the Enriquez brothers over the estate of their deceased parents. During the first period abovementioned the administration of said property passed three times from the hands of one to those of the other of the brothers, Francisco and Rafael. The claim made by Don Rafael does not refer to the failure to pay the said rents but to the fact that these were paid improperly to his brother. It is not surprising that with these frequent changes of administrators the tenants of the properties of the estate have committed mistakes in the payments. <br/><br/>The judgment, whose execution is sought in this case, was rendered by default on June 20, 1900. The summons was served upon the person in charge of the establishment, who was denied an extension of some days which he applied for by reason of the absence of the attorney in fact of the house. this judgment became final, and although it is not proper for us, perhaps, to inquire into the merits of said judgment for the purpose of determining its annulment, we can take into consideration the antecedents of the case so far as they serve to make clear the succeeding acts of Don Francisco as well as of Don Rafael. If the rents whose alleged nonpayment gave rise to said action have been actually received by the Enriquez estate the abandonment of the judgment could be more readily deduced from the succeeding facts than if they had not been paid at any time. <br/><br/>After the 1st day of September, 1900, it was Don Francisco who had charge of the administration of the estate. The court notified the appellants that they should recognize him as such. After the said date the said Francisco recognized the appellants as the tenants of the estate and continued to receive from them the amount of the rents until January 25, 1901, when a new lease for twelve years was entered into. Although said lease may have been void it is true that the contracting parties conformed to its terms, paying the amount of the stipulated rent to Don Francisco from January 25, 1901, to April 1. the latter likewise had previously received the rents corresponding to the months from January to May, 1900, which, according to the allegations of Don Rafael, were not paid. As a result of these allegations the judgment referred to was entered. The facts related disclose to us conclusively that Don Francisco never intended to ask the execution of this judgment nor considered Messrs. Watson &amp; Co. evicted, but rather as actual tenants. <br/><br/>As for Don Rafael, his attorney stated before this court that upon assuming charge of the property in February, 1901, he demanded of the appellants the amount of the rents. The statements of his attorney would contradict and be inconsistent with any theory other than that the rents thus demanded were those accrued under the new lease of January 25, 1901. The appellants paid to him the rents from April, but refused to pay that corresponding to the month of March, stating that they had already paid the same to Don Francisco. As a result of this refusal proceedings were had for the purpose of reviving the old judgment of the previous year. It appears to us that the true reason which prompted this action was not the nonpayment of the rents from January to May, 1900, but the fact of the nonpayment to Don Rafael of those corresponding to the month of March, 1901. The original judgment can not be utilized for such purpose. If there has been such failure to pay the rent corresponding to the month last named, Don Rafael ought to have presented the proper complaint, basing it upon that fact. It is not the contract above referred to entered into with the administrator Don Francisco which gives rise to the re-leasing of the property, but the successive acts of administration of the latter, recognizing it in the name of the estate whose representative he alone was — acts neither impugned nor declared void until now, by virtue of which he has accepted the agreements of the tenant which until now have likewise not been rejected by the estate or objected to in any way. <br/><br/>In view of the established facts above related we are of the opinion and decide that there have been subsequent juridical acts between the appellants on one side and on the other the Enriquez estate, represented either by Don Francisco or by Don Rafael, by virtue of which the said appellants must have continued as such tenants of the estate, notwithstanding the judgment given on June 20, 1900, which by reason of the very acts of the plaintiff estate has become ineffective and has lost its executory force. <br/><br/>Wherefore the judgment appealed from is reversed with costs taxed to the appellee, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that on the night of March 24, 1897, in the town of Lumban, near Pila, a quarrel broke out between Geronimo Linac and Julian Bertucio. the cause of the quarrel was the refusal of Linac to work for Bertucio in order to pay off a dollar which he owed the latter, as he had been requested to do. In the course of the quarrel Bertucio seriously wounded Linac on the right wrist with a bolo. Bernabe Gasapangra, taking part in the affray in aid of Linac, attacked Bertucio in turn and inflicted three bolo wounds upon the latter’s head. these wounds were healed with medical assistance in ten days and left no ill results. Geronimo Linac died on the night of the day following the occurrence as the result of a hemorrhage from the wound in his wrist. <br/><br/>When Bernabe Gasapangra was found by the police in a cane field, where he hid himself after the occurrence, he attempted to escape and refused to surrender when called upon to do so. In order to prevent his escape and owing to the fact that he was armed with a bolo, some of the arresting party were forced to throw stones at him and employ violence as a result of which he received several wounds of lesser gravity, which healed in the course of some twelve days without causing any permanent injury. <br/><br/>The facts proved in the present case constitute two crimes — one of homicide committed upon the person of Geronimo Linac, included in the terms of article 404 of the Penal Code; the other, that of an assault of lesser gravity upon Julian Bertucio, prohibited and penalized in article 418 of the said Code. In the crime of homicide there appear none of the specific qualifying circumstances enumerated in articles 402 and 403 of said Penal Code to be considered. <br/><br/>The guilt of the defendant Bertucio of this crime of homicide has been conclusively established by the evidence. His exculpative allegations can not be admitted on account of the lack of proof and because of the self-contradictory character of his statements. Furthermore, the fact is proven that he was the only person who had a disagreement with the deceased. The accused himself stated that the deceased might have been the one who inflicted the wounds which he had received upon the head. It is likewise a fact shown at the trial that the other defendant, Bernabe Gasapangra, is responsible for these wounds of the prisoner Bertucio, the former’s guilt being likewise established by conclusive evidence. Notwithstanding his denial and the representations he made to demonstrate his innocence, the case offers sufficient data and merits to fully convince the court that Bernabe Gasapangra attacked Bertucio after seeing the latter inflict a grave wound upon his relative, Geronimo Linac, and that he then hid himself in a canebrake, where it was necessary for the authorities to use force and violence in order to apprehend him. <br/><br/>With reference to the commission of the homicide there must be considered the presence of the extenuating circumstance, No. 3 of article 9 of the Code, in that the aggressor Bertucio confined himself to the giving of a single blow of his bolo upon the right arm of the injured party and that he did not repeat this blow — thus showing that he had no intention of occasioning an injury as grave and irreparable as the death of Linac. Although the latter died on the night of the succeeding day, this was due to neglect and the lack of medical treatment, his death having resulted from a hemorrhage which they did not know how to stop or control in time. This circumstance, as well as the established in article 11 of the Code, deemed very applicable in the present case, determine that there should be imposed upon the culprit the penalty next lower in grade to that designated for the crime in article 404, there being no aggravating circumstance to consider which might neutralize the effect. <br/><br/>With reference to the crime of assault of lesser gravity (lesiones menos graves), the presence of the mitigating circumstance established in article 11 must be considered, as well as that of No. 24 of article 10 of the Code, since the defendant Gasapangra in committing the offense made use of a weapon of a kind prohibited by the prevailing laws. <br/><br/>As for the assault of lesser gravity committed upon Gasapangra by the authorities, inasmuch as the latter acted in the performance of their duties and in the legitimate exercise of their authority they are exempt from criminal responsibility and must be acquitted. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated, Julian Bertucio should be condemned to eight years and one day of prision mayor, together with the subsidiary penalties designated in article 61 of the Code and to the payment of the one-third part of the costs in both instances, without judgment of money indemnity by reason of the express waiver of the heirs of the deceased; and Bernabe Gasapangra as the perpetrator of the assault should be condemned to two months and one day of arresto mayor, together with the payment of an indemnity of 50 pesetas to Julian Bertucio and in case of insolvency to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment and to the payment of another third part of the costs, computing in the principal penalty and in the subsidiary imprisonment one-half of the time spent in provisional imprisonment; and the charge of assault of lesser gravity inflicted upon Gasapangra should be absolutely dismissed with the remaining third part of the costs de oficio; the bolos used should be confiscated and the order declaring the insolvency of the parties made in the incidental proceeding of attachment should be approved. <br/><br/>In these terms the present cause should be decided, affirming the judgment appealed from in so far as the same agrees with this decision and reversing it in so far as it conflicts therewith. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The judge had no right to compel the accused to make any statement whatever. The requirement that he do so was an infringement of the rights guaranteed to the accused by section 15 of General Orders, No. 58. It does not appear affirmatively that the latter had any knowledge of his right to refuse to make such a statement. The error committed by the court is explained in view of the relative order in which sections 18 and 19 are placed. Under the correct interpretation of these sections the accused has a certain time within which he may determine in what manner he will answer the complaint. He may interpose a demurrer or file either of the two exceptions, Nos. 3 and 4 of section 24, or he may waive all of these and simply plead  \"not guilty.\" When he has so pleaded the cause is at issue and ready for trial and nothing further may be exacted of him either by way of statement or testimony. <br/><br/>The sentence reviewed is reversed and all proceedings subsequent to the plea of  \"not guilty\" are declared null.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that on the morning of August 21, 1897, Florentina Jarrilla, moved by the passion of jealousy and resentment against Natalia Diño on account of the amorous relations maintained between the latter and the former’s husband, Norberto Disglasan, proceeded to destroy with a bolo one of the partitions of the house of the complaining witness, Natalia Diño, while the latter was absent from the same and while her two minor daughters — the elder of whom was 12 years of age and is the only one who could testify at the trial — were playing nearby. After having dragged the partition some distance from said house she set fire to the same, and as the wind then blowing was in the direction of the house, that burned likewise, together with its contents, valued together with the house at 9 pesos 4 reales and 4 cuartos. <br/><br/>The facts above related, fully proved by the testimony of witnesses, expert testimony, ocular inspection, and confession of the accused, constitute the crime of arson by reckless negligence and the misdemeanor of malicious mischief included in article 568 in connection with articles 553, 554, 555, and 601 of the Penal Code. Therefore the destruction of the complainant’s house by Florentina Jarrilla is not a felony but only the misdemeanor of malicious mischief. The entire house was not worth more than 3 pesos. Only one of the partitions which was separated from the house was destroyed and this part of the dwelling could not possibly exceed 125 pesetas in value. For this reason the justice of the peace had jurisdiction to punish this misdemeanor of malicious mischief. <br/><br/>The burning referred to, as has been said, constitutes a crime by reckless negligence, since it is conclusively established that the accused set fire to the partition screen of the house which had previously been separated and placed a certain distance from it. It does not appear that in doing so she had any malicious intent to burn any other part of the house. Although the entire house was burned, this was due to the wind, which communicated the fire from the ignited partition screen to the house. For this reason the act done without premeditated malice by reason of the lack of criminal intent to burn the house merely constitutes arson by imprudence. <br/><br/>Under this view, as the facts only constitute a minor offense, and as this arson, had the element of malice been present, would have fallen under the provisions of article 555, it is evident that as this element is lacking the offense must be classified as arson by reckless negligence. As the accused acted under the impulse of the passion of jealousy, circumstance No. 7 of article 9 of the Code must be considered in mitigation, and therefore the proper penalty is that of arresto mayor in its minimum and medium degrees, applied in the minimum grade, and therefore we are of the opinion that Florentina Jarrilla should be condemned to the penalty of one month and a day of arresto mayor, to the accessories of article 61, to the indemnification of the damages occasioned or subsidiary imprisonment corresponding thereto, and to the payment of costs. In computing the principal and subsidiary penalty allowance should be made of one-half of the provisional imprisonment suffered and the order declaring the insolvency in the incident of attachment should be approved.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This action was commenced by virtue of the information of the prosecuting attorney accusing the defendant of having fired two shots from his revolver at Don Manuel Rojas, killing him instantly and wounding at the same time Don Anastasio Franco y Francisco, without causing his death, however. It was considered that both crimes were the result of a single act and that the attack was made with treachery (alevosia), and the information charged the compound crime of murder and grave assault (lesiones graves). The defendant pleaded not guilty. <br/><br/>It appears proved at the trial that on the morning of May 7, 1900, the agents of the steamer Don Jose, which was anchored in the river in this city at the time, and of which the accused was captain, dismissed the latter from said position, ordering him to turn over command of the vessel to the first mate of the same. With or without cause the defendant attributed his dismissal to a difficulty that he had previously had with Rojas, who was the engineer of the same steamer, and he so stated to the employee of the agents who notified him of his discharge. This took place in the office of the said agents, and upon the return of the defendant to the steamer Don Jose there occurred on board of the same the act which is here prosecuted. <br/><br/>The accused fired two shots from a revolver — the first aimed at Rojas, who fell dead on the spot, and the second aimed at Anastasio Franco, who was standing near Rojas at that moment, causing the latter wounds which were healed in twenty — eight days. Thus Franco testifies positively, and his testimony is likewise confirmed by the defendant’s own witnesses. All of them saw the latter disputing angrily with the deceased; some say that he had a revolver in his hand at that moment; others saw the revolver immediately after hearing the shots, and still others affirm that it was he who fired the said shots. These statements considered together produce the complete conviction that the accused was the author of the act complained of. <br/><br/>His very defense concedes the truth of the fact that he caused the death of Rojas, although he alleges that he did it in self-defense. The defense endeavored to establish that Rojas assaulted the accused with an iron instrument and that the latter found himself obliged to fire the revolver which he was carrying in order to repel the attack. Three witnesses were offered for this purpose. One of these affirms that he saw the deceased raise his hand to assault the defendant with an iron instrument, while the remaining two confine themselves to stating in vague and general terms that they saw the deceased in the attitude of assaulting the accused with said instrument, without defining the concrete fact of in what the attitude consisted. The remaining witnesses for the defense were not offered to prove this point and do not say a single word concerning any such attack. <br/><br/>The first witness is without doubt the most important for the purpose of the defense. This witness was a member of the crew of the steamer Don Jose, and says that he saw the attack made by the deceased, because at that moment he was passing by the scene of the occurrence in order to go to the bow of the steamer. If the witness was on the spot at the precise moment when the deceased attacked the defendant, and the latter fired the revolver for the express purpose of preventing the assault, as is alleged by the defense, it would be natural and logical that the said witness would likewise have witnessed the firing of the revolver, because both acts must have been simultaneous or at least must have succeeded each other without appreciable interval of time. If the act occurred in any other way, even though there had really been an attack, the alleged defensive action would not be fully justified in the eyes of the law. If any time intervened between the supposed attack of the deceased and the firing of the revolver by the defendant, the latter’s actions would cease to have the true character of a real defense, which, in order to be legally sufficient, requires primarily and as an essential condition that the attack be immediately present. The witness could not observe the one and be ignorant of the other if a true act of self-defense is in question. The firing of the revolver would necessarily have been witnessed by him, as well as the attack which the defendant is supposed to have tried to stop thereby. In such event he would not be ignorant of the fact that the death of the victim was the result of the dispute which occurred between the latter and the accused. Yet the witness states that he is ignorant of all this, giving us to understand that he did not witness the death of Rojas nor the firing of the revolver which caused the same, although these things must have occurred exactly at the moment when he found himself on the scene of the happening or very close thereto, if his testimony and the allegations of the defense be true. From another point of view his testimony can not serve in any way to establish the case of defense alleged by the prisoner, inasmuch as he does not know how the death of Rojas occurred, which is equivalent to saying that he is ignorant of the details and circumstances under which the act complained of took place. <br/><br/>The foregoing comments are applicable likewise in a certain way to the two witnesses who state that they saw the deceased in the attitude of attacking the defendant. They testify that in passing along the levee near which the steamer Don Jose was anchored and when they were some thirty yards distant therefrom, they saw Rojas in that attitude disputing hotly with the accused. They continued on their way and a few moments later heard two shots which seemed to them to proceed from the place where the former were disputing. One of the witnesses had walked ten paces when he heard the shots, the other could not estimate the space of time that had intervened between the two periods. Both had learned later only by hearsay from other persons that the defendant had killed Rojas. If examined carefully it appears from the testimony of these witnesses that they did not witness the occurrence in question but merely a detail which might be called preliminary thereto. They did not witness the defendant’s act of discharging the revolver, neither did they witness the death of Rojas; therefore their testimony even considered as wholly veracious does not and can not avail to determine the manner in which occurred that fact which is the most important and essential in the trial. Although they had actually seen the deceased in the attitude of attacking the accused, their testimony would not serve the purpose of the defense since it does not necessarily imply the act which the attitude threatened. As a general rule the mere attitude of attack does not itself constitute a real attack, that conclusive and positive aggression which justifies the defense of one’s person. In the present case if the said attitude had been a real attack and the defendant had made use of his revolver necessarily to prevent or repel the same, this defensive act must needs have occurred at the very moment at which the supposed attack was made, in which case the witnesses who saw the attack would not have failed to see the use of the revolver, nor would there have intervened between the one and the other the interval of time which they give to understand in their respective statements. <br/><br/>In view of the foregoing considerations we hold the testimony of the said witnesses insufficient to prove the fact of the attack attributed to the deceased. We are confirmed in this view by the testimony of the wounded man, Anastasio Franco, who was standing by the deceased when the occurrence in question took place. He gives positive assurance that the deceased had not committed any act of aggression when he was attacked by the defendant. It is likewise noteworthy that none of the remaining witnesses offered by the defendant say a single word concerning any such attack. One of them saw the act of the defendant’s firing upon the deceased; he describes the relative position occupied by the one and the other, marks the distance which separated the two, and finally he saw Rojas fall wounded by the shot. This witness seems to have attentively observed the principal details of the occurrence and nevertheless he makes no mention of that supposed attack. If the latter actually existed it is not probable that the witness, placed in such circumstances, would have failed to see it, and it is even less probable that, having seen it, he would have omitted to mention the same in his testimony, especially as a witness for the defendant. <br/><br/>Inasmuch as the said attack is not proved it is not necessary to enter upon an examination of the remaining requisites which the Penal Code establishes as necessary for the exemption from responsibility on the ground of self-defense. Since the unlawful attack is the basis and foundation of this defense, when the same does not exist it is not possible to imagine a case of defense in the true meaning of the law. <br/><br/>The doctors who held the autopsy upon the remains of the deceased make it appear that the projectile entered the latter’s chest and left the body at the shoulder, from which it is to be deduced that he was in front of the aggressor when he received the wound. This is likewise testified to by several witnesses, others stating besides that they saw the parties disputing hotly between themselves a few moments before they heard the reports and that the deceased then held in his hand an iron instrument some two hands in length. <br/><br/>Under these circumstances it can not be maintained with reason that the attack which caused the death of Rojas was committed with treachery, as set forth in the complaint, in order to characterize the act complained of as murder. The act having been preceded by a dispute which on account of its heat partook of the character of a genuine quarrel, the deceased was enabled to guard himself in tiem against the consequences that the affair might lead to, and to provide himself against any act of force which his adversary might commit to the peril of his person, especially as the deceased was armed with an iron instrument which was large enough to serve as no inconsiderable medium of defense. Furthermore, it does not appear that the prisoner employed means which would tend to render impossible any attempt at defense on the part of the deceased, and this it is which constitutes the characteristic and essential element of treachery (alevosia). For this reason the act in question should be classed as homicide defined and penalized in article 404 of the Penal Code and not as murder, since the circumstance of treachery was not involved in its commission, nor any other one of the remaining qualifying circumstances which article 403 of said Code mentions in its limitations. <br/><br/>There is to be considered in the commission of the said crime the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation induced by the belief which the defendant entertained, with or without reason, that the deceased was the cause of his dismissal. The chagrin of that dismissal and the consideration of the damage it might cause him not only in his material interests but also in his reputation were without doubt sufficiently powerful reasons for confusing his reason and impelling him to commit the attack of which the deceased was the victim. <br/><br/>There is no opportunity in the present case to pronounce any judgment concerning the injuries to Anastasio Franco. These were not caused by the same shot which caused the death of Rojas. The latter was killed by the first shot. The defendant then discharged his revolver a second time, and that was when he wounded Franco. Upon the firing of the second shot the deceased had already fallen to the ground; wherefore it is apparent that the same was not aimed at the latter but at Franco, who testifies conclusively. Under such circumstances, although the two shots were fired successively, they do not constitute a single act, but two acts wholly distinct, not only on account of their own intrinsic duality but also on account of the fact that they were directed against two different persons. Therefore the provision of article 89 of the Penal code is not applicable to these acts. The said injuries constituting, then, a distinct act, independent of the homicide committed upon the person of Rojas, they should be made the subject of another proceeding or action separate and independent of the present case in accordance with section 11 of General Orders, No. 58. <br/><br/>By virtue of all of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that there should be imposed upon the defendant the penalty of twelve years and a day of reclusion temporal with the corresponding accessory punishments, the payment of an indemnity of 1,000 pesos to the heirs of the deceased, but without the personal subsidiary responsibility in case of insolvency by virtue of the provisions of article 51 of the Penal Code, and the costs of this instance.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an incident of want of personality of the plaintiff’s attorney. The action is to recover a sum claimed to be due for freight under a charter party. It was brought by virtue of a general power for suits, executed in Manila October 27, 1900, by Fernando Kammerzell, and purporting to be a substitution in favor of several attorneys of powers conferred upon Kammerzell in an instrument executed in Berlin, Germany, February 5, 1900, by Max Leonard Tornow, the sole owner of the business carried on in Berlin and Manila under the name of Germann &amp; Co. The first-named instrument was authenticated by a notary with the formalities required by the domestic laws. The other was not so authenticated. Both Tornow and Kammerzell are citizens of Germany. Tornow is a resident of Berlin and Kammerzell of Manila. <br/><br/>The defendants claim that the original power is invalid under article 1280, No. 5, of the Civil Code, which provides that powers for suits must be contained in a public instrument. No claim is made that the document was not executed with the formalities required by the German law in the case of such an instrument. We see no reason why the general principle that the formal validity of contracts is to be tested by the laws of the country where they are executed should not apply. (Civil Code, art. 11.) <br/><br/>The defendants also claim that the original power can not be construed as conferring upon Kammerzell authority to institute or defend suits, from which contention, if correct, it would of course follow that the delegated power is invalid. In support of this contention reliance is placed upon article 1713 of the Civil Code, by which it is provided that  \"an agency stated in general terms only includes acts of administration,\" and that  \"in order to compromise, alienate, mortgage, or to execute any other act of strict ownership an express commission is required.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It has been argued by counsel for the plaintiffs that these provisions of the domestic law are not applicable to the case of an agency conferred, as was that in question, by one foreigner upon another in an instrument executed in the country of which both were citizens. We shall not pass upon this question, since we are clearly of opinion that the instrument contains an explicit grant of a power broad enough to authorize the bringing of the present action, even assuming the applicability of the domestic law as claimed by the defendants. <br/><br/>By this instrument Tornow constitutes Kammerzell his  \"true and lawful attorney with full power to enter the firm name of Germann &amp; Co. in the Commercial Registry of the city of Manila as a branch of the house of Germann &amp; Co. in Berlin, it being the purpose of this power to invest said attorney with full legal powers and authorization to direct and administer in the city of Manila for us and in our name a branch of our general commercial business of importation and exportation, for which purpose he may make contracts of lease and employ suitable assistants, as well as sign every kind of documents, accounts, and obligations connected with the business which may be necessary, take charge in general of the receipt and delivery of merchandise connected with the business, sign all receipts for sums of money and collect them and exact their payment by legal means, and in general execute all the acts and things necessary for the perfect carrying on of the business committed to his charge in the same manner as we could do ourselves if we were present in the same place.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We should not be inclined to regard the institution of a suit like the present, which appears to be brought to collect a claim accruing in the ordinary course of the plaintiff’s business, as properly belonging to the class of acts described in article 1713 of the Civil Code as acts  \"of strict ownership.\" It seems rather to be something which is necessarily a part of the mere administration of such a business as that described in the instrument in question and only incidentally, if at all, involving a power to dispose of the title to property. <br/><br/>But whether regarded as an act of strict ownership or not, it appears to be expressly and specially authorized by the clause conferring the power to  \"exact the payment\" of sums of money  \"by legal means.\" This must mean the power to exact the payment of debts due the concern by means of the institution of suits for their recovery. If there could be any doubt as to the meaning of this language taken by itself, it would be removed by a consideration of the general scope and purpose of the instrument in which it occurs. (See Civil Code, art. 1286.) The main object of the instrument is clearly to make Kammerzell the manager of the Manila branch of the plaintiff’s business, with the same general authority with reference to its conduct which his principal would himself possess if he were personally directing it. It can not be reasonably supposed, in the absence of very clear language to that effect, that it was the intention of the principal to withhold from his agent a power so essential to the efficient management of the business entrusted to his control as that to sue for the collection of debts. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The accused has been charged with the crime of falsifying a private document, prohibited and penalized in article 304 of the Penal Code. During the months of May and June, 1900, the accused was the agent in Vigan of the Philippine Commercial Company. On three distinct occasions during these months the accused executed receipts in which he made it appear that Isabelo Feril had received the total sum of 485 pesos from the Philippine Commercial Company on account of the sale of 100 picos of maguey (agave). These receipts were signed by the accused with the name of Isabelo Feril. He likewise made entries in the books of the company on the corresponding dates, evidencing the payment of such sums to Isabelo Feril. Isabelo feril testifies that the receipts were false. The accused admitted the truth of this statement and that he had never paid Isabelo Feril any sum of money whatever; and that he had never had a contract with the latter for the purchase of maguey. <br/><br/>A comparison of the signature upon the three receipts with the genuine signature of Isabelo Feril which appears in the record discloses that the accused made no attempt to imitate the signature of the aforesaid Feril. No similarity exists between the fictitious and the authentic signature. Isabelo Feril testifies that the false signature in no way resembles his own. <br/><br/>Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that the accused can not be convicted of a violation of article 304. This article is related to article 300. <br/><br/>The sole paragraph of this last-mentioned article that could be applied to the present case is No. 1, which employs the words  \"contrahaciendo o fingiendo\" a letter, signature, or mark. The following definition of the word  \"contrahacer\" is found in the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy:  \"Hacer una cosa tan parecida a otra que con dificultad se distingan\" (\"to make a thing of such close resemblance to another that it is distinguished only with difficulty\"), and this definition of the word  \"fingir\" :  \"Contrahacer alguna cosa dandola la semejanza de lo que no es\" (\"to counterfeit something, giving it the appearance of that which it is not\"). The use of these two words indicates that the mere drawing up of a false document is not sufficient to constitute the crime in question. The signing of a private document in the name of another person without authority to do so can not be held to be a crime according to article 304. It is necessary that an attempt be made to imitate the writing, signature, or mark of the person whose name is signed. <br/><br/>The supreme court of Spain has so decided in several successive decisions. Among others there may be cited that of April 15, 1885, a case very similar in its facts to the present one; so also the decision of December 27, 1882. <br/><br/>The judgment therefore should be reversed and the defendant acquitted with costs, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">There was but little dispute over the facts in this case. Ira Van Camp was employed by the Pacific Oriental Trading Company in the month of May, 1901. On the 28th of that month the manager of the company gave him orders to go to Tarlac to collect a sum of money which was owing to the company from one Buford and to return that night. The accused did as ordered, receiving from Buford 1,900 pesos, which he brought with him to Manila, where he arrived at 7:30 p.m. There was no person present at the offices of the company when he arrived other than Mr. Rogers, to whom the accused delivered 1,600 pesos, stating that he had collected the same from Buford. The following day the accused went to the office and saw that the 1,600 pesos were delivered to the cashier and credited to the account of Buford, giving to the cashier an order of Buford’s for a new invoice of merchandise which the company refused to fulfill on the ground that Buford had not paid more than 1,600 pesos. <br/><br/>We are of the opinion that it clearly appears from the proofs adduced that the accused never stated on any of the occasions when speaking to the persons connected with the company that the sum collected from Buford was 1,900 pesos and not 1,600 pesos, although he did state to the cashier that within a few days he would pay in $150, gold, to be placed to the credit of Buford. This was when they had already refused to make further sales to Buford on credit. On the 29th, as Ira Van Camp contends, but, according to the cashier, on the 31st, the accused asked how much he had to his credit by way of salary and reimbursement of expenses and he was informed that the sum amounted to 167 pesos. He then paid the cashier 33 pesos and told him to place the sum of 200 pesos to the credit of Buford, which was done. <br/><br/>The accused testified that he brought with him to Manila the 1,900 pesos and that he could not pay the balance of 300 pesos the following day for the reason that he did not have the sum. He testified that he used these 300 pesos because he believed that the balance owing to him from the company amounted to that sum. We can not credit this statement. The salary which the accused received was 250 pesos per month and 2-1/2 pesos daily for payment of expenses. He had collected all that was due him up to May 1. During the month of May he had collected 98 pesos in Calumpit which he had applied to the payment of his expenses at the request of the assistant bookkeeper, according to the contention of the accused. During the month of May he had collected 25 pesos on account of his salary. Under these circumstances he should have known that he could not have to his credit a sum equivalent to the 300 pesos which he retained. <br/><br/>The facts which appear in this case constitute the crime of embezzlement, prohibited and punished by article 535, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code. It is not necessary to determine whether the amount appropriated was 100 or 300 pesos, since the penalty is the same in either case. The determination of this point would depend, perhaps, upon the question whether the payment of the 33 pesos and the transfer of this sum and the other 167 pesos from the account of Van Camp to that of Buford took place on the 29th or the 31st. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance considered that the last paragraph of article 535 modifies the entire article and not only paragraph 9 thereof; therefore the judge imposed a fine of 400 pesos. We consider that in this the court committed an error. It appears from an examination of the Penal Code of 1850 that article 535 of the prevailing Penal Code is composed of four of the articles of the former Code. Subdivision 9 of article 535, together with the paragraph referred to, is found in the former Code as a separate article under No. 453. We can not hold from the mere union of these articles that it has been the intention of those charged with the compilation of the Code to make this paragraph, which formerly modified article 453 only, a modification likewise of the other three articles. By its very import it can not be applicable to some of the numbers of the existing article, such for example as Nos. 7 and 8. The crimes referred to in those numbers can not exist without deceit. In all cases where the same numbers may be applicable it is indispensable that there be present an intention to defraud, and in the absence of such there can not be a conviction thereunder. That portion of the sentence therefore must be reversed. The penalty applicable to the crime of embezzlement when the amount appropriated exceeds 250 pesetas and does not exceed 6,250 pesetas is that of arresto mayor in its medium degree to prision correccional in its minimum degree. We assign as the penalty which must be imposed upon the accused that of four months and one day of arresto mayor instead of the penalty imposed by the Court of First Instance. In this respect the sentence of the Court of First Instance is reversed but affirmed in all other respects. The cause is remanded to the trial court for the purposes necessary in accordance with law, with costs on appeal. <br/><br/>It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The present appeal has been interposed in the declarative action of greater import filed in the Court of First Instance of Tondo, commenced on January 10, 1900, by Don Manuel Garcia Gavieres as plaintiff and successor in interest of the deceased Doña Ignacia de Gorricho against Doña Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera as universal heir of the deceased Don Felix Pardo de Tavera for the collection of a balance of 1,423 pesos 75 cents, remaining due on an original obligation of 3,000 pesos which, as the plaintiff alleges, was the amount of a deposit delivered by Doña Ignacia Gorricho, deceased, to Don Felix Pardo de Tavera, deceased, on the 31st day of October, 1859. The agreement between the parties appears in the following writing:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Received of Señorita Ignacia de Gorricho the sum of 3,000 pesos, gold (3,000 pesos), as a deposit payable on two months’ notice in advance, with interest at 6 per cent per annum with an hypothecation of the goods now owned by me or which may be owned hereafter, as security of the payment. <br/><br/>In witness whereof I sign in Binondo, January 31, 1859. <br/><br/>\"FELIX PARDO DE TAVERA.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant answering complaint of plaintiff alleges among other things as a defense, that the document upon which the complaint is based was not a contract of deposit as alleged in the complaint, but a contract of loan, and setting forth furthermore the payment of the original obligation as well as the prescription of the action. The defendant contends that the document upon which the action is based is not evidence of a deposit, as the plaintiff maintains, but of a contract of loan, and that the prescription applicable to loans has extinguished the right of action. Although in the document in question a deposit is spoken of, nevertheless from an examination of the entire document it clearly appears that the contract was a loan and that such was the intention of the parties. It is unnecessary to recur to the canons of interpretation to arrive at this conclusion. The obligation of the depositary to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent to the depositor suffices to cause the obligation to be considered as a loan and makes it likewise evident that it was the intention of the parties that the depositary should have the right to make use of the amount deposited, since it was stipulated that the amount could be collected after notice of two months in advance. Such being the case, the contract lost the character of a deposit and acquired that of a loan. (Art. 1768, Civil Code.) <br/><br/>All personal actions, such as those which arise from a contract of loan, cease to have legal effect after twenty years according to the Civil Code now in force. The date of the document is January 31, 1859. The proof of payment in support of the defense we consider likewise sufficient to establish such defense. The document dated January 8, 1869, executed by Don Felix Garcia Gavieres, husband and legal representative of Doña Ignacia Gorricho, acknowledges the receipt of 1,224 pesos from Don Manuel Darvin, representative of the deceased Don Felix Pardo de Tavera. This sum is declared in said document to be the balance due upon the debt of 2,000 pesos. This was slightly more or less the amount which remained as due upon the original obligation after deducting the payments which are admitted to have been made. In the absence of evidence disclosing that there were other claims in favor of Gavieres it is reasonably to be supposed that this payment was made to satisfy the balance due upon the original obligation. <br/><br/>The original contract between the parties was celebrated nearly a half century ago; the contracting parties have ceased to exist long since; it may be that there exists or may have existed documents proving a total payment between the parties and that this document has some time ago suffered the common fate of perishable things. He who by laches in the exercise of his rights has caused a failure of proof has no right to complain if the court does not apply the strict rules of evidence which are applicable in ordinary cases, and admits to a certain extent the presumption to which the conduct of the interested party himself naturally gives rise. <br/><br/>It is our opinion that the judgment of the Court of First Instance should be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with costs of appeal taxed against the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Shortly after 8 o’clock in the evening of October 23, 1900, six unknown persons presented themselves in the immediate vicinity of the house of Pedro Pascua, situated in the pueblo of Santa Maria, Province of Ilocos Sur. One of these ordered that the man within the house come down, and as Pascua did not do so because of his fear, one of the unknown, who was recognized and proved later to be the accused, Cayetano Abalos, went up into the house. There the accused, without any apparent motive, struck Pascua repeated blows with a dagger, inflicting upon him five wounds, two of which, in the left side of the chest and in the abdomen, were serious and dangerous according to the medical practitioner who examined him. The patient was cured in thirty — one days, with the result that an opening remained in the abdominal region which produced a hernia which exposed the patient to grave accidents. Notwithstanding the fact that the aggressor set out to escape immediately after committing the assault, the wife and daughter of the wounded person, as well as he himself, were able to recognize him. <br/><br/>The facts related appear duly proved in the action as well as the guilt of the accused, Cayetano Abalos, fully convicted as principal by direct participation of the crime of assault of grave character on the person of Pedro Pascua. Although the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge of the crime imputed to him, his guilt is established by the testimony of two eyewitnesses who confirm the accusation and, together with the person attacked, recognized the accused at the time of the assault; by the statements of three neighbors who were attracted by the cries of the wife of the complainant and who were then informed of what had taken place and of the fact that the attacking person was Cayetano Abalos; by the inexplicable absence and disappearance of the accused from his house since the date of the occurrence, without having appeared in spite of judical citations until he was arested on April 3 of this year. This absence is proved by the answers given by the justices of the peace of the districts of Ilocos Sur and Union and by the local president of Narvacan, which contradict and destroy the proof of an alibi attempted by the defendant. It is also to be noted that whereas the wife and daughter of the accused assert this alibi two other witnesses whom he had also cited testified that Cayetano Abalos absented himself from his house, going, according to one of them, to the town of San Jose de Abra. <br/><br/>There should be considered in the perpetration of the crime the concurrence of the aggravating circumstances Nos. 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Code, since the defendant committed the same by availing himself of the darkness and silence of the night, attacking the complainant in his own house without the latter’s having provoked or given reason for the deed. Owing to the nature of the crime the mitigating circumstance provided in article 11 should not be considered, nor should any other extenuating circumstances be deemed present. Since on account of the consequences produced by the wound of the abdomen, the deed must be classed as constituting a grave assault (lesion grave) included in article 416, No. 3, of the Penal Code, it follows that the accused has incurred the penalty prescribed in the aforesaid article and number in the maximum degree. <br/><br/>In this court the Solicitor-General asks that the final judgment of the Court of First Instance be annulled on the ground that the same was pronounced after the 16th day of June last, from which he infers that it was rendered by one who was not a judge. <br/><br/>By article 65 of the law organizing courts of justice for the Philippine Islands, No. 136 of those promulgated by the legislative commission, the Courts of First Instance which then existed became extinguished by the substitution of those which that same act created. The latter was passed the 11th day of June, of the present year and went into effect on the 16th day of the same month. (Art. 92.) <br/><br/>Consequently the said judges should have ceased to act on the 16th, the day on which the new organic law commenced to operate, but in fact almost all of them continued exercising their functions until the newly appointed judges arrived to take charge. The reason for this continuation was, as to some, due to ignorance of the new organization, and as to others, the circumstance that, under previous laws which controlled the commencement and the termination of the jurisdiction which they exercised, certain prior acts were necessary without which they would have incurred criminal responsibility, such as might have been incurred in the present case for abandonment of their public functions to the injury of the public, which would have been without an administration of justice during the days that elapsed until the new judges assumed charge. As to the public there was nothing to induce a contrary belief, that is, that certain judges whom the public was accustomed to recognize as true and legitimate judges were incompetent. <br/><br/>Therefore they were judges of the new courts de facto and in good faith. No usurpation of jurisdiction can be imputed to them. As such judges they were accepted by common error. <br/><br/>It is a universally professed doctrine that the acts of judges, considered such by common error, whether there be color of title or not (as in this case there was), are valid and effective in favor of the public welfare. This, according to the phrase of one law, is the most humane course, one which can injure no one, and brings no discredit upon the administration of justice. On the other hand much harm would result to the prejudice of the public, wholly free from blame and unchargeable with any responsibility, if by the rigor of the law such acts must be declared null, solely upon the ground that the judges were, according to the intent of the legislator, to cease to be such after the 16th of June last. <br/><br/>In the American law there can be cited the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Norton v. Shelby County (118 U. S., 425, 445, 446). <br/><br/>In the Spanish law, law 4, title 4 of the third Partida, in which is reproduced the famous law of Barbarius Philippus of the Roman Digest, treats of the acts of a slave who had been invested with judicial authority, it not being known that he was in slavery; in such case as this, declares the law,  \"the judgments and the orders and all other things done in virtue of his office, until the day it was discovered he was a slave, would be valid. And this the ancient sages thought just, because when a whole people commit an error it should be overlooked by all of them, as though it had never happened.\" The fifth law, first title of Book XI, of the Novisima Recopilacion, concerning this same case, declares  \"that the judgments and orders and all other things done in virtue of his office as judge were valid up to the day he was discovered to be a slave since by common opinion he was regarded as free.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>For these reasons we decide that the judgment here alleged to be null should not be so declared. <br/><br/>For the foregoing considerations it is proper that Cayetano Abalos be sentenced to the penalty of four years of prision correccional together with the accessory penalties prescribed in article 61 of the Code and to indemnify the injured party in the sum of 100 pesos and in the event of insolvency to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment; and to the payment of the costs in both instances. In the penalty imposed there is not to be computed the provisional imprisonment of the defendant for the reason that he is within the exception provided in No. 3 of the ninety-third rule of the provisional law for the application of the Penal Code. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed in so far as the same is in accord with the foregoing opinion and reversed in so far as it is not so.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In the action of greater import to annul the will of Doña Juana Espinosa, the appellant represented the plaintiff. That the plaintiff was Don Eulalio Hernaez and none other appears from the power of attorney for the purposes of litigation which accompanies the complaint as well as from the text of the complaint itself; that said action was not commenced in his name by virtue of an agreement with the remaining heirs appears in the complaint. In that complaint the plaintiff prays the court that the remaining heirs be required to declare whether or not they conform to the complaint. Four of the heirs having been cited for the purpose proposed by the plaintiff, they declared that they were not in conformity with the complaint, manifesting in a conclusive manner that they did not make themselves responsible for the expenses which the said action might occasion. The facts related disclose that there was no contract, express or implied, between the appellant and any of the heirs with the exception of Don Eulalio which could make the said heirs individually responsible for the payment of the fees earned by the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>The appellant contends, nevertheless, that the estate is responsible for the payment of said fees. We can not admit this contention. The action in question was commenced by Don Eulalio personally. The duties of the executor did not require that he avail himself of the services of an attorney such as the present appellant, and it would be difficult to explain how an executor could legally employ an attorney to litigate concerning the validity of the very will of which he is the executor. The heirs have the right to litigate if they deem it expedient to do so, but this would be in their personal capacity, and for the payment of the costs which arise therefrom the estate can not enter into contracts either express or implied. The fact, if such it may be considered, that the prior administrator or executor had paid a part of the fees is of no importance, and said act being illegal of itself it does not authorize the succeeding administrator to continue making such payments. <br/><br/>The true grounds upon which, in our opinion, the appellant stands are that his services have resulted beneficially to the heirs and that therefore they should compensate him for his labor. There has not been cited to us, neither do we know of, a provision of the law in support of this contention. If we were to admit this contention the theory of the law would be completely changed. There would be no further need of contracts. It would result that anyone might impose obligations upon another without his knowledge or consent, and even against his protest as happened in the present case. <br/><br/>The order appealed from is affirmed with costs taxed against the <em>Appellant</em>.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff obtained a preliminary attachment, presenting for that purpose a document in which it appears that a debt exists in his favor from the defendants. In the complaint filed later in accordance with article 1393 of the Law of Civil Procedure he did not seek to collect the debt but prayed for the rescission of the contract of sale from which the debt had arisen. The court below dissolved the preliminary attachment. The question which must be resolved is the following: What is the nature of the complaint which must be filed in conformity with the said article 1393? We are of the opinion that it should be a complaint for the collection of the debt and not one for the rescission of the contract. The article which confers upon the Courts of First Instance the authority to order preliminary attachments says that this may be done when it is sought to secure the payment of a debt. (Art. 1379.) Justices of the peace, according to the same article, can order a preliminary attachment if requested at the time of filing a complaint in which the payment of a debt is sought. The same article which confers such authority apparently limits its exercise to actions dealing with the collection of a debt. <br/><br/>To secure the attachment the moving party must present a document which discloses the existence of the debt. (Art. 1382.) In an action for the rescission of a contract the case may be, and most frequently is, that there is no debt. <br/><br/>No attachment can be put into effect if in making of the levy the person against whom it is ordered pays the sums which are claimed. (Art. 1387.) In an action for rescission how is this amount to be determined, and in such action what right has the defendant to make any such payment?<br/><br/>In an action to rescind a sale the sole object which the plaintiff seeks is the possession of the thing sold; but if he should be entitled to an attachment in such an action then it could not be limited to the thing sold but might be extended to all of the property of the defendant, both real and personal. <br/><br/>In actions which concern the ownership of certain classes of property, section 2 of Title XIV gives to the plaintiff the right to ask for the judicial administration or receivership of the property during the pendency of the litigation. We are not aware of the existence of any other law under which the plaintiff in an action for rescission has the right to ask that the property in litigation be placed in the custody of the court in which the action is being tried during the pendency thereof. <br/><br/>The plaintiff not having presented a complaint for the collection of a debt, the order of the trial court is in accordance with law and is hereby affirmed with costs taxed against the <em>Appellant</em>.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">At the former hearing of this cause before the old Supreme Court certain objections were made concerning the sufficiency of the complaint filed, which objections are in some respects the same which the attorney for the defense now presents. This court annulled the judgment of conviction dictated in the cause, remanding the same to the lower court for a new trial. The court must have deemed the said complaint sufficient, since it would otherwise have ordered the filing of a new complaint. This decision of the question is therefore res adjudicata. <br/><br/>Since the order dictated by this court vacated only the proceedings held by the trial court commencing with the introduction of the evidence, the formal arraignment remained in full force, and therefore in holding the new trial there was no necessity for requiring the appearance anew of the accused to plead guilty or not guilty. <br/><br/>The accused were not compelled but merely permitted to testify before the taking of the evidence offered on the part of the Government. This was an irregularity but did not prejudice the essential rights of the accused, and therefore, in view of the provisions of Article 10 of General Orders, No. 58, is not sufficient to warrant the annulling of the sentence. <br/><br/>The three elements which are necessary in order that there may be a conviction of the crime of rape, according to the attorney for the defense, are all included in this one word. When a woman testifies that she has been raped she sats, in effect, that all that is necessary to constitute the commission of this crime has been committed. It is merely a question then, whether or not this court accepts her statement. It can not be said that the proofs are lacking of the existence of the elements which together constitute the crime. In the present case we are convinced that the woman stated the truth, and we believe Ramos to be guilty of the crime with which he is charged. <br/><br/>With respect to Torre we have arrived at the conclusion that he should be acquitted. He did not rape the woman. When the two unknown persons presented themselves he ran away. It is true that the witnesses for the prosecution stated that he arrived at the house with Ramos, but there is no proof that he had knowledge of any intention then entertained by Ramos to rape the woman nor can we see how Torre in any manner has lent his aid knowingly to the commission of the crime. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed in all its parts in so far as affects the defendant Ramos and reversed as to defendant Torre. The latter is acquitted of the crime of which he is accused. <br/><br/>Affirming that portion of the sentence consulted which is in conformity with this decision and reversing the remaining portion, with one-half of the costs incurred in this action taxed against the defendant Ramos and the remaining one-half taxed de oficio, the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the evening of the 25th of October, 1899, while Andres Opao, the vice-president, was inspecting the barrio of Dos Hermanas of the pueblo of Talisay, in order to ascertain whether its residents Hermanas of the pueblo of Talisay, in order to ascertain whether its residents were complying with the order to place lights in front of their houses, he noted that Licerio Abijan, one of them, had not placed a light in front of his house. Therefore, since he failed to present himself when called twice through the medium of the deputy, Eugenio Arca, that officer stationed himself in the neighborhood of Abijan’s house. The latter, having been called anew, descended and was taken to task for his failure to comply with the order. He then heard Opao order his arrest, and thereupon assaulted Opao, inflicting upon him a mortal wound in the left groin and another light one on the palm of the hand. The defendant fled immediately. Opao died as a result of the would in the groin, according to the medical report. <br/><br/>The accused confessed having attacked the deceased, for the reason that the latter (because of his failure to have a light in the window of his house as was ordered) called him out and on his descending took him to task with harsh words and struck him with a cane. He received the blow on his hand in attempting to ward it off and the intense pain he suffered in his little finger blinded him, and, drawing the dagger which he carried in his belt, he assaulted Andres Opao with it and then set out to run. <br/><br/>These facts, proved in the cause by ocular inspection, expert testimony, the declarations of credible witnesses, and by the confession of the accused, constitute the compound crime of attack upon an agent of the Government and homicide — included in articles 249, 250, and 404 in relation with article 89 of the Penal Code — in that the defendant without legal reason or justifiable motive assaulted with a dagger the local president of the barrio of Dos Hermanas while the latter was in the discharge of his duties as a representative of the Government; and in consequence of the mortal wound which he inflicted in the left groin the said president died a few moments later. The excuse alleged by the defendant can not be entertained for failure of proof thereof since it is not confirmed by the only witness who was present, Eugenio Arca. The order of arrest given by the deceased, for the violation of an ordinance committed by the accused, furnishes neither cause nor reason for the latter to have made a fatal assault with a deadly weapon upon the said representative of the Government. <br/><br/>For these reasons it is not proper to consider the extenuating circumstances fourth and seventh of article 9 applied by the Superior Court of Negros, nor the intoxication of the accused, for the reason that such state was habitual to him; but there should be considered the aggravating circumstance No. 24 of article 10 of the Code, since the crime was committed by making use of arms prohibited by the regulations. This circumstance is offset, however, by the mitigating circumstance established by article 11 of the Code, and therefore, according to article 89 above cited, the accused has incurred the penalty for the crime of homicide applied in the medium grade of its maximum degree. <br/><br/>Furthermore, this court is fully authorized to increase the penalty and apply the proper provisions of the penal law, since the right of appeal exercised by the accused confers upon the court full jurisdiction and renders it competent to examine the record and revise the judgment appealed from. <br/><br/>In virtue, therefore, of the considerations above set forth, it is just and proper that the judgment rendered by the Superior Court of the Island of Negros be reversed, and that Licerio Abijan be condemned to the penalty of eighteen years two months and twenty-one days of reclusion temporal as the perpetrator of the compound crime of attack upon an officer of the Government with homicide, to the accessory punishments provided in article 59 of the Code, to the payment of an indemnity of 1,000 pesos, Mexican, to the widow and heirs of the deceased, and to the payment of the costs in both instances. <br/><br/>It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On a certain day in the month of May, 1899 (the exact date does not appear), the accused, Sixto Arribas, met Victoriano Añon walking upon the highroad of the barrio of Pongol, in the capital of Ilocos Sur Province, in company with Tiburcio Alcante, Urbano Alnairo, Geronimo Arruisa, and Hilario Arribas. Añon, upon noting the presence of Arribas, ran away, whereupon the latter pursued him, bolo in hand. Upon overtaking Añon in a lot in which he had taken refuge he assaulted him, inflicting several wounds, some of them necessarily fatal, according to the medical report, and from which Añon then and there died. His companions, following him to the lot to see what was taking place, found him a corpse, covered with wounds, but did not find the accused, whom they supposed to be the author of his death, at the place of the assault. <br/><br/>These facts, fully proven in the case by ocular inspection, expert testimony, authentic documents, and the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, constitute the crime of homicide, penalized in article 404 of the Penal Code, for the reason that the wounds of Victoriano Añon were the immediate cause of his death. <br/><br/>Although the accused did not plead guilty of the homicide in question, it is altogether beyond doubt that Sixto Arribas was the sole confessed and convicted author by direct participation of the violent death of said Añon. This is verified not only by his own statement that he had pursued the deceased and assaulted him with the bolo which he carried, but also by the testimony of three witnesses who witnessed the pursuit which preceded the assault and who later saw the corpse of the deceased with several wounds, so that the witnesses believed that Arribas and no other was the aggressor and the author of the death of the deceased Añon. <br/><br/>In the commission of this crime there is to be considered the circumstance provided for in article 11 of the Code and the extenuating circumstances 5 and 7 of article 9 of the Code, since it is an established fact that the deceased attempted to rape the wife of the accused, Perpetua Quejismundo, and on being surprised leaped through the window of the house and fled, all of which is confirmed by three witnesses who had knowledge of the facts, one of whom having heard the cries of the wife of the defendant appealing for help. The conduct of the deceased, who fled at sight of the accused, is also significant as tending to show that he had committed some grave offense against the latter. Although there is no proof of the second attempted assault upon his wife, alleged by the prisoner in his defense, to justify the attack made upon the deceased, it is altogether incontrovertible, judging from the merits of the record, that the defendant attacked and killed Victoriano Añon to vindicate a grave offense to his honor and that of his wife, and was impelled to the commission of the crime by the powerful passion of jealousy, and thus acted while under the influence of passion and obfuscation. There being no aggravating circumstances, and the two mitigating circumstances mentioned being present in a marked degree, rule 5 of article 81 of the Code is to be applied by imposing upon the accused the minimum grade of prision mayor, the penalty next below that assigned in article 404 of the Code. <br/><br/>Therefore, the judgment reviewed should be affirmed in all respects with the costs of appeal taxed against appellant, and with approval of the order dictated in the incident of attachment, declaring defendant insolvent. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The cession of the Philippine Archipelago having been agreed upon by the parties to the treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898, the compulsory subjection of the subjects of the ceding power to the new sovereign followed as a logical consequence. The status of these subjects was not uniform, as in addition to the natives there were others who were merely residents but who, equally with the natives, had interests and rights inherent in the nationality of the territory. With respect to these the special agreement contained in article 9 was established, by virtue of which it was agreed to accord them the right of electing to leave the country, thus freeing themselves of subjection to the new sovereign, or to continue to reside in the territory, in which case the expiration of the term of eighteen months without their making an express declaration of intention to retain their Spanish nationality resulted in the loss of the latter, such persons thereby becoming subjects of the new sovereign in the same manner as the natives of these Islands. The period of eighteen months began to run from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty — that is to say, from April 11, 1899, and expired on the corresponding day of October, 1900. The petitioner absented himself from these Islands on May 30, 1899, and remained absent therefrom during the whole period. It was in January, 1901, that he returned to these Islands. <br/><br/>From this conduct on the part of the petitioner it is evident that he elected to take the first of the two courses open to him under his right of option. Neither the Government nor the courts can place any other construction upon the facts above related. Having left the Islands he had no occasion to make any declaration of his intention to preserve his Spanish nationality, which he carried with him on his departure. This nationality could be forfeited only by a continued residence in the ceded territory and a failure to make a declaration of intention to preserve it within the term fixed therefor. The conditions which gave rise to the presumptive change of nationality were residence and the lapse of eighteen months without express declaration to the contrary; these two conditions not being fulfilled there was no change of national status. Neither by the Government of Spain nor by that of the United States could the petitioner be regarded as a Filipino subject. By absenting himself from the territory he continued to be a Spaniard. <br/><br/>To native-born subjects of the territory no such right of option was accorded; it was expressly refused them upon the rejection by the American Commissioners of the proposition in favor of the inhabitants of the ceded territories made by the Spanish Commissioners in Annex No. 1 to the twenty-second protocol. (Conference of December 10, 1898.) The native subject could not evade the power of the new sovereign by withdrawing from the Islands, nor while continuing to reside therein make declaration of his intention to preserve the Spanish nationality enjoyed under the former sovereign. Neither the Government of the United States nor that of Spain can donsider them as other than Filipino subjects. This is expressly stated by the Spanish Government in article 1 of its royal decree of May 11, 1901. <br/><br/>The dates fixed by the treaty by which the sovereignty of one nation is ceded to another are of the highest importance, they being part of the contract, and are not within the control of the subjects as are those relating to their individual rights by reason of the fact that the political rights of the contracting nations themselves are the subject of the agreement. It is for this reason that the Government of Spain in the royal decree above cited has always taken the dates fixed in the treaty of Paris as the starting point, and, moreover, expressly declares therein that persons who are natives or residents of the ceded or relinquished territories can not, in their relations with the Government or authorities of such territories, lay claim to Spanish nationality preserved or recovered by virtue of said decree, except with the consent of such Government, or under treaty stipulations. (Art. 5.) The Government and courts of these Islands should not act with less circumspection in the matter, and invade the sovereign rights of Spain by giving the presumptive nationality established by Article IX of the treaty of Paris an extent not warranted by the conditions upon which it depends, to wit, residence coupled with failure to make an express declaration to the contrary. The ordinary provisions of local laws in their normal operation with regard to the effect of absence upon the retention of a residence or domicile can not therefore be relied upon, nor the presumption as to the intention of an absentee recognized by civil codes and international treaties, although the most general and almost the only proof allowed by statute as evidence of an intention to preserve a residence or domicile in a country is the maintenance of a dwelling or commercial establishment therein, upon which point, as also upon the fact that the petitioner became a member of the bar of Barcelona upon his arrival in that city, we make no decision, not regarding it as of any moment in view of the conclusions above expressed. The fact is that one is not to be regarded as having submitted to the new sovereign by the mere failure to make an express declaration, inasmuch as without a residence de facto the declaration is of no significance, having been established for the express purpose of overcoming the effect of a continued residence, an act which in itself implies subjection to the new sovereign by giving rise to the presumption of waiver of Spanish nationality and the adoption of that of the territory. <br/><br/>The petitioner can not, therefore, be considered to have lost his Spanish nationality by reason of his residence in the territory after the 11th of October, 1900, and his failure to make declaration of his intention to preserve it within the period agreed upon by the high contracting parties to the treaty of Paris, and to have adopted the nationality of the native subjects under the presumption arising from the conditions expressed. He can only acquire it through voluntary renunciation of his present nationality by seeking to become naturalized in these Islands; but upon this matter this court can decide nothing, there having been no legislation upon the subject up to the present. <br/><br/>The status of the petitioner with respect to the new sovereignty of the territory having been defined, it remains to determine the question raised as to whether Spanish subjects resident therein constitute an intermediate class between other foreign residents and the natives of the country in whose behalf some specially favorable conditions have been stipulated. Upon this point no proposition was made, even incidentally, nor was any reference made to it in the discussions which preceded the treaty of Paris. The American Commissioners, referring to Spanish subjects, natives of Spain, simply said:  \"Such persons have the fullest right to dispose of their property and remove from the territory or remain therein to continue to be Spanish subjects or elect the nationality of the new territory.\" (Memorandum annexed to Protocol No. 22.)  \"They shall also have the right to carry on their industry, commerce, and profession, being subject in respect thereof to such laws as are applicable to other foreigners.\" (Art. 9 of the treaty of Paris.) The laws applicable to other foreigners were, prior to that treaty, the Law of Foreigners for the Ultramarine Provinces of July 4, 1870, and article 27 of the Civil Code. The first of these laws in its thirty-ninth article authorized all foreigners to engage in any kind of industry in the Spanish ultramarine provinces subject to the laws prevailing therein, and to practice any profession for which the laws did not require a diploma of proficiency granted by the Spanish authorities. No one can doubt that the legal profession is one of those for the practice of which the law required a diploma of proficiency granted by the Spanish authorities. The second law cited provides that foreigners in Spain shall enjoy the rights which the civil laws accord to Spaniards, subject to the provisions of article 2 of the constitution of the State. Article 2 of the constitution of 1876 establishes the same restriction or limitation as the law of foreigners. Hence if other foreigners could not then engage in the practice of law, and by the express prohibition of the Code of Civil Procedure in force can not do so at the present time, neither can Spanish subjects do so, they being in every respect upont he same footing as other foreigners. <br/><br/>If, then, the petitioner upon his departure from these Islands on May 30, 1899, did not take with him the nationality of the native inhabitants impressed by the treaty of Paris, which had been in force from the 11th of April of the same year; if he departed as a Spaniard and continued to be a Spaniard, by taking the first course left open by the right of option stipulated in the treaty of Paris, without being affected by the presumptive nationality of the territory arising from the fact of residence and the lapse of the time fixed; if he had not elected to adopt this nationality of the territory by express declaration within the same period; if after the expiration of that period it is expressly provided that the right of option shall no longer be available, and that the only course is naturalization, as to which there has been no legislative enactment; if as a Spanish subject upon equal footing with other foreign residents he can not practice the legal profession under the law either prior or subsequent to the treaty of Paris, it is evident that this court can not regard the petitioner as possessed of the qualifications alleged. <br/><br/>The new petition presented by him for admission to the bar of these Islands must therefore be denied, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The 15th day of October, 1901, Act 265 of the Legislative Commission of the Philippines was promulgated; about the 23d of November following a British subject, Thomas Toye Patterson, arrived at the port of Manila from abroad on board the steamer Yuensang. It appeared in the course of these proceedings that Patterson was a justice of the peace under the Australian Government, and had not lost his official character notwithstanding his residence of ten months in the United States, from whence he had gone to the British colony of Hongkong, and from the latter point proceeded to the port of Manila. Upon being arrested by the Collector of Customs of the Philippine Archipelago twenty-four hours after landing he sued out a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, the object of the present decision, to which Mr. W. Morgan Shuster, as such Collector of Customs of the Philippine Archipelago, made return that he had arrested said Patterson because he had reasonable grounds to believe him guilty of some or all of the offenses specified in said law. <br/><br/>Without any intention to prejudge the question, and acting solely upon its desire to permit the most ample discussion after its resolution of the 7th of December the court resolved to allow evidence to be taken in this case, and with this same object in view did not limit any proof whatever which the parties might desire to offer nor bar any allegation upon the question which it pleased them to raise concerning the exclusive competency of that administrative officer in the application of Act 265, the jurisdiction of this court to review a decision of such officer, the nature of the law, its true object and scope, and the authority of the Legislative Commission to pass such a law. After this exhaustive discussion of the case it is now for the court to render its decision. <br/><br/>Unquestionably every State has a fundamental right to its existence and development, as also to the integrity of its territory and the exclusive and peaceable possession of its dominions which it may guard and defend by all possible means against any attack. Upon this fundamental right Act 265 of the Legislative Commission of the Philippines is based. Upon this fundamental principle are based many other laws, among them those concerning immigration, emigration, commerce, and international intercourse. But contrary to the various allegations of the parties, Act 265 is not an emigration law, because it does not purport to regulate the conditions upon which the inhabitants of the territory may leave it; nor is it an immigration law, because it is not limited to the entrance into the territory of those who are foreigners, but refers  \"to persons coming from abroad, or those who are guilty of coming to the Philippines with a certain purpose,\" without distinction of nationality; neither is it a law of commerce or international communication, because of the precise and positive character of its object, which is no other than to prevent the entrance of those persons who  \"have aided, abetted, or instigated an insurrection in these Islands against the sovereignty of the United States therein, or against the Government herein established, or such persons as come here with any of these objects.\" Consequently the arguments adduced by the parties, with citations of authorities pro or con based upon the supposition that Act 265 is an immigration law, or part of the laws of the United States upon this subject, need not occupy the attention of the court. Nor is there merit in the question raised by the petitioner when he invokes the international treaty between England and the United States — that is to say, the law governing commerce and intercourse between the subjects of both nations — because, as we believe, it is a doctrine generally professed by virtue of that fundamental right to which we have referred that under no aspect of the case does this right of intercourse give rise to any obligation on the part of the State to admit foreigners under all circumstances into its territory. The international community, as Martens says, leaves States at liberty to fix the conditions under which foreigners should be allowed to enter their territory. These conditions may be more or less convenient to foreigners, but they are a legitimate manifestation of territorial power and not contrary to law. In the same way a State possesses the right to expel from its territory any foreigner who does not conform to the provisions of the local law. (Martens’s Treatise on International Law, vol. 1, p. 381.) Superior to the law which protects personal liberty, and the agreements which exist between nations for their own interest and for the benefit of their respective subjects is the supreme and fundamental right of each State to self-preservation and the integrity of its dominion and its sovereignty. Therefore it is not strange that this right should be exercised in a sovereign manner by the executive power, to which is especially entrusted in the very nature of things the preservation of so essential a right without interference on the part of the judicial power. If it can not be denied that under normal circumstances when foreigners are present in the country the sovereign power has the right to take all necessary precautions to prevent such foreigners from imperiling the public safety, and to apply repressive measures in case they should abuse the hospitality extended them, neither can we shut our eyes to the fact that there may be danger to personal liberty and international liberty if to the executive branch of the Government there should be conceded absolutely the power to order the expulsion of foreigners by means of summary and discretional proceedings; nevertheless, the greater part of modern laws, notwithstanding these objections, have sanctioned the maxim that the expulsion of foreigners is a political measure and that the executive power may expel without appeal any person whose presence tends to disturb the public peace. The privilege of foreigners to enter the territory of a State for the purpose of traveling through or remaining therein being recognized on principle, we must also recognize the right of the State under exceptional circumstances to limit this privilege upon the ground of public policy, and in all cases preserve the obligation of the foreigner to subject himself to the provisions of the local law concerning his entry into and his presence in the territory of each State. <br/><br/>The abnormal conditions prevailing in some provinces of this new territory of the United States are known as a fact to the whole world. Act 265, as a political measure, seeks to prevent all classes of agitators, even citizens, from aggravating or extending the disturbance which still exists, much reduced, in certain parts of the Archipelago. Under these circumstances the Government exercising in a sovereign and efficacious manner this attribute of executive power has authorized an administrative officer to prevent the entrance into the country of persons from abroad whom he has reasonable grounds to believe guilty of having aided, abetted, or instigated insurrection, or whom he suspects of coming to the Philippines with that purpose. The power conferred in these terms upon this executive officer is discretional. Hence, his act is presumed to be based upon reasonable grounds for believing certain persons guilty of the acts or of an intention to commit the acts defined by the law. So the law must be understood in accordance with the principles established by the highest court of the nation in a decision rendered in the case of Nishimura Ekiu v. United States (142 U. S.) , in which Mr. Justice Gray uses the following language:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"But, on the other hand, the final determination of those facts may be entrusted by Congress to executive officers; and in such a case, as in all others, in which a statute gives a discretionary power to an officer, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, he is made the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts, and no other tribunal, unless expressly authorized by law to do so, is at liberty to examine or controvert the sufficiency of the evidence on which he acted.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Because the law has used the term  \"reasonable grounds\" it is not to be inferred that his executive officer is required to show the reason for his grounds of belief to a court of justice; what the law desires to impress upon him is the idea that he is not to proceed arbitrarily but with discretion — that is, honestly, tactfully, and prudently. <br/><br/>The exhaustive argument which the court has heard is due to its urgent desire not to consider as a proper application of the law that which is not such in reality, and that there should not result a breach of constitutional or international law; but nothing of this kind has been demonstrated in this ample and wide discussion and argument. <br/><br/>To hold that because Thomas Toye Patterson succeeded in landing when the law forbids his landing the State thereby lost its right to reembark him and deport him from the territory would be similar to saying that in case a quarantine law has prohibited the landing of a person suffering from a contagious disease should such person succeed in landing the State has lost all right of deporting him and freeing itself from the danger of contagion. <br/><br/>It has been alleged that the Legislative Commission has no power to pass such a law; but the law has been passed, and against its operation there is nothing to oppose. We know of no law violated or right infringed by the existence of a law which advances the welfare of the people, the supreme law of all affairs of life. <br/><br/>We therefore deny the application of Thomas Toye Patterson for discharge, and he will be remanded to the custody of Mr. W. Morgan Shuster, Collector of Customs of the Philippine Archipelago, with the costs to Patterson, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Torres and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Upon the return to the writ in this case the petitioner offered to prove that the Collector did not have reasonable grounds for believing that the former came within the terms of the law in question. The court held that the decision of the Collector on this point was final and could not be reviewed by any judicial tribunal. The evidence was accordingly rejected. In this ruling I did not concur. <br/><br/>I concede, so far as this petitioner is concerned, that the Commission had the power to pass a law making the decision of the Collector final. The only question is, Has it done so? The law does not say  \"if the Collector believes,\" \"if he is of the opinion,\" \"if he has evidence satisfactory to himself,\" nor does it use any similar phrase. Neither does it say in so many words that his decision shall be final as does the act of Congress of 1894 relied upon by the Attorney-General. <br/><br/>To hold that his decision is final is to strike from the law the words  \"reasonable grounds.\" This is contrary to the rule of construction, which has been carried into the Code of Civil Procedure (art. 287), that effect must be given, if possible, to all the particulars of a statute. <br/><br/>When the Commission said that the Collector must have reasonable grounds on which to act they meant that he must have grounds which were reasonable in fact. Whether they were in fact reasonable or not was not to be determined by himself. If the Commission had so intended it would have been very easy to have used language which clearly expressed that intention. To hold that the Commission by the use of these words intended simply to advise the collectors throughout the Islands to act reasonably in the exercise of their powers under the act is to impute to it the doing of a vain and useless thing. Every official is presumed to act reasonably and it is not necessary in every law to advise him to do so. Moreover, under this construction the Commission virtually says to the collectors,  \"You must act on reasonable grounds, but if you do not no one can interfere with you.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Bankrupt and insolvent laws in the United States generally provide that a preference shall be void if the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that his debtor is insolvent. It has of course always been held that the courts must decide whether or not the grounds were reasonable. So, in actions for malicious prosecution, the defendant prevails if he had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff had committed the offense on account of which he procured the arrest. The courts in this class of cases always pass upon this question of probable cause. <br/><br/>The construction which I think should be given to the law would not interfere with its operation. it provides that until there is an opportunity to deport the person detained he may be confined. The persons charged with his confinement can, while a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> is being heard, easily prevent the accomplishment of any wrongful purpose which he may have had in coming to the Islands. Neither does this construction interfere with the rule that the courts can not control the discretionary acts of an administrative officer. The whole question here is whether the act is or is not discretionary. <br/><br/>The majority of the court having taken the contrary view, however, that became the law of the case. Upon the evidence which was received and upon which the case was submitted I think that the prisoner was properly remanded. To the opinion of the Chief Justice I desire to add nothing except on the subject of the landing. The evidence showed that passengers were not allowed to leave the ship at their will after receiving a pass, but were required to go from the ship to the shore, with their baggage, in a certain launch. The baggage was not examined by the customs official until it reached the shore. It seems very clear to me that while the passengers were in this launch they and their baggage were still under the jurisdiction of the Collector, and that on the arrival of the launch at the shore he could have detained any passenger coming within the provision of the law in question. In this particular case the petitioner departed from the ship in this launch, but before it reached the landing he transferred himself from it into another craft which was brought alongside by one of his friends, and thus reached the shore. He left the launch in this way without the knowledge or consent of the Collector or any of his deputies, and having done so the mere fact that he succeeded in getting his foot on shore did not deprive the Collector of the right to detain him when on the next day he presented himself for his baggage, which all the time remained in the custody of the Collector. Where a person not entitled to land gets on shore stealthily or without the knowledge of the Collector, from the very nature of the case the right of the latter to detain him must continue for at least a reasonable time thereafter. To hold otherwise would give to the law what seems to be an absurd construction. The Commission would in effect say to the petitioner and everyone else: The Collector has the right to prevent your landing, but if you can in any way get to the shore without his knowledge you can stay there. <br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> in this case is based upon the acts of the Collector of the Customs of the Philippine Islands in the detention of the prisoner for the purpose of deporting him to Hongkong. <br/><br/>Under the provisions of Act 265 of the United States Philippine Commission, entitled  \"An act requiring persons whom the Collector of Customs has reasonable grounds for believing guilty of aiding insurrection seeking to land in the Philippines to take an oath of allegiance and prescribing punishment for the violation thereof,\" any person whom the Collector of Customs has reasonable grounds to believe guilty of having aided and abetted or incited an insurrection in these Islands against the authority and sovereignty of the United States or against the government constituted by the United States herein, or of coming to these Islands for that purpose, and who, coming from a foreign country, seeks to land at any port, shall not be permitted to land until after he shall take before the Collector of Customs or his authorized deputy the oath prescribed by the act. <br/><br/>On the 24th day of November the petitioner, Thomas Toye Patterson, a British subject, arrived at the port of Manila, from Hongkong, by the steamer Yuensang. Twenty-four hours after landing he, having been required by the Collector of Customs to take the prescribed oath and having refused to comply on account of his objections to certain parts of the oath, was arrested by the Collector of Customs and is now held by him for deportation. <br/><br/>It may be admitted that it is not within the province of the judiciary by a judgment to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized or acquired any residence in the country shall be permitted to enter in opposition to the lawful measures of the legislative and executive branches of the Government; that the question in such cases is political in its nature and belongs exclusively to the legislative or executive branches of the Government; that as to such persons the decision of an executive or administrative officer, acting within powers expressly conferred, is due process of law, and that in the absence of express authority such decision can not be reexamined by any tribunal. Still, such officer must act within the scope of his authority, otherwise he is without jurisdiction, his decision is a nullity, and the courts will relieve a person by <em>habeas corpus</em> from the unlawful imprisonment under such void proceedings. <br/><br/>The testimony of Ralph C. Dickey, Inspector of Immigration, is that he is the Inspector of Immigration for the port of Manila, that his duty as such officer is to conduct the examination of passengers on incoming steamers as to their qualifications to land under the act in question and to reject or pass all passengers on board of such vessels; that on the 24th day of November, 1901, in the discharge of his duty and for the purpose of making such examination he went aboard the steamer Yuensang when that vessel came to the harbor and conducted the examination in person; that among those examined by him was the petitioner, and as a result of such examination he decided to pass him and gave him a permit which is in form as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"UNITED STATES CUSTOM-HOUSE, MANILA, P. I.,<br/><br/>\"IMMIGRATION OFFICE. <br/><br/>\"Guards will permit bearer to leave this ship. <br/><br/>\"(Dated) ________________<br/><br/>(Signed)  \"RALPH C. DICKEY,<br/><br/>\"Inspector of Immigration. <br/><br/>\"Guards will take up this card when bearer leaves ship and return same into Immigration Office.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This witness states that under the regulations for such examination the passenger before leaving the ship gives this pass to the inspector or to the inspector’s assistant at the gangway; that such examinations are made and concluded on board the ship, and that it is not the duty of the inspector to stay there and see passengers leave the ship; that passengers leave shipboard on the Travelers’ Transport launch, a company bonded to transport passengers arriving at this harbor from incoming ships to the land. <br/><br/>By reference to Act 219 of the Philippine Commission it will be seen that the Travelers’ Transport Company was not in the service of the Collector of Customs, after bids were received, to land passengers and their baggage from incoming ships. By the provisions of section 3 it is expressly stated that nothing therein contained shall prevent the landing of passengers and baggage gratuitously, the intent of this act being to limit  \"the business of landing passengers and baggage to the persons selected in accordance with this act.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The testimony of the petitioner shows that after the ship Yuensang arrived, an examination of those aboard was made by the Inspector of Immigration; that petitioner answered the required questions and took the oath as to his baggage; that he was passed by the Inspector and a permit was issued to him, and that this permit was taken up at the gangway of the ship by the assistant inspector; that with the other passengers of the ship he left for land on board the Travelers’ Transport launch, taking with him a part of his baggage; that before this launch reached the shore a friend came alongside and took him aboard his boat, from which boat he landed in Manila. He testifies that he had no intention whatever of defeating any law by going in the boat with his friend; that he knew no order nor regulation to the contrary; that he simply went in the boat with his friend as a matter of courtesy and friendship. There is no evidence whatever in the case tending in any degree to show that the petitioner left the launch stealthily; on the contrary, the testimony is that he was subjected to and passed the only examination required by the rules and regulations of the Inspector of Customs as to his qualifications to land. <br/><br/>The petitioner was arrested twenty-four hours after landing, and the question arises whether the Collector of Customs is acting within his jurisdiction in detaining and deporting him to Hongkong. <br/><br/>Whether the case, in view of the examination made by the inspector on board the Yuensang, may be considered as one in which a decision by a competent authority has been duly made upon inquiry and investigation, and a decision reached possessing qualities of finality in the absence of provisions for opening up and reviewing the proceedings, and by which decision the jurisdiction of the officer was exhausted in the particular case, or whether it may be regarded as an attempt made by the Collector of Customs to exercise jurisdiction in a case not provided for by the act in question, which is for preventing the landing and clearly does not extend to and embrace a case in which the landing has been fully and effectually made, in either case the Collector of Customs is, in my opinion, acting without jurisdiction, and the wrongful detention under such void proceedings should be relieved against by this court. <br/><br/>It is not contended by the Attorney-General that the immigration regulations for the Philippine Islands, made by the Secretary of War on June 6, 1899, in any way affects this case. Article 4 of these regulations is cited to show that a temporary removal from the vessel should not be regarded as a landing. <br/><br/>It is expressly provided in this article  \"that whenever it shall be necessary in making the examination of immigrants to temporarily remove them from the vessel upon which they arrive to a desirable place provided for the examination, such immigrants shall not be regarded as having landed so long as they are undergoing the examination and in charge of the officer whose duty it is to make such examination, and such a removal shall not be considered a landing during the pendency of any question relating to such examination or while awaiting their return as provided by law.\" It is contended that in analogy to this regulation the petitioner’s coming ashore should not be regarded as a landing. It seems more plausible that a contrary conclusion should be drawn from this provision, as clearly showing the construction of what is regarded as a landing, and that the War Department in considering the effects of a landing has deemed it proper to define what facts shall constitute a landing. The inference is that in the absence of such regulation the landing of an immigrant or passenger not in charge of an officer whose duty it is to make such examination would be considered as a landing and deprive the officer of his power to make the examination. <br/><br/>As shown by the testimony above referred to it is clear that the examination by the inspector on board the ship was complete and no further examination was contemplated, and that the petitioner was in no way in charge of the inspector after the issuance of the permit to him. <br/><br/>The power confided by the Commission to the Collector of Customs is a limited one and of a very high and delicate nature. It is to be exercised upon sudden emergency. the Collector has no time for scrupulously weighing the evidence upon which he is to exercise the power. It is of a nature which does not require strict technical proof. An investigation according to the course of judicial proceedings is wholly impracticable. Further, the disclosure of the evidence might reveal important secrets of state which for public interest should be kept in secrecy. <br/><br/>According to the view of the majority of the court, in which, regarding the act as in the nature of an immigration law, I concur, the act gives a discretionary power to be exercised by the Collector upon his own opinion of certain facts, and constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts. The exigency necessarily results in the nature of the power itself. This view furnishes a strong reason why courts should scrutinize closely the exercise of this extraordinary power, and confine the officer to the exact limits set by statute upon his action. The act is for the purpose of preventing a landing of objectionable persons and not for the purpose of bringing to trial suspicious persons who have already landed. If those who have fairly landed or who have passed examination as to their qualifications to land, and have been adjudged by proper authority as possessing the qualifications, are twenty-four hours after such examination and landing subject to arrest and deportation, at what period of time are they to be secure from the exercise over them of this extraordinary power? The limit in my opinion is the time when they have passed the examination and have been discharged or have been permitted to leave the ship and are on land not in charge of the officer whose duty it is to make such examination. This rule is easy of application. The rule adopted by the majority of the court is uncertain and dangerous in its application. <br/><br/>I do not concur in the opinion of the court. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was on intimate terms with Marcosa Peñalosa, 18 years of age, while the latter lived at the house of her father, Gregorio Peñalosa, who is the private prosecutor in this case and who was opposed to these relations. During the afternoon of May 2, 1901, Marcosa left her house of her own free will and went to that of the defendant for the purpose of demanding from him the fulfillment of the promise of marriage which he had repeatedly made her on previous occasions. Two witnesses were present in the defendant’s house, dealing with him on business matters, when she presented herself there between 1 and 2 of that afternoon. These witnesses were informed that very afternoon that Marcosa would be married to the defendant and were asked by the latter to act as witnesses to the marriage which was celebrated the following day, May 3, as appears from the corresponding certificate which is a part of the record. <br/><br/>From these facts, which we consider sufficiently proved, it is seen that the departure of Marcosa Peñalosa from her house was, instead of a case of abduction, a real elopement carried out by her as a means for contracting marriage with the defendant against the opposition of her father, inasmuch as she acted upon her own initiative and was not seduced by the said defendant. But whether elopement or abduction, it is evident that the act was not committed with unchaste designs but with matrimonial intentions which were, indeed, well known to certain persons from the very commencement of the affair, and which were realized the following day by the marriage of the accused to the woman alleged to have been abducted. <br/><br/>The unchaste designs constitute one of the essential elements that characterize the crime of abduction, as well when committed with violence against the will of the woman as when carried out with her consent in case of her minority. This is precisely the point which constitutes one of the principal differences which distinguish this crime from crimes against personal liberty and security. If the removal of a woman from her house, although she be a virgin under the age of 23 years, is committed for the purpose of murdering her or demanding a ransom, or holding her a prisoner somewhere, it would undoubtedly constitute a crime but would by no means fall under the provisions of the sections of the Penal Code which define and punish the crime of abduction, but of other sections quite distinct, although there exists in such case the material fact of the stealing away of a woman. This consideration demonstrates that the unchaste purpose is essential in all cases to the crime of abduction, and this same conclusion is deduced from the fact that the crime is classified in the code among the crimes against chastity. Article 445 of the said Code establishes clearly and conclusively the necessity of said circumstance in order that the crime of abduction may exist, and even though section 446, invoked by the complainant as applying to the present case, in speaking of the abduction of a virgin under the age of 23 years and over 12, committed with her consent, does not make express mention of unchaste designs, the provisions of this article should be considered in connection with those of the preceding one, which requires this circumstance as indispensable and essential. Article 445 is the complement of article 446, the two forming, as they do, a part of one and the same chapter included in the title which the Code devotes to crimes against chastity. <br/><br/>In addition to this, paragraph 2 of article 448, which treats of causes for abduction, speaks only of abduction committed with unchaste designs, and the preceding interpretation is still further confirmed by article 449 in that it provides that those convicted of abduction shall be sentenced, by way of indemnity, to endow the complainant and acknowledge the offspring. This impliedly presupposes the idea of unchaste purpose in all cases of abduction, for the provisions of this article as well as in that of article 448 above-mentioned are applicable to all cases of abduction for the reason that the Code expressly declares them to be of common application to all crimes against chastity. <br/><br/>In view of the foregoing considerations we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs in this instance de oficio. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

A man who is about to marry and is ignorant of his exact age seeks and obtains a certified copy of the registry of his baptism. From this it appears that he was born twenty-one years before the 1st day of June, let us say. He marries on the 15th day of June. It develops later that the person who took the copy of the registry of baptism read July as June, and as a matter of fact the man in question did not complete his twenty-one years until the 1st day of July, fifteen days after his marriage. Can such a one be convicted of a violation of article 475? It would seem that this case is included within those of the article. he was in fact a minor when he married, and he married without the consent of his parents. It is true that so far as the parent is concerned the offense has been committed, but can the same be said with reference to the State in the absence of a voluntary violation of the law? Article 1 of the Code does not contain the words  \"with malice\" that are to be found in the Code of 1822; nevertheless Pacheco, the eminent commentator, has said that those words are included in the word  \"voluntary\" (El Codigo Penal Concordado y Comentado, Vol. I, folio 74, third edition); and he states positively that crime can not exist without intent. <br/><br/>Other commentators, without being in entire conformity with Pacheco, nevertheless are agreed up to a certain point. Groizard says:  \"Such is the general rule; so it is ordinarily.\" (Codigo Penal de 1870, Vol. I, folio 37.) Viada says that  \"in the majority of cases, in the absence of intent there has been no crime; but that there can exist in some cases the latter without the former.\" (Vol. I, Codigo Penal Reformade de 1870, folio 16.) Silvela says:  \"In effect it suffices to remember the first article, which states that where there is no intent there is no crime, . . . in order to assert without fear of mistake that in our Code the substance of a crime does not exist if there is not a deed, an act which falls within the sphere of ethics, if there is not a moral wrong.\" (Vol. 2, Derecho Penal, folio 169.) <br/><br/>The theory that the absence of the words  \"with malice\" in the prevailing Code has this effect is supported by the provisions of article 568 which says:  \"He who by reckless negligence commits an act which would constitute a grave crime if malice were present shall be punished,\" etc. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court in several successive sentences has followed the same doctrine:  \"It is indispensable that this (action) in order to constitute a crime should carry with it all the malice which the volition and intention to cause the evil which may be the object of the said crime suppose.\" (Judgment of May 31, 1882.) <br/><br/>In a cause for falsity the facts involved were that the defendant had married  \"before the municipal judge of the pueblo of Rebete without other ceremony than the simple manifestation and expression of his wishes and those of the woman Leonor with whom he married before said municipal judge; that relying upon that, on account of his ignorance and lack of instruction, on the 27th of June, 1882, and the 5th of April, 1884, in the municipal court of the pueblo of Polopos he registered as legitimate children his sons, Jose and Emilio, the offspring of the illicit union of the defendant and Leonor Gonzalez.\" For the crime of falsity committed by reckless negligence the Criminal Audiencia of Albuñol condemned the said defendant to the penalty of four months and one day of arresto mayor. The Supreme Court annulled said sentence  \"considering that whatever might be the civil effects of the registration of his three sons entered by the accused in the Civil and Parochial Registers, it can not partake of the nature of a crime for lack of the necessary element of volition or intent to offend, essential to every punishable act or omission; neither did he act with negligence.\" (Judgment of March 16, 1892.) <br/><br/>In a cause prosecuted against the Chinese Sy-Ticco and against Don Guillermo Partier, in the court of Quiapo, for falsification of trade-marks, the Criminal Chamber of the Audiencia of Manila condemned the Chinaman to two years and some months of presidio correccional, and Partier to one year and some months of similar imprisonment. A writ of error was sued out in the name of Partier. The Supreme Court annulled this sentence,  \"considering that the moral element of the crime, or, in other words, existence or nonexistence of intent and malice in the commission of an act designated and punished by the law as criminal is essentially a question of fact for the exclusive judgment and determination of the trial court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"Considering that the act charged against the accused, Guillermo Partier, of having printed in his lithographic establishment the trade-mark of the cigarette packages of the Insular factory by virtue of a supposed order of the owner of said factory, to whose injury the Chinaman Abelardo Zacarias Sy-Ticco ordered him to do the said fraudulent printing, can not be considered (from the facts declared proved in the final sentence of acquittal of the Court of First Instance, accepted in its entirety and without any addition by the Appellate Court) as constituting intentional participation or cooperation in deed of falsification and defraudation committed by the former, since it does not appear in any part of the sentence that Partier was in connivance with Sy-Ticco nor that he had any reason to suspect the true character of him who, styling himself the representative of Señor Santa Marina, the owner of the La Insular factory, gave him the order to print the trade-mark of this factory on the packages, which were to be used to hold cigarettes.\" (Judgment of December 30, 1896.) <br/><br/>The judgment of October 4, 1893, is of the same tenor. It is not necessary to hold in this action that no crime mentioned in the Code can exist without intent. It suffices for the present to decide, as we do decide, that one can not be convicted under article 475 when by reason of a mistake of fact there does not exist the intention to commit the crime. <br/><br/>It remains for us to apply this principle to the facts of the present case. The defendant has stated that she believed that she was born in 1879; that so her parents had given her to understand ever since her tenderest age; that she had not asked them concerning her age because her father had given her to so understand since her childhood. Her father was present in the court room as the complaining witness. If his daughter was deviating from the truth it would have been an easy matter for him to have testified denying the truth of what she had stated. It is evident that he was interested in the conviction of his daughter, and the fact that the complaining witness did not contradict her obliges us to accept as true the statements of the witness. Being true, they disclose that she acted under a mistake of fact; that there was no intention on her part to commit the crime provided for and punished in article 475. <br/><br/>As for the husband, it has been proved that two days before the marriage was celebrated he received a letter from the woman in which she said that she was 21 years of age. This letter the defendant showed to the clergyman who married them. The woman when the marriage ceremony was performed took an oath before the clergyman, in the presence of her husband, that she was 21 years of age. The defendant testifies that he had no suspicion that the woman was a minor. This statement has not been contradicted and we consider that it suffices to demonstrate that the defendant acted under a mistake of fact, and in conformity with the principle laid down in this opinion he has not been guilty of a violation of article 475 in connection with article 13, No. 3, nor in any other manner. <br/><br/>The conviction of the defendants in accordance with article 568, together with article 29 of General Orders, No. 58, has not been prayed for, and even if it had been we do not consider the evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction in accordance with this article. Her husband had the right to accept the sworn statement of the woman. The only person whom she could ask for information was her father, and he had told her age repeatedly. <br/><br/>For the reasons above set forth the sentence of the lower court is reversed with reference to both defendants, acquitting them freely with costs of suit de oficio. <br/><br/>It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Torres and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the morning of April 7, 1898, between the hours of 9 and 11, on the road between the towns of Mabolo and Mandaue, the defendant, Leoncio Alfont, commanding a group of insurgents against Spanish rule, shot and killed with the rifle he was carrying a woman called Eduviges Monteclaro. The deceased at the time of her death was in a quilez driven by herself in which she had come from the city of Cebu. <br/><br/>The facts constituting the crime of homicide defined and punished under article 404 of the Penal Code are fully established in the record by the testimony of witnesses who had knowledge of the occurrence and saw the corpse of the deceased, and also by the admissions of the accused himself. He pleaded not guilty to the charge, and in his testimony stated that he had not intended to kill the woman Eduviges but had fired solely to intimidate her and to compel her to stop the quilez she was driving, as she had not halted when challenged by the defendant; and that as his horse happened to rear just at the time he fired the shot the charge struck the quilez, without his knowing whether or not the person within was wounded or killed. <br/><br/>Against this explanation, which certainly is not confirmed by the testimony of his witnesses, the case offers data of weight and merit sufficient to produce full moral conviction of the guilt of the accused, as the sole principal by direct participation of the violent death of the woman Eduviges Montecarlo, and they are in effect as follows: The statement which the accused made to the husband of the deceased on the very morning of the happening, stating that he had just killed the latter’s wife and if he did not move off he would kill him also, which statement was heard by three witnesses, who furthermore affirmed that they had heard the accused say that he had killed Monteclaro because she was a spy of the Spaniards; the contradictory and conflicting statements of the accused in his sworn testimony, and the fact that it was a matter of public rumor, to which several witnesses testified, that the defendant was the one who killed Eduviges. All of these facts taken together are sufficient to produce a reasonable conviction of his guilt, and the shot which caused the death of the deceased can not be considered as an involuntary act or one due to imprudence. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime it is not proper to consider the existence of any circumstances either mitigating or aggravating, although in view of the conditions of disorder which prevailed on the date of the occurrence there should be taken into account the circumstance mentioned in article 11 of the Code for the sole purpose of reducing the penalty. <br/><br/>Neither does justice require the admission of the contention made at the trial by the counsel for the defense, to wit, that Leoncio Alfont fired at the deceased because she disobeyed an order prohibiting the passing of a line established by the insurgents — because the band captained by Alfont was made up of seditious uprisers who went about from place to place without discipline or organization, and on the scene of the occurrence there was neither trench, line of defense, military position, nor established encampment with military rules, methods, or regulations. Therefore it was impossible that there should have been a violation of the same on the part of the deceased which could justify or excuse her violent death, and for that reason the criminal act in question must be treated as an ordinary crime committed during rebellion or sedition, and to be punished according to article 244 of the Penal Code and the provisions thereof, since the death of Eduviges Monteclaro was not necessary or indispensable to the object and purpose of the rebels. <br/><br/>Based upon the considerations set forth it is deemed proper to affirm the sentence appealed from, it being understood furthermore that the defendant is condemned to the payment of an indemnity of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the widower and heirs of the deceased and to the payment of costs. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

Without a consolidation of these causes the judge has considered together the proofs adduced in each of them and has rendered a judgment of conviction not only of the robbery prosecuted in cause No. 11 but also of that prosecuted in cause No. 10. <br/><br/>The procedure followed by the court below violates an essential right of the accused, inasmuch as he is entitled, although accused of the two offenses, to a trial in each one of the two cases in question upon the proofs adduced in each individual case, and upon the allegations set forth in each information. It is not permissible to take into account or consider in one case the facts proved in the other, and vice versa. Therefore, since each of the two robberies should be punished independently and separately, it follows that the single judgment rendered for the two actions in cause No. 11 (one of them) is a nullity, and the sentence appealed from must be reversed and the two causes remanded to the court of Bulacan with instructions to enter the proper judgment in accordance with law in each one of them.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the morning of June 29, 1900, Segundo Labitoria was present in the house of Geronimo Leal for the purpose of ascertaining from the latter who had stolen two jars of basi belonging to him. Pablo Laranang appeared in the house and after the three had been drinking basi with Baldomero Lacasandeli and when they had become intoxicated, Laranang, upon the prompting of Leal, whom Labitoria accused of the theft of the two jars of basi, assaulted Labitoria with a bolo, inflicting upon him seven wounds which then and there produced his death. The wounds upon the head and side were necessarily mortal, and the remainder serious, according to the practitioner who examined them. Although Lacasandeli endeavored to leave the said house upon seeing Labitoria dead, the slayer of the latter, Laranang, detained him and likewise called to Rufino Lastimosa, who was passing casually in front of the house where the occurrence took place, in order that they should assist them in burying the corpse. This they did in a cane field near the house. On the fourth day, and after investigations made at the instance of the family of the deceased, the corpse of Labitoria was there found by the local authorities of the town of Taguding. <br/><br/>The facts related and fully proved at the trial by ocular inspection, expert evidence, the testimony of witnesses, and the confession of the accused constitute the crime of homicide defined and penalized in article 404 of the Penal Code. In the commission of the homicide there do not appear to have been any general or specific circumstances of aggravation or mitigation which might increase or decrease the penalty. <br/><br/>The evidence shows that Pablo Laranang and Geronimo Leal are guilty of the crime as principals and Baldomero Lacasandeli and Rufino Lastimosa as accessories. Laranang pleaded guilty, confessing that he attacked the deceased with a bolo upon the instigation of the owner of the house, Geronimo Leal, and stated he was so intoxicated at the time that he could not give an account of what he did after Leal had told him to kill Labitoria. He is, therefore, the actual author of the crime. <br/><br/>The owner of the house, Geronimo Leal, at first pleaded guilty of the crime of which he was accused, but later on he withdrew this plea and stated that he was not guilty of the criminal act. Nevertheless, the guilt of this defendant is established beyond a doubt in spite of his denial and of his statement that he merely assisted in the burial of the corpse, by the testimony of his confessed partner in crime, Laranang, that he had killed Labitoria upon the inducement of the owner of the house, Geronimo Leal, who witnessed the execution of the crime in his own house; the fact that Leal disappeared and absented himself from his house from the date of the occurrence; and the fact that the deceased, a few moments before, had an altercation with him concerning the disappearance of the two jars of basi which the defendant accused him of having stolen. From this it follows that Leal alone had motives of resentment or revenge which might lead him to desire the death of Labitoria, and it would appear that after inviting the latter to come to his house Leal lacked the determination to kill him himself, and therefore induced Laranang to do so. There is nothing in the case to show that the latter had any motive for killing Labitoria, and this circumstance strongly tends to show that he acted upon inducement. Again, if this were not the case, and if there had been no ill feeling toward the deceased on the part of Leal, he would not have been an indifferent spectator of a crime such as this, perpetrated in his own house, and which it was his duty to have attempted to prevent. These conclusions, drawn from an examination of the case, are quite sufficient to convince us of the guilt of the defendant Leal. <br/><br/>There can be no doubt as to the participation in the crime of the other defendants, Baldomero Lacasandeli and Rufino Lastimosa, as accessories. Lacasandeli was present when the crime was committed, and although this is not true as to Lastimosa, nevertheless upon entering the house he saw a corpse covered with wounds, and although neither of these defendants took part in the perpetration of the crime itself, they nevertheless aided the principals to conceal the body by unlawfully burying it in a field to that end and by neglecting to inform the authorities of the facts known to them. <br/><br/>The provisions of article 9, paragraph 6 of the Penal Code must be applied in mitigation of the penalty, as the crime was committed while the principals were in an intoxicated condition, and it does not appear that they were habitual drunkards. We do not think it proper to allow the principals, Leal and Laranang, the benefits of the special circumstance established in article 11 of the Penal Code, because of the conditions of these defendants, and of the fact that the crime committed by them has of late become very frequent. There are, however, no aggravating circumstances against them to increase the criminal liability they have incurred. <br/><br/>For the sole purpose of reducing the penalty we are of the opinion that we are justified in giving the accessories, Lacasandeli and Lastimosa, the benefit of article 11, as there are no aggravating circumstances against them, and because from the nature of their offense and their personal conditions it is to be presumed that they did not fully realize that it was their duty to report the facts to the authorities, and that they would become criminally responsible for their failure to do so and for their participation in the occurrence. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated, therefore, the defendants Laranang and Leal are subject to punishment by the minimum grade of the penalty of reclusion temporal and the defendants Lacasandeli and Lastimosa also by the minimum grade of the penalty of prision correccional, which is the penalty two degrees below that assigned by the law to the consummated offense. Therefore the defendants Pablo Laranang and Geronimo Leal are condemned each one to thirteen years of reclusion temporal, together with the accessories prescribed by article 59 of the Code, and to the payment of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of the deceased; the accessories Baldomero Lacasandeli and Rufino Lastimosa are condemned each one to six months and one day of prision correccional, the accessory penal ties fixed by article 61, and to subsidiary liability for the payment of the indemnification, pro rata or in solidum, in case of the insolvency of the principals, or else to subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third part of the principal penalty, and to the payment by each one of the four defendants of one-quarter part of the costs caused, the defendants Lacasandeli and Lastimosa to be given credit for one-half of the time they have been detention prisoners in the computation of the principal penalty. The court below will take such action as may be proper with respect to the property attached. <br/><br/>With respect to the contention of the Solicitor-General that the court should set aside the judgment as a nullity on the ground that it was rendered after the 16th of June last by a judge who at the time of his decision had ceased to be such, and was therefore without jurisdiction, the court, upon the authority of the case of the United States v. Cayetano Abalos, supra, holds that the objection can not be sustained. <br/><br/>Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> and Mapa, <em>J.</em>, dissent. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from the judgment given by the Court of First Instance of Binondo in favor of the plaintiff in the action for eviction commenced for the purpose of recovering the possession of a basement story occupied by the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that he was the owner of the house of which the basement story formed a part and that the defendant had been occupying the said basement as a tenant at will without paying any rent therefor and that he had given her a month’s notice to vacate the place. <br/><br/>The plaintiff alleges that the property belongs to him by virtue of the will of Doña Tiburcia Ortiz, deceased, who at the time of her death was the owner of the same. The plaintiff has filed a copy of the notarial instrument from which it appears that the Court of First Instance of Binondo had ordered the registration of a document which is said to be the will of the said party by which the latter constitutes the plaintiff her universal heir. At the trial before the lower court the defendant asked the stay of the proceedings for two reasons: First, that the defendant had moved for an injunction permitting her to retain and recover the possession of the house in question as against the plaintiff and that the defendant had moved the Court of First Instance of Tondo from which the judgment was sought for the consolidation of those proceedings with the present action, and second, that the defendant had filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance of Intramuros for the falsification of the will of Doña Tiburcia. <br/><br/>The court below, without having previously ruled upon the petition for stay of the proceedings, ordered that the defendant answer the complaint on its merits. The attorney for the defendant then interposed two dilatory exceptions, namely, the want of jurisdiction of the court and the pendency of another action — the last based upon the fact that there was still pending the injunction as well as the demand for the exhibition of the will of Doña Tiburcia and a probate proceeding, which she stated were pending in the court of Quiapo. <br/><br/>From copies of the documents taken from the judicial records filed by the defendant at the trial held in the court below it appears indeed that the said records filed by the defendant at the trial held in the court below it appears indeed that the said injunction proceeding had been commenced. Concerning the petition for the consolidation as well as the proceedings before the Court of Quiapo, there were no proofs other than the statement of the attorney. No proof whatever was presented concerning the criminal complaint except the statement made by the attorney that the same had been filed. <br/><br/>It appears from the record that the defendant in spite of having been given by the court full opportunity to do so did not answer to the merits of the complaint. The plaintiff had the right therefore to have judgment dictated in his favor unless the dilatory exceptions interposed by the defendant should be sustained, or unless the court had committed error in not staying the proceedings in order to await the determination of the motion for consolidation as well as of the criminal case. <br/><br/>We believe that the dilatory exceptions were properly overruled. <br/><br/>The jurisdiction of the court appears to be unquestionable, since this is one of the cases included in No. 2 of article 1545 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the property is situated within the jurisdiction of the court. <br/><br/>With reference to the exception of the pendency of another action, we understand that the defendant can not avail herself of this objection in a summary proceeding like the present one. <br/><br/>Supposing that a petition praying for the consolidation of these proceedings with those for injunction had been presented, we are of the opinion that it should have been denied (art. 148, Code of Civil Procedure), and therefore the course of the court below was proper in refusing to suspend the proceedings on such grounds. <br/><br/>Inasmuch as the defendant did not prove and in our opinion did not even allege in the record that the criminal complaint had been admitted, she therefore had no right to stay of proceedings in accordance with the provisions of article 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>In his argument at the hearing of this appeal, the defendant asked for the hearing of evidence at second instance in order to set forth the facts concerning the criminal complaint. This request should be denied on the ground that it has not been declared that the proofs would disclose that the said complaint had been admitted, and furthermore because it does not appear that the defendant has been prevented from presenting said proofs in the court below. (Art. 845 of the Code of Civil Procedure.) <br/><br/>The judgment is affirmed with costs taxed against the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">For failure to pay the sum of 3,929 pesos and 60 cents, the amount specified in a promissory note executed by Don Jose Regalado y Santa Ana in favor of Messrs. Luchsinger &amp; Co., the latter commenced an executive action in 1893. A preliminary attachment was ordered and was levied upon, among other properties, a warehouse with galvanized iron roof together with the land upon which it was located situated on the sea wall of the city of Iloilo. Nevertheless this attachment was not recorded in the register of property. When the decree of sale of the property was made in the executive action the order could not be carried out in spite of the fact that this land and warehouse had, by order of the court, been put in the possession of Don Juan Yncher as receiver or depositary, because the defendant had sold the attached property in 1900, as unincumbered for the sum of 15,000 pesos to his son, Don Pedro Regalado. Both the vendor and the purchaser of the property knew that it had been attached by an order made in the executive action which was still pending. This transfer was made without the consent of the plaintiff’s creditors and without the authorization of the court or the knowledge of the receiver, and upon these grounds attorney Jose Ma. Gay, in the name of the creditors whose interests were supposed to be defrauded, filed a complaint against the defendant charging him with the crime of swindling (estafa). <br/><br/>The failure to record in the register of property the attachment levied upon the property belonging to the defendant, Don Jose Regalado y Santa Ana, is a defect so vital that it prevents us from holding that the crime of swindling has been committed by the disposal of the property in the sale made by the defendant to his son, Don Pedro Regalado. Such recordation is obligatory, not optional, and does not depend upon the discretion of the court or the will of the plaintiff in view of the imperative character of the rule laid down in article 1435 of the Code of Civil procedure, which makes express reference to a preceding article, No. 1391, which provides that the attachment of real property shall be effected only by a writ addressed to the registrar directing that the attachment be opportunely inscribed in the register of property in accordance with the prevailing provisions of the law. <br/><br/>It follows, therefore, that no incumbrance exists. As a matter of law there can be no levy upon real property — although it was otherwise before the enactment for these Islands of the Code of Civil Procedure which went into effect on the 12th of November, 1888 — unless the attachment appears inscribed in the register of property in the manner provided by article 43 of the Mortgage Law. The mere issuance of the attachment made by virtue of a judicial order in an executive action or in proceedings for a preventive attachment, or in proceedings for the execution of a judgment, is not sufficient to affect any property with an incumbrance or subject it to the claim sued upon. For such purpose it is essential that the inscription be made. <br/><br/>For the reasons given it must be held that the fact that the defendant, Don Jose Regalado, conveyed the said warehouse together with the lot on which it stands, which were attached at the instance of Luchsinger &amp; Co., does not constitute the crime of swindling, because in spite of the order of attachment there was no legal or effective incumbrance upon said real property for the reason that this attachment was not inscribed in the register of property. This is an essential requisite, failing which the property can not be deemed incumbered and the defendant who sold the same to a third person can not be deemed included within the terms of article 537, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Therefore, in our opinion the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with the costs de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In the year 1900 the defendant was the agent in Vigan of the business house known as  \"The Philippine Trading Company.\" In the month of March he signed a document with the name of Luis Encarnacion in which it was made to appear that the latter had received from him as such agent the sum of $150 on account of the purchase of 100 picos of maguey. In July he signed with the same name a similar receipt for the sum of $970. During the trial the defendant confessed that it was true that the receipts were false, that he had not bought maguey from Encarnacion, and that he had not paid the latter any money. He signed the receipts in imitation of the writing and rubric of Encarnacion. <br/><br/>The accused kept the said receipts in his house without having delivered or shown them to anyone or made any use of them. Van Sternberghe, then the cashier of the accused, produced them to the court. It does not appear how the latter obtained them, although the counsel for the defendant stated at the trial in the court below that while the accused was absent in Manila Van Sternberghe, who lived in his house, took the said receipts. <br/><br/>The defendant made false entries in the books of the company by which it appears there were paid to Encarnacion on the dates of the receipts the sums which are stated therein. Nevertheless he is not accused of any crime based upon the said entries. The complaint is limited to the falsification of the receipts. It is probable that the entries were made first, the receipts having been drawn up later in order that they might be availed of in corroboration of the entries. It is not explained to us how the fact of the existence of these entries can have any relation to the facts of the case. It is not proved that prejudice to the company might have arisen because of the entries or the receipts. <br/><br/>The crime provided for and punished in article 304 is not committed by the mere falsification of the document. It does not suffice that the document itself be false, but there must also be proved the prejudice caused to a third person or the intention to cause it. And here we find a certain difference between this and other crimes, as, for example, the counterfeiting of money. (Art. 280.) In order to cause prejudice to a third person it is absolutely necessary to make use of the falsified document after it is written — that the person who executes it realizes some act which makes it effective. If a person falsifies a promissory note and keeps it in his house it can not in any manner operate to the prejudice of a third person. If an individual falsifies a promissory note and, after keeping it in his house for a time, destroys it, he does not prejudice anyone by the mere fact of having made it. It is evident that a person can not be declared guilty under the first clause of this article  \"to the prejudice of a third person\" unless he does two things; in the first place he must have counterfeited the false document, and secondly, he must have performed an independent act which operates to the prejudice of a third person. It appears equally evident that the same rule should be applied to the second clause  \"with intent of causing it.\" In the first place he must have counterfeited the document, and secondly, he must have performed some other independent act in order to make use of it — an act which, while it does not result in prejudice to a third party, has been done nevertheless with the intention of causing such prejudice. The fact that no prejudice has been caused would not be due in such case to the desistance of the defendant himself but to causes absolutely independent of his will. To maintain the contrary would be equivalent to completely suppress from the article the phrase  \"to the prejudice of a third person,\" because in every case there exists undoubtedly in the mind of the falsifier at the time of uttering the document the idea or intention to make unlawful use of the same to the prejudice of a third person. Let us suppose the case in which a person falsifies a check authenticating it with the signature of another who has money on deposit in the bank. He presents the said check at the bank and the employees of the latter, without noting the falsification, pay him the money. In this case he is guilty under the first clause, since he has caused prejudice to the bank. Suppose that he presents the check and the employees on noting the falsification refuse to deliver him the money. In this case he is guilty under the second clause, for, although nobody is prejudiced, he had the intention of causing prejudice by having performed certain acts to that end. Supposing that he falsifies the check and keeps it in the house without making use thereof, he can not be considered guilty in accordance with either of the two clauses. <br/><br/>The law never punishes the mere intention to commit a crime. For this it is necessary that something be done in the way of putting such intention into effect. In order to class as criminal even acts of this kind they must constitute an attempted crime according to article 3 of the Penal Code prevailing. It results evidently that the acts committed by the defendant in this case do not fall within the terms of said article. <br/><br/>The judgment is therefore reversed and the defendant freely acquitted with the costs de oficio. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

Llames executed a receipt for the said sum (dated October 26, 1897), falsifying therein the signatures of the collector of internal revenue, Joaquin Mendoza, and of the superintendent; Ramon Maria Saidin, which to all appearances authorize the said document, which is of the kind which is issued by the Internal Revenue Department, and is on one of the regular printed forms. The falsity of the receipt was discovered, and the document, together with the defendant, was sent to the Court of First Instance, with an official communication from the Civil Governor in which he stated that the accused had confessed his guilt. <br/><br/>The facts related, which are fully established by the evidence adduced by the testimony of the officers mentioned, as well as that of the complaining witness, Gregorio Loriña, owner of the amount embezzled, and by the certificate by which it is certified that the defendant did not turn over the said sum to the treasury of the internal-revenue office, constitute the compound crime of embezzlement with falsification of an official document, penalized in articles 300, 301, and 535, No. 5, together with article 89 of the Penal Code. The crime of falsification was committed as a means to the embezzlement from Gregorio Loriña of the sum which the latter paid through the medium of the said Chinaman as forestry fees which he owed to the Internal Revenue Department. Therefore the falsification was a necessary means to the consummation of the embezzlement, because the accused, upon the payment of the money to him, was obliged to give an apparently authentic receipt for it. <br/><br/>Of these crimes the sole principal by direct participation, confessed and convicted, is the defendant, Juan Llames, who, in his examination, admitted that he had executed the false document in his own house, imitating the signatures of the collector and superintendent, availing himself of one of the printed forms which were on hand in the office for receipts and filling with written words the blank lines, and that he had spent the money received. <br/><br/>In the commission of this compound crime no generic circumstance, either mitigating or aggravating, is to be considered, nor should there be considered the circumstance provided for in article 11 of the Code, for the reason that the defendant, as a clerk, had sufficient enlightenment to understand the grave character of the acts which he committed and of their consequences. Therefore the defendant has incurred the maximum degree of the penalty for the graver crime — that is to say, the medium grade of presidio mayor, according to article 89 of the Code. <br/><br/>In virtue, then, of the considerations set forth the sentence reviewed should be reversed, Juan Llames sentenced to the penalty of eleven years of presidio mayor, to a fine of 5,000 pesetas, to the accessory penalties provided in article 57 of the Code, to the payment of an indemnity of 15 pesos and 25 centimos, Mexican currency, to the aggrieved party, Loriña, without subsidiary imprisonment for inability to pay the fine and the indemnity, according to article 51 of the Code, and to the payment of the costs in both instances. The order declaring the insolvency of the defendant, made in the attachment proceedings, is approved. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The petitioner, Arthur W. Prautch, makes application to this court for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> and a writ of <em>certiorari</em>, alleging in his petition that he is unlawfully held by the Sheriff of Manila by an order made by the Court of First Instance in a civil suit pending in that court, under article 412, Code of Civil Procedure (1901), which provides for the arrest of defendant in certain civil cases. <br/><br/>It is alleged in the application that the suit in the Court of First Instance is based upon a cause of action which arose between the plaintiff and defendant on the 20th day of August, 1900, and it is contended that the court did not have jurisdiction to make the order of arrest, because at the date of the making of the contract there was no law then in existence authorizing an arrest in civil cases, such provision having been enacted by the Code of Civil Procedure, which went into effect the 1st day of October, 1901. <br/><br/>It is insisted that to sustain the proceedings would be giving the law a retroactive effect and that it would impair the obligation of the contract, and that a new remedy has been provided which changes the legal character and effect of the contract by taking away a vested right acquired under an existing law, creating a new obligation, imposing a new duty, and attaching a new disability in respect to the transaction or consideration already passed. <br/><br/>We think that the principle invoked is inapplicable to this character of remedy. The right to imprison for debt is not a part of the contract. (Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat., 200; Odgen v. Saunders, 12 Wheat.; 230; U. S. v. Quincy, 71 U. S., 409; Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 625.) <br/><br/>If the right to imprison for debt is not a part of the contract the converse of the proposition is also true, that the right to exemption from imprisonment for a debt does not form a part of the contract. Such statutes are regarded as penal rather than remedial. They are enacted to prevent fraud in the making of contracts, or to prevent the subsequent fraudulent conduct of parties with reference to their obligation, and are properly invoked as a punishment for dishonesty. <br/><br/>It does not appear from the application whether the affidavit upon which the arrest was based set forth the fraudulent acts as having been committed at a time before or after the Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, and consequently it is not necessary to consider whether the statute as to prior acts would in its nature be an ex post facto law, and as to what would be the effect of a statute in such case. <br/><br/>There are other considerations equally conclusive against the right of petitioner to the writ. By provisions of section 528 of the Code of Civil Procedure (1901), if it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or magistrate or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or magistrate had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction both of the subject-matter and of the person; the remedy for arrest is provided by statute and the question as to the sufficiency of the grounds is for the determination of the court. <br/><br/>That the affidavit for the arrest is based upon insufficient grounds or that the claim upon which the suit is based is without foundation in law are questions to be determined by the Court of First Instance, and should error be committed the defendant may appeal from the decision of the court. <br/><br/>It is true that an appeal can not be taken to an interlocutory order, but upon the rendition of a final judgment disposing of the action either party has the right to perfect the bill of exceptions for a review by the Supreme Court of all rulings, order, or judgment. (Sec. 143, Code of Civil Procedure, 1901.) <br/><br/>That the defendant may suffer unjust imprisonment while waiting for a final judgment is a question to be addressed to the legislative power. <br/><br/>To prevent such result all reasonable safeguards have been placed around the remedy. The order of arrest is made by the judge; an affidavit is required to be made by the plaintiff, or some other person who knows the facts, that a sufficient cause of action exists, and that the cause is one of those mentioned in section 412. <br/><br/>Before making the order the party applying for it must execute to the defendant an obligation in an amount to be fixed by the judge, and with sufficient surety to be approved by him, conditioned that the plaintiff will pay all costs which may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest if the same shall finally be adjudged to have been wrongful or without sufficient cause. And, finally, the defendant arrested may at any time before the trial of the action apply to the judge who made the order, or to the court in which the action is pending, upon reasonable notice, to vacate the order of arrest or to reduce the amount of bail. <br/><br/>Upon such application the judge or court shall grant an immediate hearing, after notice to the parties, and upon hearing make such orders as appear to be just as to continuing the order of arrest or vacating same or reducing the amount of bail required. (Secs. 413, 414, 415, 423, Code of Civil Procedure, 1901.) <br/><br/>Without considering the question of the practice of joining in the same petition an application for both <em>habeas corpus</em> and <em>certiorari</em>, it is clear that a writ of <em>certiorari</em> can not be granted in such a case as is presented here. <br/><br/>Under the provisions of the Code in <em>certiorari</em> proceedings, it is necessary that it should appear both that the inferior court has exceeded its jurisdiction and that there is no appeal from such court. (Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, sec. 217.) <br/><br/>The application for writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> and <em>certiorari</em> is denied, and costs taxed against petitioner. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I concur with the opinion of the majority in the denial of the petition, but my opinion is based upon the following reasons: The affidavit upon which was issued the order of arrest contains this clause,  \"that the said Arthur W. Prautch has concealed or disposed of all the money appropriated and not paid by him as aforesaid, and has removed and disposed of all his property and of all the property of the house of Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. aforementioned with intent to defraud his creditors.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It does not appear whether this act took place before or after the 1st of October, 1901, when the prevailing Code of Procedure went into effect. If it took place after this date it could not be seriously contended that the law did not authorize the arrest. Supposing that on the date on which the debt was contracted the debtor might have had the right to defraud his creditors by means of such transfers, to contend that such a privilege continues attached to the debt in such a manner that the law can not take it away would be to contend that an individual could have a vested right to defraud his creditors. <br/><br/>It was the duty of the petitioner to show that the court had committed error, and therefore the burden was upon him to prove that the act in question took place before the 1st of October. Not having done so he can not raise the question of whether or not the arrest can be ordered for a cause arising prior to said date, and we do not decide that question. <br/><br/>It remains to be considered whether the alleged defects in the affidavit, pointed out by the petitioner, affect the competency of the court in such a manner as to make null and void the order made by virtue of the same, or whether said order was merely voidable and the error which has been committed in making the same was one of those which can be remedied by means of an appeal. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court of the United States has said:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"It may be confessed that it is not always very easy to determine what matters go to the jurisdiction of a court so as to make its action when erroenous a nullity. But the general rule is, that when the court has jurisdiction by law of the offense charged and of the party who is so charged, its judgments are not nullities.\" (Ex parte Bigelow, 113 U. S., 328.) <br/><br/>In this case we have an action pending in which the court below has jurisdiction. We have a law which authorizes the arrest when the cause of action has accrued after the 1st of October. We have a defendant who committed an act after the said date which warrants his arrest. Under these circumstances the court has the right to order his arrest. According to the text of the Code the court  \"has jurisdiction to issue the writ or make the order.\" (Art. 528.) <br/><br/>The jurisdiction of the court does not proceed from the filing of the affidavit but rather from the existence of the facts above set forth. Considering the existence of facts which may confer jurisdiction the question of whether those facts are presented in such a manner in the affidavit as to invoke the exercise of this jurisdiction is one which the court has the same right to determine as it would have in the decision of any other questions which might arise in a matter within its cognizance. In the exercise of this power it may issue an erroneous order, but such an order is not absolutely void; unless it is remedied during the same action by means of an appeal or otherwise, it will have the effect of a valid order. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance should not give a judgment upon a complaint on a promissory note which does not state a cause of action, but if it does so its judgment is valid unless it is reversed by means of appeal. <br/><br/>We can not defer to any decision of the supreme court of California which sustains a contrary doctrine. Article 528, already cited, establishes the law of these Islands, and we must submit to that. To accept the other rule would be to convert the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> into a writ of error, a thing which is in no wise permissible. It would make it possible for any defendant by means of such writ to interpose an appeal to this court in all those cases in which an order of arrest should be issued and would oblige us to review the errors of law which are alleged to have been committed by the court in investigating the sufficiency of the affidavit, and this is, in our opinion, the very practice which article 528 seeks to avoid. <br/><br/>Errors of this kind can be remedied by an appeal from the judgment. (Art. 143.) If the order was erroneous the plaintiff must answer upon his bond to the defendant for the damages and injuries which the latter suffers. (Art. 415.) That this right of appeal is not by reason of the delay in securing it an adequate remedy is a matter which should be submitted to the legislature and not to the courts. <br/><br/>The release prayed for should be denied, with the costs taxed against the petitioner. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">About 10 o’clock in the morning of October 16, 1900, Rosario de Guzman went to the house of Doña Victorina Leonquingco, located in the district of Santa Cruz, and, on the pretense that she had a purchaser who wished to see the jewels, took from the latter several pieces of gold jewelry set with diamonds, of the total value of 730 pesos. These she promised to return, or to pay over their value in case they were sold, on the afternoon of the same day. As she did not do so, the son of the owner of the jewelry went in search of her on the following day. He was not able to find her until some days had passed, and then the defendant Guzman pleaded with Leonquingco that she be given an extension of time for the return of the jewelry. She failed, however, upon various pretexts, to return the jewels. <br/><br/>The facts related are fully proved in the cause by the testimony of several witnesses and by the confession of the defendant, and constitute the crime of embezzlement (estafa), defined and penalized in article 534, No. 2, and article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, since evidence shows that Rosario de Guzman had received from the complaining witness, Victorina Leonquingco, various pieces of jewelry, valued at 730 pesos, for the purpose of selling them, subject to the express obligation of delivering their value or returning them to their owner if they should not be sold. Not having done so, and having failed to give an account of their whereabouts, the legal presumption arises that the defendant abstracted and appropriated to herself the jewelry received, to the grave prejudice of the owner of the same, inasmuch as she neither returned them nor paid their value, as was her duty. <br/><br/>Of the crime charged, the sole proven principal by direct participation, confessed and convicted, is the defendant, Rosario de Guzman. Her assertion, even if substantiated, that she delivered the jewels to a broker, who states that she either lost them later or that they were stolen from her — and there is no proof of this — and that the complaining witness has entered into an agreement with her for the payment of their value in installments, would constitute no defense. The reason for this is that it is not within the discretion of the parties to change the nature of criminal causes, which are public in character, by converting them into civil actions; and the alleged agreement, even if true and established by proof, would not demonstrate that there has not been fraud on the part of the accused, or prejudice to the owner of the jewelry; fraud and prejudice which took place and which may not be atoned by the restoration of the embezzled property, the greater part of which, indeed, has not been restored. <br/><br/>In the commission of this crime there is no extenuating or aggravating circumstance to be considered, and therefore the appropriate penalty should be imposed in its medium degree. <br/><br/>By virtue of the foregoing considerations we deem it proper that the judgment appealed from be reversed and that Rosario de Guzman be condemned to the penalty of five months of arresto mayor, together with the accessory penalties of article 61, and the payment of an indemnity equal to the value of the jewelry embezzled in case same be not finally returned, or the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed the third part of the principal penalty, and to the payment of costs in both instances.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from the judgment given in favor of the defendant by the Court of First Instance of Manila in the action of interdiction instituted for the purpose of retaining the possession of the half story and to recover the possession of the upper story of the same house. <br/><br/>It appears that the plaintiff lived in the house as a servant of the owner, one Tiburcia Ortiz, at the time of the death of the latter, which occurred on December 22, 1899. After the death of Doña Tiburcia the plaintiff continued in the house, occupying the upper floor of the same for some time and later having removed to the half story. The record is silent concerning the circumstances under which she changed to the half story, save that she did so in order that certain relatives of Doña Tiburcia might temporarily occupy the rooms of the upper story. When they ceased to occupy these rooms, and, as it appears, while the plaintiff still lived in the half story, the defendant rented the rooms to other parties. This is the ouster on which the plaintiff bases her claim that she be again placed in the possession of said rooms. It likewise appears that the defendant, asserting his right as owner of the house demanded of the plaintiff, through the medium of a notary, that she vacate the half story. The plaintiff contends that this implies such disturbance in her possession of the half story that it gives her the right to be protected in such possession by the law. The defendant, after having made this notarial demand, commenced an action of eviction, which was decided in his favor. (See Fabie v. Guzman, supra.) <br/><br/>The plaintiff contended that the property belonged to her as legatee of Doña Tiburcia under a will executed in 1889, no legal proof of the same having been presented, however. The defendant claimed ownership as universal heir of Doña Tiburcia under a will executed September 10, 1896, having proved that the registry of said will in the protocol had been ordered by competent authority. <br/><br/>We shall not consider the question of whether the plaintiff was ever in such possession of the property that she might maintain an action of interdiction. Nor shall we consider the question, also argued by the attorneys of the parties, whether the two interdicts to retain and to recover possession may be consolidated in one single action as the plaintiff has sought to do. We are of the opinion that the decision of the lower court is perfectly correct, based upon other grounds. <br/><br/>Whatever the possession of the plaintiff may have been with reference to the apartments of the upper floor after the death of Doña Tiburcia, there is nothing in the record which indicates, and nothing from which it might be justly inferred, that the defendant has ousted her of said possession or that she has lost the same either directly or indirectly by reason of any act committed by him. It appears that she vacated these rooms voluntarily and did not again acquire the possession thus abandoned prior to the date on which the defendant introduced his tenants. When the act was performed which she classifies as ouster in her complaint, the plaintiff did not hold any possession of which she could be ousted, and the action, considered as an interdict to recover possession, can not, therefore, be sustained. <br/><br/>It is apparent that the action, viewed as an interdict to retain possession of the half story, cannot be sustained either. The object of these interdicts is to prevent parties from dispensing justice for themselves, and not to place obstacles in their use of the ordinary legal processes. The notice to vacate given to the plaintiff was merely the first and necessary step given by the defendant in the defense, by the means which the law placed at his disposal, of that which he believed to be his right to the possession of the premises. It makes no difference whether or not be had a right to the possession. He had the right to have the court pass judgment upon his claim, and therefore he had also the right to establish the grounds for the action which he intended to commence by giving notice to vacate. The notice can not be considered as an act which manifests the intention to disturb the plaintiff in her possession or oust her from the same within the meaning of article 1633 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>The plaintiff contends that the trial held before the lower court should have been stayed until the determination of an action filed by her against the defendant for the production of the will which is said to have been executed by Doña Tiburcia in 1899, as well as the determination of a complaint which she is said to have filed against the defendant for the falsification of the will in virtue of which he was claiming the ownership of the house. With reference to this point it suffices to state that, as appears from the record, the plaintiff filed in the lower court an incidental motion, and finally withdrew the same in express terms and prayed the court to give its judgment. <br/><br/>No error having been committed in the judgment appealed from, the same should be affirmed with costs taxed against the <em>Appellant</em>. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The testimony of the clergyman, Tranquilino Manahan, is written in such a manner that it is almost impossible to know if reference is made to threats actually made in his presence or to a narration of prior threats related to him in the interview referred to. We are inclined to believe the latter, inasmuch as it is not probable that at an interview at which the accused and the complaining witness were present, which interview seems to have been held for the purpose of securing the money which the latter had promised to pay to the accused, the defendant should have threatened the other with death if she did not do the very thing which he was then performing. <br/><br/>From this testimony it appears doubtful if in the interview referred to there was an actual and certain payment of the $125 either by the complainant or by the witness. If this payment was made, then it seems certain that there were no threats; if not, then there is lacking evidence to establish such payment. The complainant so testified in her preliminary statement and the lower court in its judgment states that this was confirmed in her statement during the trial; but it does not so appear in the record, nor does it appear that she has given any testimony whatever at the trial. <br/><br/>The witness Segunda Austria testified that the accused struck Benita Vinson because the latter had taken his jewels according to his statements. This witness says nothing concerning the question of whether threats were involved. The only witness who so affirms is Hermogenes de los Reyes. The latter says that he was called to the house of Maria Vinson, where he found the accused striking the said Maria and striking Benita Vinson, saying that he would kill them if they did not return to him the jewelry which he had lost. <br/><br/>With the record in this state we can not declare the accused guilty of a violation of article 494 of the Penal Code. The threats which are there dealt with are those made with the deliberate purpose of creating in the mind of the person threatened the belief that the threat will be carried into effect. The said article does not relate to threats which may be made at the time of an unlawful assault and which form part of the same. The Supreme Court has so declared repeatedly. (Sentences of April 13, 1874, and June 19, 1878.) <br/><br/>With reference to threats, it is seen that the accused is guilty of the misdemeanor provided for and punished in article 589. <br/><br/>It appears furthermore, from the evidence, that the defendant is guilty of the crime of compulsion (coaccion) according to the provisions of article 497 of the Penal Code. But we can not condemn him for that crime upon the present complaint. In accordance with the provisions of article 6, No. 2, of General Orders, No. 58, the crime is specified in the complaint as that of threatening (amenazas). The facts set forth in compliance with No. 3 of the same article state that the accused threatened the complainant with death and that the latter feared that he would carry out his threat. At the conclusion of the complaint it is expressly stated that the defendant is prosecuted for the violation of article 494. This construction served as the basis throughout the entire course of the trial and the attorney for the defense waived the cross-examination of one of the witnesses on the express grounds that her testimony referred solely to the violence and not to the threats. The two crimes of threats and of compulsion are distinct and can not be prosecuted in a single complaint according to article 11 of General Orders, No. 58. The fact that the complaint contains allegations which disclose that the crime of compulsion has been committed does not justify us in convicting the defendant of this crime, because of the lack of evidence to prove the crime of threats of which he is likewise accused in the complaint. <br/><br/>We decide that the accused can not be found guilty of compulsion upon this complaint, and therefore the right is reserved to the fiscal to present a further complaint against him for the aforesaid crime if it be deemed proper. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the accused condemned to five days of imprisonment (arresto) and a fine of 125 pesetas, or subsidiary imprisonment as fixed by law in G.R. of insolvency, with costs in this instance taxed officially and those of first instance taxed against <em>Appellant</em>.

Under clause 6 of this article these courts have jurisdiction  \"in all criminal cases in which a penalty of more than six months’ imprisonment or a fine exceeding one hundred dollars may be imposed.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It does not admit of doubt that the court has jurisdiction of an offense if it may impose a fine of more than $100. The fact that it may under the law impose a fine of less than $100 does not deprive it of jurisdiction. The Court would, for example, clearly have jurisdiction of the offense prescribed and punished by article 459 of the Penal Code. The fine there may be no more than $31, but it may, in the discretion of the court, be $310. So if the Code punished an offense with imprisonment for one year and a fine of $50 the court would have jurisdiction not only to direct the imprisonment but also to impose the fine. This would also be true if the fine were $200 and the imprisonment three months. <br/><br/>The prosecution in this G.R. is based upon article 458, which assigns a penalty of destierro and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas. We can not, therefore, see why it is necessary in this G.R. to decide whether the penalty of banishment is lighter or heavier than imprisonment for six months. Even assuming that it is a lighter punishment the court had, as far as this point is concerned, jurisdiction to try this G.R. because it had power to impose a fine of nearly $600. <br/><br/>It remains to be considered whether Courts of First Instance have power to impose the penalty of banishment. We do not agree with the counsel for the defendant in his claim that the language of article 56 of Act No. 136 prevents Courts of First Instance from inflicting any punishment except fine or imprisonment. Such a construction would prohibit the infliction of the death penalty. <br/><br/>The penalty of destierro is defined as follows by article 114:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Those sentenced to destierro shall be precluded from entering the place or places designated in the sentence, or within the radius therein designated, which shall include a distance of 25 kilometers at least, and 250 kilometers at most, from the place designated.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>If in this G.R. the defendant is convicted the sentence might be such as to enable him to live free from all restraint in any place in the Archipelago that was more than 25 kilometers from Manila, and to return hither upon the expiration of the penalty. Groziard (vol. 2, p.511), in distinguishing this penalty from that of confinement, says:  \"The punishment involved is, nevertheless, much less than that of confinement. For the exile there is only one prohibition — that of entering the places designated in the judgment. All other parts of the territory are free and open to his person. The criminal, sentenced to confinement, is not permitted to depart from the place whether he has been transported; the exile may go anywhere with the exception of the places designated in the judgment.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Punishment of this character is not new, for it is found in the Fuero Juzgo (law 12, title 5, book 6; law 13, title 5, book 6). It is not limited to the Spanish law. It has existed in the French, Austrian, Italian, Portuguese, and other codes. It can not be and is not claimed to be a cruel punishment. It is, however, claimed to be a punishment unusual in the United States, and therefore prohibited in these Islands by the instructions of the President to the Commission. Those instructions use the words  \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" They were, of course, taken from the Constitution of the United States and originally from the English statute. It is to be observed that the words are  \"cruel and unusual.\" To be prohibited by this provision the punishment must not only be unusual but it must also be cruel. There is no reason why unusual punishments which were not cruel should have been prohibited. If that had been done it would have been impossible to change the punishments that existed when the Constitution was adopted. A law which changes a penalty so as to make it less severe would be unconstitutional if the new penalty were an unusual one. It would prohibit the introduction in the matter of penalties of new ideas intended to ameliorate the condition of criminals. Such a construction has never been given to this provision. Speaking of the law of New York providing for electrocution the Supreme Court of the United States said:  \"The provision in reference to cruel and unusual punishments was taken from the well-known Act of Parliament of 1688, entitled ’An Act for Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and Settling the Succession of the Crown,’ in which, after rehearsing various grounds of grievance, and among others, that ’excessive bail hath been required of persons committed in criminal cases to elude the benefit of the laws made for the liberty of the subjects; and excessive fines have been imposed; and illegal and cruel punishment inflicted’ — it is declared that ’excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.’ (Stat. 1 W. &amp; M., chap. 2.)\" <br/><br/>So that, if the punishment prescribed for an offense against the laws of the State were manifestly cruel and unusual, as burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking on the wheel or the like, it would be the duty of the courts to adjudge such penalties to be within the constitutional prohibition. And we think this equally true of the Eighth Amendment, in its application to Congress. <br/><br/>In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., 130, 135, Mr. Justice Clifford, in delivering the opinion of the court, referring to Blackstone, said:  \"Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent of the constitutional provision, which provides that cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted; but it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture, such as those mentioned by the commentator referred to, and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by that Amendment to the Constitution.’ Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death; but the punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there is something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"The courts of New York held that the mode adopted in this instance might be said to be unusual because it was new, but that it could not be assumed to be cruel in the light of that common knowledge which has stamped certain punishments as such.\" (Ex parte Kemmeler, 136 U. S. 436.) <br/><br/>By disposing of this claim on this ground we do not wish to be understood as giving our assent to the proposition that the said instructions could in any event have any bearing on this G.R. . It is not necessary to pass upon this question and we do not do so. <br/><br/>The defendant demurred to the complaint on three grounds: The first attacked the jurisdiction of the court, the other two were directed to the sufficiency of the complaint. The court expressly refrained from passing upon these and limited itself to deciding that the court was without jurisdiction. These objections were made before the defendant had pleaded to the complaint. Article 9 of General Orders, No. 58, allows the complaint to be amended before that time in substance or form without leave of the court. When the G.R. is remanded the complaining witness will have that right. Article 23 of General Orders, No. 58, provides also that if the court below sustains a demurrer for defects in the complaint it has the power to order a new complaint to be filed. The court may take this course if, upon the remanding of the G.R., the demurrer is renewed and sustained. For these reasons we decline to consider the other points raised by the demurrer. <br/><br/>The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed therein according to law, with costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In the present case we find it necessary to determine but one question, which is as follows: Will the summary writ of recovery (interdicto de recobrar) lie against one who is not the party committing the ouster, but is a third party to whom the latter has delivered the realty? The law upon this point has undergone some radical changes. The annotator of the publication La Publicidad, speaking of law 30, title 2, partida 3, says:  \"The summary writ of recovery introduced by the canonical law, is much more advantageous than the Roman writ ’unde vi,’ because, among other reasons, the former is a real action and will lie, therefore, against any possessor of the thing, while the latter is personal and is directed only against the party who ejects or ousts. For this reason the latter disappeared in practice and there is used only the writ of recovery.\" The Law of the Partidas declares expressly that the writ will lie against the ousting party or a third person who has received the realty with knowledge of the ouster. There existed likewise in the Roman law another writ called  \"utrubi,\" which might be directed against any person whatsoever, even though he be a possessor in good faith, provided that the plaintiff must prove that during the preceding year he had possessed the realty for a period greater than that of the possession of the defendant. (Revista de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia, vol. 81, p. 27.) <br/><br/>All of these writs have been abolished by the Law of Procedure of 1855. The Law of the Partidas and the canonical writ disappeared; they were replaced by the provisions of article 724 and the succeeding articles. In this article there is no declaration that the action is a real action against any person; the law does not state that the writ will lie against the disturbing party or a third person who has entered into possession of the realty with knowledge of the ouster. The omission in this place of some such provision when the same formerly had formed a part of the Law of the Partidas is an almost conclusive proof that the intention of the legislator was to repeal such law. <br/><br/>In accordance with article 724 it should appear from the complaint\" (2) That he has been disturbed in this possession or tenancy, designating the person creating the disturbance.\" In all of the following articles when there is mention made of the person against whom the writ is directed reference is made only to the party disturbing the possession. (Boletin de la Revista General de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia, vol. 40. p. 530.) <br/><br/>The procedure of the two writs having been reformed and made one, and included in a single section of the Code of 1881, promulgated in the Philippines in 1888, the word  \"despojante\" (\"disturber\") is no longer applied to the writ of retention and in its place was substituted the word  \"demandado\" (\"defendant\"); but the said word still remains in that part of article 1640 which is expressly applicable to the writ of recovery. According to the Code of Civil Procedure for the Philippines it is necessary that one fact appear from the complaint  \"whether said acts were done by the defendant or by another at the instance of the defendant.\" (Art. 1634, No. 2.) It appears to us that this wording expressly limits the action to two persons — he who commits the disturbance and he who has ordered the same — and necessarily excludes the idea that the action can be directed against a third person who is found in possession of the realty within the year. Manresa says:  \"The action must be directed always against the true author of the disturbance.\" (Comentarios de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil, vol. 6, p. 140; judgment of October 11, 1898.) <br/><br/>In no way can it be inferred that this writ, such as it exists in the Code last mentioned, is a real action. By the express terms of the Code (art. 1638) the court is prohibited from admitting evidence concerning the title to the realty in question. Article 1640 says:  \"The parties shall have reserved to them all rights which they may have to the property or to the definitive possession thereof, and they may enforce the same in the appropriate action.\" The fact that the plaintiff is not required to present any title in justification of his claim indicates that it can not be a real action, for the reason that it is difficult to conceive of such action without evidence relating to the title. If we should decide that the writ might be directed against a third person we should have to hold that it would lie even against one who had no knowledge of the ouster. The Law of the Partidas excluded such person, but nothing exists in this law which would justify us in making such an exception. We should have to hold that if a person buys real property from another who was in possession and held a perfect title to the same duly recorded, and after acquiring the same enters into possession thereof, the new purchaser might be summarily evicted by a person without any title or claim of title to the realty who would be able to prove that within the year he had had the tenancy of said property and had been ousted from the same by the former owner. We can not give our assent to any such doctrine. <br/><br/>There remains for us to determine whether the defendant is the person who actually ousted the plaintiff from his possession. From the proofs adduced it is evident that the properties were attached by the so-called government of Malolos; the agents of this organization took possession of the properties and subsequently delivered them to the defendant. The questions directed by the plaintiff to all of the witnesses who testified in his behalf take this fact for granted. The question is as follows:  \"Whether Abella took possession after the raising of the attachment levied upon said properties by the alleged Filipino government.\" Nicolas Vivente Ortiz, as a witness called by the plaintiff, testifies that  \"the only thing which he knows is that said properties were attached by the Filipino government, but he does not know whether or not Mariano Abella took possession of the same.\" The plaintiff introduced a letter dated November 21, 1898, in which the local chief of Iriga notified the resident provincial chief that on that very day he had released the deposit of the attached properties and had delivered the same to the agent of Abella. This letter having been introduced by the plaintiff we have the right to presume that it refers to the properties under consideration here. There is no proof whatever in any part of the record that Abella has ever ousted the plaintiff from these properties. <br/><br/>But the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has confessed the ouster in his answer, or has failed to deny the same. In view of the fact that such an admission is directly contrary to the evidence, we should not consider the same as made unless the answer clearly discloses such admission. It is true that he admitted clearly in his answer the possession of the defendant in the capacity of administrator, but this is not the question under consideration. Is it admitted that the plaintiff was ousted by the defendant?<br/><br/>The answer, after alleging that by virtue of the attachment levied by the Spanish Government these properties were usurped by the plaintiff, states:  \"And upon restoring to the heirs of the father of my client his property which had been attached there were delivered to him these properties.\" The use of the words  \"restore\" and  \"deliver\" in this clause can not be reconciled with the idea of a forcible ouster by the heirs of Señor Abella. These words clearly indicate that some third party intervened between Feced and Abella, depriving the former of the properties and delivering the same to the latter. This interpretation, as we have seen, is completely in accord with the facts as they have been established by the evidence. This clause is a sufficient denial of the ouster alleged in the complaint. For the foregoing reasons we decide:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tThat the summary writ of recovery lies only against the ousting party and not against a third person who has received the realty from the former; and<br/><br/>(2)\tThat the evidence in this case discloses that the defendant is not the ousting party. <br/><br/>The judgment, therefore, is reversed and the defendant absolved from the complaint without special ruling as to costs in either instance. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

Upon his appearing after a considerable period of time he stated that he ought not to render said public service because he had already made the rounds and that another should do it. Thereupon the lieutenant raised his stick to strike the defendant who in turn grasped his bolo, perhaps in order to defend himself, so that the flow then given was parried by the said weapon. The lieutenant then seized Rosario, in order to subdue him, with the assistance of two witnesses there present, one of whom tied him while the other took the bolo from him. <br/><br/>The act set forth does not constitute the crime of assault, or that of resisting an agent of the Government, and still less that of grave disobedience to the latter in the exercise of his authority, for the reason that the defendant seized the bolo which he carried in his belt in order to defend himself and for the purpose of parrying the blow given him by the agent of the Government — an instinctive act of defense against an unjustified assault. And as the defendant did not attack nor attempt to assault or intimidate the officer with said weapon — elements in the commission of the crime of assault defined and punished in articles 249 and 250 without which the said crime can not be deemed to exist — and as he did not disobey an order of the said officer (for the statement which has been relied upon can not be construed as disobedience) it is apparent that proof is lacking of the acts which constitute a crime and that the acts committed by the accused are not criminal or of a criminal character. The defendant must therefore be acquitted. <br/><br/>It follows that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the defendant acquitted with the costs of both instances de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, denying the petition of the appellant to raise to the formality of a public instrument (escritura) the open will of his deceased wife, Doña Dolores Garces. The will was executed without the services of a notary according to the provisions of articles 700 and 702 of the Civil Code relative to wills executed in articulo mortis. It was reduced to writing and signed by the testatrix and seven witnesses. The court denied the application upon the sole ground that it did not appear that the will had been executed by one single act. <br/><br/>Six of the witnesses to the will were examined by the judge, one witness having died before the hearing. All of the witnesses testified expressly that the will was executed by one single act. Concerning the hour when this execution took place all were not agreed. Four of them testified that it took place approximately between the hours of 6 and 7 of the evening. One testified that it occured at 3 o’clock of the afternoon and one that it was done during the time between 3 o’clock in the afternoon and 8 o’clock in the evening, approximately. <br/><br/>The judge deemed these statements, apparently contradictory, concerning the hour when the will was made, as destructive of the force of credibility of the unanimous statement of all of the witnesses to the effect that the will was executed in one single act. We do not so consider the aforesaid statements. The four witnesses who testified that the execution took place between 6 and 7 might have referred only — as is reasonable to suppose — to the formal act of executing the same, or, in other words, to the final reading of the document to the testatrix in the presence of the witnesses, the manifestation by the testatrix of her approval of the same, and the act of signing by the testatrix and the witnesses, which acts naturally would not consume more than a short time. On the other hand, the witness who testified that the execution took place during the period from 3 to 8 might have understood that the execution included all of the procedure, drawing up the will in writing, and including all that was done with reference to the same preparatory to the final formalities. The execution, in this sense, might easily have lasted several hours as the witness stated. The last witness, who testified that the execution took place at 3 might have had in mind the first step in the process of the execution, using the term in this last sense. Thus explained the testimony of all of the witnesses is found to agree in the essential particulars and we are inclined to believe that this interpretation is the true one. Even though it were impossible to reconcile the different statements in question, we would not be disposed to give to a contradiction of this sort, which is upon a merely accessory circumstance, the weight that has been given thereto by the lower court. <br/><br/>We believe that the due execution of the will was sufficiently proved. <br/><br/>And therefore the order appealed from should be reversed and the document which appears in the record is declared the will of the deceased, Doña Dolores Garces, verified by the witnesses, it being understood that this declaration is without prejudice to third persons. The said will is ordered to be inscribed in the proper notarial record or protocol. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The four plaintiffs brought their respective actions against the resolution passed by the Intendencia General de Hacienda of the former Spanish Government in a decree of August 21, 1895, for the reason that the fine of 20 per cent upon the owners of the contraband silver found aboard the steamer Don Juan was made applicable to that part of the silver which was not circulating Mexican currency in the manner prescribed in said decree; and for the reason that the other plaintiffs, Medina, Madariaga, and Garcia Gutierrez were denied recognition as the captors of said silver and were consequently denied the right to a share of the fine imposed by the Intendencia General. <br/><br/>The several complaints have been drawn up in accordance with the special act which controls the maintenance of an action of administrative contention. By order of May 9, 1896, affirmed by order of March 26, 1897, it was directed that the four actions be consolidated. To these complaints the Attorney-General made answer praying the confirmation of the decree complained of. The action having proceeded according to the due course of law, the written discussion was declared at an end and the period of proofs concluded by order of May 1 of the same year (1897). Subsequently by a further order of the 11th of the same month the parties were ordered to be cited for a decision, together with the setting of a day for the trial. This was the status of the litigation upon the dissolution of the Spanish tribunal which had jurisdiction over the same. The matter was then placed upon the calendar of this court for the setting of a day for trial. Thereupon Attorney J. B. Early appeared on behalf of Don Antonio Iribar and Messrs. Early &amp; Levering on behalf of the Chinaman Sy Guian and demanded that there be paid to Iribar the third part, or such other portion as the law awarded, of the silver moneys and other properties salved from the wreck of the steamer Don Juan by said Iribar, who was captain of the steamer San Antonio, which effected the salvage of the burned steamer together with its passengers and cargo, and that there be paid to the Chinaman Sy Guian, owner and manager of the steamer San Antonio, that portion of the valuables and effects salved which belonged to him for the expenses of the salvage. <br/><br/>The 25th day of February last having been designated for the hearing of this action, on the 10th day of said month the attorneys Montagne &amp; Dominguez, and the Attorney-General presented a writing setting forth that it had been agreed that the plaintiffs Messrs. Millat, Marty &amp; Mitjans should desist from the action pending against the above-mentioned resolution so far as the same concerned themselves, and the said attorneys for that reason moved that the same be deemed dismissed on behalf of their clients and that the resolution of the defunct Intendencia General be declared final and its execution be ordered. <br/><br/>For the purpose of this motion a hearing was had on February 11, and at that hearing the attorneys, Montagne &amp; Dominquez be denied and that the stipulation made in the name of Millat, Marty &amp; Mitjans be disregarded for the reason that Iribar had a right to the one-third part at least of the silver which was salved, and the Chinaman Sy Guian, as owner of the steamer San Antonio, likewise had a right to recover the expenses incurred in the salvage and to collect salvage money according to law. <br/><br/>Whatever may be the rights which the captain of the steamer San Antonio, Don Antonio Iribar, and the Chinaman Sy Guian, as owner of this steamer, have respectively for the salvage of the destroyed steamer Don Juan, the action which accrues in favor of each of them should be litigated in a suit which lies in first instance and in no wise in this court, especially not in a suit in the nature of a contentious-administrative action. <br/><br/>There exists no law, either general or special, which confers jurisdiction upon this court under which it can take cognizance as a court of first instance of the questions raised by reason of the salvage of a vessel destroyed by fire and of the expenses incurred by the salvage of the same and of her cargo and passengers. <br/><br/>The actions which might have accrued to the aforesaid Iribar and Sy Guian do not partake of the nature of contentious-administrative proceedings, nor can they be sustained, in view of the character of the same, in accordance with the legal procedure provided for a contentious administrative suit. Article 4 of the law of November 23, 1888, provides conclusively that questions of a civil or criminal character appertaining to the ordinary jurisdiction or to other special jurisdictions are questions which, among others, are not within the cognizance of the contentious-administrative courts; and it is apparent at first sight that the questions which may be raised by the claims made incidentally by the representatives of Iribar and Sy Guian are of a civil nature, inasmuch as the respective rights which are supposed to have been violated are of such character. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the aforesaid Iribar and Sy Guian are not parties, and have never been parties, to the present contentious-administrative suit, since they have filed neither appeal nor complaint, nor have they intervened in any manner in this suit during its entire course from its commencement until the same was closed for the hearing. For this reason there is no legal ground upon which the court may accede to the demands of the said parties, or even take the same into consideration in the decision which will be made at the proper time. <br/><br/>With reference to the petition made by the attorneys Montagne &amp; Dominguez in the name of Messrs. Millat, Marty &amp; Mitjans, dismissing the action and the complaint interposed against the above-mentioned decree of the defunct Intendencia General de Hacienda, and asking for the execution of said decree, with which said petition the Attorney-General agrees, no objection is offered to the granting of the same. The provisions of the law concerning administrative contentions do not prohibit nor are they opposed to the dismissal of an action or complaint filed in accordance with the same, neither do the general provisions of the Law of Civil Procedure, which controls as the law supplementary to the legislation concerning administrative contentions prohibit the parties from desisting from the prosecution of the complaints, claims, or actions they have interposed. On the contrary, expressly authorizing the same, they provide that after certain proceedings had, such dismissals shall be admitted and the suit deemed at an end. <br/><br/>Therefore, by virtue of the foregoing considerations the representatives of Messrs. Millat, Marty &amp; Mitjans must be deemed to have withdrawn from the prosecution of the complaint filed against the resolution made in the decree of August 21, 1895, by the Intendencia General de Hacienda of the former Spanish Government, and it is so decided, with the one-fourth part of the costs incurred in the suit up to folio 488 and those by them or for them incurred subsequent to said point taxed against the said representatives; the motion of counsel for Don Antonio Iribar and the Chinaman Sy Guian is denied, with the costs of the motion taxed against the said parties; and it is directed that this proceeding be called at the next general term in order that it may be set for trial and hearing be had. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

Two men, called Fabian and Tolome, now deceased, presented themselves, apparently unarmed. After entering the hut they drew their bolos, bound the said Banson, and compelled him to go with them. Upon reaching a point near the fields of said Banson where five servants of his were working, the two kidnappers forced the said servants to proceed with them. At that point the defendant joined them, appearing from behind a knoll where he had concealed himself. Upon so appearing he exclaimed, according to one witness:  \"It was written that you were to fall in my power;\" according to antoher witness:  \"Thanks be given that I have caught you, now you are in my hands;\" according to another  \"Thanks be given that you have fallen into my power.\" The defendant then beat him with the butt of a gun which he carried until they arrived at a place called Bulutong where he made the five servants place themselves in single file and ordered Don Julio to kneel before them and maltreated the latter brutally, saying:  \"Give me the amount of the cedula which you collected; now you will pay me for the blows which I received in the tribunal.\" Not satisfied with torturing the deceased by himself he ordered Tolome to give him a blow upon the chest with a bolo. Don Julio begging for mercy, the defendant sent one of the servants to the wife of the deceased to ask for $1,000 for his ransom. After the servant had been sent all were led to a place called Cosme and upon arriving there the defendant ordered Fabian and Tolome to conduct Don Julio to a ditch. At the same time the witness and his three companions were given their liberty by the defendant, who remained with his two companions and with Don Julio. Don Julio was never afterwards seen alive and his headless body was found two or three days later in this same place. <br/><br/>No eyewitness has testified to the killing of Banson by the defendant, but the violent death of the former is proved, and that the defendant is responsible for such death as principal admits of no reasonable doubt. In conformity with an apparently preconceived plan, Banson was violently taken from his house by two armed servants or dependents of the defendant; he was bound and cruelly wounded and beaten by the defendant and his henchmen at his order, and he was taken by the defendant to the place where a few days later his headless body was found. This evidence is sufficient to convict the defendant as principal. <br/><br/>From the evidence there appears the qualifying circumstance of treachery. To show this it is only necessary to mention the fact that the deceased was bound. There is present also the generic circumstance No. 6 of article 10. The evidence shows that the defendant was beaten into a state of almost insensibility, not with the intention of then killing him but to cause him unnecessary suffering as a preliminary to the killing. There is present also the twelfth generic circumstance of article 10, proved by the fact that the deceased, a land owner, was forced to kneel in front of his four servants drawn up in line before him. <br/><br/>The writer of this decision is also of the opinion that there is present the seventh generic circumstance, article 10, that of  \"acting with known premeditation.\" But it is not necessary to so decide as the two other circumstances raise the penalty to the maximum grade. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated the judgment of the court below is reversed and we adjudge that the defendant is guilty of the crime of murder with the sixth and twelfth aggravating circumstances of article 10 of the Penal Code, and we condemn him to the penalty of death with indemnification of $1,000 to the widow and heirs of the deceased and with costs of both instances. In case of the non-execution of the penalty imposed through the pardon of the accused, it shall then be understood that he is condemned to perpetual absolute disqualification and subjected to the vigilance of the authorities during his life, unless these accessory penalties be specially remitted by executive clemency. <br/><br/>The case is remanded to the court below with instructions to proceed therein in accordance with law. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

But when Juana appeared at said door with a light one of the men ordered her to extinguish it or the Americans with them would kill her. She then noticed that her husband had been bound and heard one of the strangers say to him that by order of the American garrison at Alcala they were to conduct him to Peña Blanca in connection with some affair concerning one Badajo. She recognized Nicolas Ancheta as one of the three men who kidnaped her husband — the very one who threatened her — by his voice, height, and walk. They had their faces covered with their handkerchiefs. Some were armed with daggers and bolos. Terrified, she fled from the house and hid herself at some distance away. Upon her return the following morning she did not find her husband at home and at once reported the occurrence to the authorities. <br/><br/>When the municipal president, who was also justice of the peace of that township, made the necessary investigation, the seven defendants were taken into custody and before the justice of the peace, his secretary, the commanding military officer of Alcala, and other persons, they confessed that they had conducted the kidnaped man, Ventura Quinto, to a place called Radap, within the confines of the same township, and that there, by order of Nicolas Ancheta and Sebastian Dayag, he was killed by Faustino Pascual, Daniel Verson, and Aniceto Javier. The latter held an end of the cord with which Ventura was bound and secured, while Nicolas Ancheta, Sebastian Dayag, Claro Ancheta, and Maximo Verson posted themselves at some distance to watch for the approach of anyone, in order to prevent the discovery of the crime. The local authorities found the body of the deceased in a hole some 2 meters deep, near Radap, at the place designated by the accused. The body was in a state of complete decomposition and hence the practitioner who made the examination was unable to determine the number of the wounds, although he noted that both elbows were tied from behind with strips of rattan and that the abdomen had been ripped open. In addition to this the dagger and bolo were discovered in the place pointed out by the defendants Nicolas and Faustino. All these facts were confirmed by the defendants in their testimony. <br/><br/>A complaint having been filed by the public prosecutor and the defendants arraigned they pleaded  \"not guilty.\" At the trial the municipal president testified that in his opinion Ventura Quinto was killed as an act of vengeance on the part of Dayag, who has been ill treated the year before by the deceased. Furthermore, he believed that the defendants bore resentment against the deceased because the latter, by order of the witness, had arrested the bandit Jose Badajo, who was suspected of belonging to the defendant’s band. Two expert armorers testified that they were unable to ascertain if the spots noted on the dagger and bolo were or were not of blood; and that the dagger was of a kind whose use was prohibited, but not the bolo. <br/><br/>The foregoing facts, fully proved at the trial by ocular inspection, expert testimony, the declarations of credible witnesses, and by grave and conclusive circumstantial evidence, constitute the crime of murder, prohibited and penalized in article 403 of the Penal Code. The execution of the crime was attended with the qualificative circumstance of treachery (alevosia), in that the defendants, in killing Ventura Quinto while he was bound elbow to elbow, employed means tending directly and particularly to insure the consummation of the crime without risk to the aggressors, inasmuch as thus bound and disarmed the victim could not defend himself in any manner against the seven men who kidnapped him or even against the three who actively participated in his killing. <br/><br/>The criminal responsibility of the defendants as perpetrators of the murder which is here prosecuted is beyond question, inasmuch as all of them by previously concerted action met together and witnessed the capture and later the violent killing of Ventura Quinto. Some took a direct part in the actual commission of the crime, others were the determined instigators who induced the former to commit it, while the remainder cooperated in the same by their presence and by means of acts without which the crime would not have been perpetrated. It must be taken into account that this murder was committed by a gang (cuadrilla) of seven persons, the greater part of whom were armed, and it does not appear that any of those present who were not active participants in the crime made any effort to prevent it. This latter conclusion is not affected by the unfounded allegations made by the defendants, since they inculpate each other mutually in confessing their participation and cooperation in the said murder and since it is proven that all of the four who were not the actual perpetrators thereof witnessed the commission of the crime, lending to the murderers their moral support, all are thus directly responsible for the consequences and incidents of the same. <br/><br/>In the commission of this murder there is to be considered, according to the facts adduced at the trial, the presence of the fifteenth aggravating circumstance of article 10 of the Code, affecting all seven of the defendants in that they committed the crime at night, in an uninhabited place, and in a band (en cuadrilla). These three incidents are considered, according to the decisions of the courts, as one single circumstance for the purpose of increasing the penalty of the crime. Likewise there is to be considered the presence of the seventh circumstance of the same article 10 as applicable to the defendants Nicolas Ancheta and Sebastian Dayag for the reason that these two conceived the idea and premeditated the killing of Quinto, induced the others to kidnap him in order that he might be put to death, and ordered the three to kill him. In addition, we must consider the presence of the eight aggravating circumstance of said article of the Code as applicable to Faustino Pascual, Daniel Verson, Aniceto Javier, and said Nicolas Ancheta for the reason that they employed both disguise and fraud, covering their faces with handkerchiefs while effecting the capture of their victim to avoid being recognized and making him believe by deceit that they would conduct him to another place at the order of the commander of the American detachment at Alcala. With respect to all the defendants the only mitigating circumstance in their favor which can be applied to offset the first aggravating circumstance is that especially established in article 11 of the Penal Code, which, in view of the class to which the defendants belong, may be applied in their favor for the reduction of the penalty. It follows that even regarding the fifteenth aggravating circumstance as compensated by the mitigating circumstance of article 11, still circumstances 7 and 8 article 10 of the Code must be applied, and to them we must add the twenty-fourth of the same article, because the murderers made use of a dagger — a weapon prohibited by the regulations. <br/><br/>The crime here prosecuted being thus defined by the circumstances already enumerated, it is apparent that the penalty prescribed in article 403 of the Penal Code should be imposed upon the five defendants, Nicolas Ancheta, Sebastian Dayag, Faustino Pascual, Daniel Verson, and Aniceto Javier in its maximum grade, and upon the remaining two, Claro Ancheta and Maximo Verson, in its medium grade, with the corresponding accessory penalties. <br/><br/>Furthermore, in view of the nature and circumstance of the murder for which this cause is prosecuted it is evident that the fact that the deceased was captured in his house and taken by the defendants to an uninhabited place selected by them for the purpose of killing him there, does not constitute the crime of illegal detention, since it does not appear that it was the purpose of the accused to commit this offense. On the contrary, they seized the unfortunate Quinto in his house with the sole object of carrying him away to a suitable place, which they subsequently pointed out to the authorities, and of there murdering him. <br/><br/>Concerning the petition for the annulment of the judgment reviewed presented on appeal by the Solicitor-General, and based on the ground that the same was made by a judge who should have retired on June 16, 1901, this question has been previously determined by the court, upon a similar motion of the Solicitor-General, in its decision dated November 16, 1901, in a case of grave assault (lesiones graves) from Ilocos Sur, register No. 412, and reported elsewhere. In that opinion the validity of the proceedings and of the judgment was sustained and the court’s decision upon this point is referred to and applied in this cause. <br/><br/>Therefore, for the reasons above stated, it is meet in justice and in accordance with the provisions of the penal law that the defendants Nicolas Ancheta, Sebastian Dayag, Faustino Pascual, Aniceto Javier, and Daniel Verson, be condemned to the death penalty, to be executed in the township of Amulung, Cagayan, Island of Luzon, and if they should be pardoned from such penalty it shall likewise be understood that they are condemned to absolute and perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for the lifetime of each one of the defendants unless the said accessory penalties be especially remitted in such pardon. The remaining defendants, Maximo Verson and Claro Ancheta, shall be sentenced to the penalty of life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) and to the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the respective lives of the culprits and in case the said defendants should obtain a pardon of the principal penalty they shall suffer those of absolute and perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the lifetime of each one of the defendants unless the same shall be expressly remitted in the pardon of the principal penalty. All of the seven defendants shall be sentenced to pay pro rata and in solidum an indemnity of 1,000 pesos, Mexican currency, to the widow and heirs of the deceased and to pay a seventh part of the costs of both instances. The arms seized are declared forfeited. The judgment reviewed is therefore confirmed in so far as it agrees with the foregoing decision and reversed in so far as it conflicts therewith. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, dissents. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Article 452 of the Penal Code is as follows:  \"Calumny is the false imputation of an offense which gives rise to official proceedings\" (procedimiento de oficio). <br/><br/>The crime of which the complaining witness was accused was that of cutting timber upon public lands in the Island of Negros and the importation thereof into Iloilo without the payment of fees. The imputation, if true, would have made him liable to a fine according to the provisions of General Orders, No. 92, series of 1900. <br/><br/>The royal decree of November 13, 1884, put in force in the Philippines the  \"final regulations for the government of the forestry bureau of the Philippines.\" The said decree was promulgated in Manila on January 5, 1885, and published in the Manila Gazette on the 23d of the same month and year. The violation of these regulations are punished by a fine, and article 95 of the same provides that these fines shall be imposed by the governor in chief, by the general board of civil administration, or by the governor-general, according to the amount of the fine. There was no recourse before the courts of justice aside from two cases which have no connection with that and are not in point. The penalty was imposed and enforced in a purely administrative manner. There was no penalty other than administrative fines. <br/><br/>The General Order above cited conforms to this royal decree. It does not prescribe that the collection of the fines incurred should be made by judicial process. they should be collected, and indeed they have always been collected, by the bureau of forestry. <br/><br/>The question which must be decided is this: Do the violations of said General Order  \"give rise to official proceedings (de oficio)\" within the meaning of said article 452? Certain crimes, such, for example, as adultery, are prosecuted only upon the complaint of the aggrieved party. it was with the object of excluding this class of cases that the words de oficio were employed. <br/><br/>The same phrase appears in article 326, which states as follows:  \"The crime of false accusation or denunciation is committed by imputing falsely to anyone acts which if true would constitute a crime of the class which give rise to an official proceeding if this imputation were made before an administrative or judicial officer who by reason of his office should proceed to verify or punish the same. <br/><br/>\"Nevertheless proceedings shall not be commenced against the denouncer or accuser except by virtue of a final judgment or final order of dismissal of the court which should have jurisdiction of the imputed offense. <br/><br/>\"The latter(court) shall order official proceedings to be commenced against the denouncer or accuser whenever it appears from the principal cause that there are sufficient grounds for commencing the new proceedings.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It is certain that the text is confined to judicial proceedings notwithstanding the use of the word  \"administrative\" (administrativo), since it provides conclusively that the accuser shall not be proceeded against until the court which should have jurisdiction of the crimes shall have dictated an order of dismissal. If the defendant Keay had been proceeded against in accordance with this article instead of article 452 and it should have been proved that his accusation after an investigation by the bureau of forestry was false and a final order of dismissal should have been dictated by the chief of said bureau he could not have been convicted. The bureau of forestry would have had the right to investigate and to punish the act, but the case would have lacked the essential element of a judgment of a judicial tribunal declaring the accusation to be unfounded. <br/><br/>These two articles are very similar. So far as the imputation is concerned this is the same in both. They differ with reference to the person to whom the said imputation is communicated. There are no reasons, therefore, why the phrase procedimientos de oficio should be interpreted in article 452 in a sense different from that which should be given the same in article 326. We are therefore of the opinion that a person can not be convicted in accordance with the former article unless the imputation constitutes a crime punishable before the courts of justice. <br/><br/>Having arrived at this conclusion we have not deemed it necessary to analyze the grounds upon which the trial court based its decision. The judgment appealed from is affirmed and the defendant is acquitted with costs of both instances taxed officially. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant, Mariano Ricafor, was declared guilty by the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan of the crime of assassination committed without any generic circumstance qualifying the criminal responsibility and was sentenced to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua). The cause is brought up to this court for review. The Solicitor-General concurred with the judgment of the trial court and asked that the same be affirmed. <br/><br/>It appears from the evidence that on the night of a certain Friday in the month of March, 1900, the defendant and Gabino Marquez, in company with Clemente Oli, Marcos Nares, and Cornelio Tabajonda, went to the house of Pedro Lorioda, within the limits of Pozorrubio, Province of Pangasinan; that Oli, Nares, and Trabajonda, who it appears were asked or compelled to accompany the defendant and Marquez to enter the house; that the defendant and Marquez took possession of the two Loriodas and, still accompanied by Oli, Nares, and Tabajonda, conducted them to the fields of the barrio of Alipangpang within the confines of Pozorrubio and to a place in which there was a well. Upon arriving at this spot the defendant and Marquez bound their victims and killed them by inflicting wounds upon the neck with bolos, the defendant killing Pedro and Marquez Juan. They then threw the bodies into the well. <br/><br/>The abduction of the two Loriodas by removing them from the house is proved by the statement of five eyewitnesses, namely, Oli, Nares, Trabajonda, and the wife and daughter of Pedro Lorioda. The remaining facts are proved by the statements of Oli, Nares, and Trabajonda, who, if they are to be believed, went, as has been stated, from the house to the fields with the accused and Marquez after the abduction of the Loriodas, and they were present while the latter were bound and killed. It appears that these three individuals were accomplices in the commission of the crime, but as their statements were corroborated in large part — that is to say, with reference to what took place at the house — by other witnesses, and inasmuch as the latter were not impeached in any sense, and as we must presume that there was nothing in the manner of giving these statements at the trial which would affect their probability (General Orders, No. 58, art. 55), we are of the opinion that the same should be given absolute credence as was done by the trial court. <br/><br/>We attribute little importance to the fact that the motives for the crime were not disclosed. In this, as in almost every crime apparently without motive, the motives which might exist are innumerable — motives unknown perhaps to the relatives of the deceased who testified at the trial and not even disclosed to the three who cooperated in a certain measure in the crime. <br/><br/>The fact of having bound the murdered persons, inasmuch as it hindered their resistance or rendered it impossible and had for its direct and special object the assurance of the execution of the crime without personal risk to the defendant and Marquez, constitutes the qualifying circumstance of treachery, thus converting the homicide into assassination. <br/><br/>A majority of the court is of the opinion that the circumstance of premeditation should also be taken into account. the facts as they appear in the record and as set forth above are scanty but suffice to demonstrate the existence of a determined plan to commit the assassination conceived by the defendant and Marquez at the latest at the time of taking hold of the Loriodas and starting with them for the place where the crime was committed. It does not appear what time elapsed between the effecting of the abduction at the house and the arrival of the captors with their victims at the well, but it is to be supposed that the time was sufficient, in the language of the supreme court of Spain, for the  \"conscience to conquer the determination of the will.\" (Opinion of November 10, 1894.) Then followed the operation of binding the deceased, affording a new opportunity for reflection upon the crime which the defendant was about to commit. In a judicial sense we believe that there was a complete opportunity for meditation and reflection, just as much as if days or weeks had elapsed between the forming of the plan and its execution. <br/><br/>It is true that the premeditation which the law prescribes must be  \"evident\" — that is, must be based upon external acts and not presumed from the mere lapse of time. We do not doubt that such external acts exist in this case. In the first place there was the deceit practiced in order to obtain possession of the persons of the murdered men; then came the abduction, followed by the conveyance of the deceased to the place where the crime was committed — a place (and this is in our opinion a very significant circumstance) which lent itself to the execution of the crime with respect to the concealment of the bodies — and after that the binding of the victims, which could not have been done with any other object than that of facilitating and assuring the commission of the crime. If all these acts, which evidently form part of a single design, directed from the beginning to the end to the realization of the same final result, would not constitute reflective meditation in the judicial sense, there would then be very few cases of this character in which it would be possible to deduce the existence of the external manifestations of the mental functions in human conduct. Any interpretation of the acts of the defendant to which we have referred excluding the idea of premeditation we do not conceive to be convincing. (See the opinion of Justice Willard in the cause of the United States v. Teodoro de Leon, supra. 1)<br/><br/>A majority of the court being of the opinion that the defendant is guilty of the crime of assassination committed with the aggravating circumstance of premeditation, without any extenuating circumstance, and it being our opinion that there should not be considered as an extenuating circumstance in favor of the culprit the circumstance of race as established in article 11 of the Code, in view of the nature of the crime and the conditions of the defendant, the sentence of the court below is annulled and the defendant condemned to the penalty of death and to the payment of an indemnity of 1,000 pesos, Mexican currency, to the widow and heir of Pedro Lorioda, and in the event that this sentence be not carried out by reason of the pardon of the defendant, to the accessory penalties of perpetual, absolute disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during his life, unless said penalties are expressly included in the pardon. Let the cause be remanded to the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan for the execution of this sentence.

From this judgment appeal has been taken to this court. <br/><br/>The plaintiffs, as grounds for a decree annulling and canceling the will referred to, allege that the notarial authority of Señor Salamante, before whom the will was executed, was created by royal decree, with the town of Pasig as the place of his residence; that the will was executed before Señor Salamante in the city of Manila and was null and of no force or effect, since the act was performed outside of the jurisdiction of the notary. <br/><br/>By royal decree of February 15, 1889, the notarial law of May 28, 1862, prevailing in the Peninsula (Spain) was put in force in the Philippines with certain modifications and was to go into effect on July 1, 1889. Article 3 of this notarial law provides that the office of notary shall include the territorial limits of the judicial districts in which the same were established. <br/><br/>Tondo was in the judicial district of which the town of Pasig formed a part and Señor Salamante had authority to authenticate the execution of the will in the city of Manila. Therefore the contest of the will of Doña Fernanda Trinidad can not be sustained. <br/><br/>The other grounds of nullity alleged by the plaintiffs, with respect to the execution of the will, refer to formalities of little importance which do not affect its validity; and furthermore, the greater part of them are not in conformity with the facts as they appear in the record. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed, with costs of this appeal taxed against the appellants. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The court is not agreed upon the merits of this case. We are all agreed that the amended complaint is insufficient and that the judgment must be reversed for that reason. We differ as to whether this defect should be disregarded and the defendant acquitted. <br/><br/>The amended complaint was presented on the 13th day of November, 1900, and in its substantial part it is as follows: The undersigned accuses Francisco Enriquez, defendant in cause No. 82, of the crime of embezzlement (estafa), committed as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The said Francisco Enriquez on the 20th day of November, 1897, in Manila, Province of Manila, appropriated to himself the sum of $4,243, an amount received by Francisco Enriquez in the capacity of agent, to the prejudice of his brothers, Don Rafael, Don Antonio, etc., from whom he lived separately, contrary to the statute in such case made and provided. <br/><br/>To this amended complaint the defendant demurred. The demurrer was overruled and he was placed upon trial and convicted of appropriating $4,243 found to have been received by him as agent of his father; $1,000 on September 13, 1883, and the balance on December 24, 1883. <br/><br/>The money was found to have been received by him as part of the purchase price of the house No. 2, in Calle Fundicion, Intramuros. <br/><br/>One purpose of a complaint is to notify the defendant of the transaction from which it is claimed the crime results, so that he can prepare his defense. If, after reading the complaint, he, being a man of  \"common understanding,\" can not tell to what acts of his done in the past the complaint refers, it is insufficient. <br/><br/>In this complaint the estafa is alleged to have been committed on November 20, 1897. Time, however, was not a material ingredient in the offense of estafa here charged, and under the provisions of article 7 of General Orders, No. 58, that date need not have been alleged. When the date is not a material ingredient of the crime it alone furnishes, as a general rule, no means of determining what the transaction is to which the complaint refers. everyone performs a great many acts in a single day. Which one of these acts is marked by the complaint as criminal must be identified in some other way than by the date. That is well illustrated by this case. It appears that this date, November 20, 1897, is the date of the inventory which the defendant presented as executor of the estate of his parents. His failure to include in this inventory the sum above referred to is alleged to have constituted the estafa. How could this date give the defendant any clue as to what act of his in connection with this inventory was charged as criminal, even assuming that he knew that this was the date of the inventory, and that it was the presentation of this inventory and not any other act of his committed on that day to which reference was had?<br/><br/>But it may be said that the amount appropriated is given, to wit, $4,243. That amount, however, described nothing. There is no way of knowing what $4,243 is mentioned. It appears from this inventory that he received over $220,000. Under this complaint he could have been tried for the embezzlement of any $4,243 included in that sum. <br/><br/>Besides all this, as a general rule the amount named is not descriptive of the offense, and the defendant can be convicted if the evidence shows a smaller amount embezzled. <br/><br/>The complaint does not show of whom he was agent. We do not see why, if this complaint is sufficient, he could not have been tried for appropriating, in November, 1897, any sum less than $4,243 received from anyone by him as agent, provided it was shown that Don Rafael and Don Antonio Enriquez were prejudiced. In fact, this last statement is really the only thing which identifies the transaction. <br/><br/>If the defendant, on reading the complaint, had surmised that it referred to the sale in 1883 of this house on Calle Fundicion and had prepared his evidence to meet that charge, we see nothing that would have prevented the Government, when the case was called for trial, from proving a case entirely foreign to that transaction; as, for example, that on or about November 20, 1897, A. had paid the defendant about $4,200, which the latter had received as a deposit with the duty of paying it to Don Rafael and Don Antonio. <br/><br/>It is plain that the complaint did not restrict the Government to proof of any defined specific transaction, and consequently that the defendant had no notice of the transaction which was to be investigated. <br/><br/>In view of a new trial, it is proper to say that the letter of May 9, 1883, and the receipt of September 13, 1883, have, if genuine, an important bearing on the questions involved. Some proof of the authenticity of these documents should be made. The testimony of Cajigas is important. The accounts of his guardianship, if he presented any, should be produced for the purpose of corroborating or disproving his statements that he paid these sums in question at the date named. <br/><br/>For the reasons before stated the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the court below with instructions to that court to direct the filing of a new complaint or information against the defendant. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an action brought by Pedro Martinez Ilustre, the son and the compulsory legal heir, against Francisco Martinez Garcia for a declaration of prodigality against the father. <br/><br/>The allegations in the complaint are substantially: That Don Francisco Martinez, owing to his advanced age, is dissipating and squandering his estate by making donations to his second wife, Doña Anastacia Ilustre, and to her parents of properties amounting to over $200,000; that he has given over the administration of this estate to the management of his wife; that the defendant has a propensity for litigation and has instituted groundless actions against the plaintiff in order to take possession of the property held in common with the plaintiff to give it to his wife and her relatives. <br/><br/>In a supplementary prayer plaintiff asked the court to direct that the complaint be entered in the property register of the province, which was done by order of the court. <br/><br/>The defendant in his answer denies the allegations in the complaint and sets forth a state of facts quite inconsistent with those alleged in the complaint. <br/><br/>Among other things, it is stated that he has executed in favor of the plaintiff a general power of attorney under which the plaintiff has administered the community estate for several years; that the plaintiff has caused the ships Germana, Don Francisco, and Balayan, belonging to the estate, to be registered in his own name without the consent of the father and is otherwise mismanaging and misappropriating the property of the estate, which caused the defendant to revoke the power of attorney given to plaintiff, and that the suit brought by the defendant against the plaintiff was due to the attitude of the son, who, notwithstanding the fact that the power of attorney had been revoked, refused to render an account of his administration. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance rendered judgment against the plaintiff and adjudged the costs against him. The plaintiff has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>The acts which constitute prodigality are not defined in the Civil Code owing to the difficulty of applying general rules to the varying circumstances of the case and the different situations of persons. <br/><br/>The declaration of prodigality must be made in an ordinary action (en juicio contradictorio). (Art. 221 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>The proceedings must be instituted by the consort or the forced heirs. (Art. 222 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>Under our law it may be inferred that the acts of prodigality must show a morbid state of mind and a disposition to spend, waste, and lessen the estate to such an extent as is likely to expose the family to want of support, or to deprive the forced heirs of their undisposable part of the estate. <br/><br/>Donations are considered as acts of liberality dictated by generosity and affection. All persons who can contract and dispose of property may make donations. (Art. 624 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>Donations may comprise all the actual property of the donor, except such as is required for the support of the donor in a condition corresponding to his circumstances. (Art. 634 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>And with further limitation that no person can give by a donation more than what he can give by testament. <br/><br/>A donation is considered inofficious in all that exceeds such limits. (Art. 636 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>Public policy requires that limitations of the character mentioned should be imposed upon the owner, but a law which would impose restrictions further than such as are required by public policy may well be regarded unjust and tending in a contrary direction, as destroying the incentive to acquire property, and as subduing the generous impulse of the heart. <br/><br/>Beyond these limitations the law does not attempt to adjust claims to generosity. <br/><br/>There were a number of witnesses introduced both by the plaintiff and by the defendant whose testimony it is unnecessary to recount. <br/><br/>The testimony on the part of the plaintiff was wholly insufficient to support the allegations of his complaint. It was vague, indefinite, and of an inconclusive nature. <br/><br/>The father’s estate consisted of city property in Manila; of farms and of certain vessels, two of which are steamships. There is no evidence offered to show any transfers by sale or mortgage of these properties. This could have been easily done if such existed. Donations of real property must be made in a public deed (Art. 633 of the Civil Code), and the acquisition of vessels must also be included in a written instrument, and produces no effect with regard to third persons if not recorded in the Commercial Registry. (Art. 573 of the Code of Commerce.) <br/><br/>There is no proof that there was any money belonging to the estate, or other personal property, the transfer of which could not be easily traced. <br/><br/>The son has been in possession of a greater part of the estate since November, 1897, collecting the revenue from the ships and rents from the city property. <br/><br/>The farms have been nonproductive on account of the disturbed conditions of the country, and the revenue from even these has been in part collected by the son. <br/><br/>While some of the witnesses state that the possessions of the wife have greatly increased since her marriage, there is no evidence whatever to show that there has been any perceptible diminution of the defendant’s property. This can be accounted for only on the grounds that the father, so far from being a prodigal, is still in the full exercise of his faculties and still possesses the industry, thrift, and ability that resulted in the accumulation of a splendid estate after the date of his marriage with the mother of the plaintiff, to one-half of which estate the plaintiff has succeeded as heir of the mother. <br/><br/>A careful consideration of the evidence is sufficient to induce the belief that the plaintiff himself possesses that propensity for instituting lawsuits which he unjustly attributes to his father. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed and costs of suits in both courts is adjudged against the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The complainant introduced no evidence in the trial in support of the charge. The only testimony taken at the trial was that of the defendant Payog, which constitutes the only data upon which we must decide this case. <br/><br/>From this testimony it appears that while Payog was in the forest one day he found a little girl who was all alone, and who told him that her people, the Negritos, had refused to care for her. He therefore took charge of her and brought her to Manila for the purpose of delivering her to some person who might care for and support her, he being very poor and without means to do so himself, and that he did deliver the little girl to Santiago Barcelona, who on this account gave him the sum of 55 pesos as a present. The participation of the other defendant, Domingo Garcia, in the matter was limited solely, according to Payog, to accompanying him, at his request, to Barcelona’s house. <br/><br/>The court below, considering that the facts shown fall within the sanction of article 488 of the Penal Code above cited, rendered judgment condemning Payog to pay a fine of 325 pesetas, and Garcia to pay a fine of 3,250 pesetas, with the costs to each one of them in equal parts. Against this judgment Garcia appealed. Payog consented to the judgment. <br/><br/>Without determining the question as to whether the delivery of the girl by Payog to Santiago Barcelona, under the circumstances and for the reasons stated in his testimony, does or does not constitute the crime of abandonment of children, defined in the article above cited, as we do not consider it necessary in disposing of this case, we are of the opinion that the mere fact that Garcia accompanied Payog to Barcelona’s house is not in itself sufficient to make him responsible for the crime with which he is charged, whether Payog was guilty or not. It does not appear that when Garcia did this he had any knowledge of how or why it was that the girl in question was in Payog’s possession, nor consequently of any duty which Payog may have had with respect to the rearing and education of the girl. Among other cases which might be supposed it might very well be that the girl had been confided by her parents to Payog for the purpose of delivering her to Barcelona, in which case Payog’s action in so doing in accordance with this request would evidently not be punishable before the law. It is true that these were not the facts, but the accused, Garcia, was not obliged to know them, nor to investigate them for the purpose of doing what he did, which was simply to point out to Payog the house of Barcelona and accompany him thereto. In order to render him this service, which certainly was not in itself unlawful, he was under no obligation of knowing or finding out whether Payog was responsible in the technical sense of the Penal Code for the rearing and education of the girl in question, or whether he was under any other obligation to keep her in his custody; still less in view of the fact that it does not appear that Payog communicated to him the purpose for which he desired to see Barcelona when asking Garcia to accompany him to Barcelona’s house. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the judgment appealed must be reversed, and the accused, Domingo Garcia, acquitted, with the costs of this instance and one-half of the costs of the court below de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

No evidence was introduced for the defense. We think the conviction was right. <br/><br/>While the appeal was pending in this court the defendants presented a petition asking for the reopening of the trial under General Orders, No. 58, section 42, on the ground of newly discovered evidence material to their defense. This newly discovered evidence is to the effect that during the month of April, 1901, when the witnesses for the prosecution state that they saw the defendants with the caraballas in the outskirts of the pueblo, no persons except soldiers and the police were allowed by the military authorities to enter or leave the pueblo, and that if they did so it was at the risk of being shot by the patrols stationed around the pueblo. Without commenting upon the inconclusive character of this evidence, it is sufficient to say that the petition does not state any facts from which the court can infer that it is not owing to a lack of diligence that the evidence did not come to the knowledge of the defendants before the trial in the court below. The petition must therefore be denied, and the judgment is affirmed with the costs of this instance. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">We have been very much embarrassed in the decision of this cause on account of the condition of the record. It is evident that, although the suit was commenced in accordance with the Law of Civil Procedure, it was carried on, after the 1st day of October, 1901, in accordance with the procedural law now in force. The court below, however, in its last order, directed the making of a bill of exceptions, and ordered that the original record should be sent to this court. An examination of the record shows that it does not contain the proceedings at the trial. Nor does it appear what the evidence received and considered by the court below was, nor whether or not the plaintiff offered proofs in evidence which the judge refused to admit. Notwithstanding the defective condition of the record, the parties at the last term in Iloilo argued the case, limiting themselves by agreement to a discussion of the questions of law, excluding from the discussion all questions of fact. There was not, however, any agreement in respect to the facts upon which the questions of law were to be based. <br/><br/>Certain facts have, however, been admitted by the pleadings which appear in the record. It is admitted that the estate in question was rented under the contract which it attached to the complaint; that there existed on said estate a hydraulic mill for the grinding of sugar; that upon the 1st day of August, 1900, the municipality of Granada decided to close the canal which furnished water to the mill, on the alleged ground that said canal was dangerous to the public health. There is nothing to show whether or not the new canal which was opened by the defendant was a sufficient substitute for the old canal. In this condition of the record we can not decide whether the said act of the municipality of Granada is or is not sufficient ground for the rescission of the contract. The proof is not sufficient to enable us to determine whether or not the defendant had acquired by prescription the right to the enjoyment of the waters of the canal. <br/><br/>In accordance with the provisions of article 1554 of the Civil Code the landlord is bound to maintain the estate in proper condition for the use for which it has been rented. This provision requires the defendant to maintain the estate substantially, with reference to this mill, in the same condition as it was when the contract of lease was made. If the canal was closed by the municipality of Granada, acting in the exercise of its rights, the defendant, after having been so required, would be bound to furnish another canal as good as the old one, and if she failed to do so after such demand and the expiration of a reasonable time, the tenant would have a right to rescind the contract. <br/><br/>From what appears in the record the decision of the municipality of Granada can not be considered as a mere casual interference, and therefore within the terms of article 1560, since it does not appear in the record whether the council acted in the exercise of its rights or not. In the last case its action does not fall within the provisions of article 1560 by the express terms of the last clause. The parties have the right to present evidence upon the following points: (1) Did the council have, or not, the right to close the canal; and (2) Has the plaintiff furnished, or not, another canal as good as the old one?<br/><br/>The judge below made no decision concerning the right of the plaintiff to rescind the contract, and, as we understand, the judgment did not decide this question. It is inferred from the statement made by the lawyer for the defendant in his argument in this court that the evidence offered upon this point was excluded. If this is true, the court committed error. <br/><br/>The fact that the defendant has failed to furnish the thirty carts mentioned in the contract, if it is true, would not be ground for the rescission of the contract of lease, inasmuch as such omission only could affect the plaintiff with respect to the fulfillment of that part of the contract which was connected with the crop of 1899-1900, which crop was the property of the defendant. <br/><br/>The case having been carried on in the court below in accordance with the present Code, we think we are justified in applying to it the provisions of that Code so far as the judgment to be entered by this court is concerned. In accordance with that Code we have power to vacate a judgment and grant a new trial. (Art. 496.) In view of the fact that the judge ordered that the original record should be sent to this court without requiring the filing of a bill of exceptions, it would be a manifest injustice to hear the case upon this defective record and to enter a final judgment against the defendant rescinding the contract, when, if we had before us the evidence, it might turn out that no such judgment should be entered. The plaintiff ought not to get this advantage from his own failure to bring the record here in the proper condition. Moreover, the agreement of the parties to submit to the decision of the court questions of law raised in a suit carried on in accordance with the present Code ought to give us the right to enter a proper judgment for the determination of such questions in conformity with the provisions of said Code. <br/><br/>For these reasons it is ordered that the judgment of the court below be vacated and that the record be returned to the said court for a new trial, in which the parties will be able to present such evidence as they think proper. No order is made with regard to costs. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The evidence introduced in this case fully convinces the mind that the accused inflicted several wounds upon Ambrosio Macaraeg, who died shortly after in consequence thereof, and that the accused perpetrated the crime treacherously (alevosamente). <br/><br/>The court below classified the facts as constituting the crime of murder, and stated that the guilt of the accused as principals was proven, and that in the commission of the crime aggravating circumstance No. 20 of article 10 was present — that is, the commission of the crime in the dwelling house of the injured person. In consequence he condemned Fermin de la Cruz to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) and Juan Ramos and Bartolome Ramos to death by the garrote, taking into consideration the bad antecedents of the latter two. <br/><br/>Fermin de la Cruz not having appealed, the case was sent to this court in consultation of the judgment with respect to Juan Ramos and Bartolome Ramos only, in accordance with the provisions of the law applicable to the subject. <br/><br/>We consider that the classification of the crime as murder by the judge below is in accordance with law, as is also his conclusion as to the guilt of Juan and Bartolome Ramos. We do not, however, agree with the judge with respect to the penalty imposed upon them. In our opinion the circumstances which the judge considered for the purpose of imposing the death penalty should not be applied. <br/><br/>From the testimony of Luisa Macaraeg, the daughter of the deceased, the most important witness for the prosecution, it may be deduced that Macaraeg was attacked and wounded outside his house. She says that the accused called him out upon the deceitful pretest that they wanted to speak to him, and that, he having come down, they attacked him with the bolos they were carrying, inflicting upon him five wounds and leaving him stretched on the ground. This being so, and it not having been demonstrated that the place where the attack was made — it certainly was not in the house, which the accused did not enter — was connected with the house as an integral part thereof, it follows that the aggravating circumstance of the commission of the crime in the dwelling of the offended party can not properly be considered. <br/><br/>The bad antecedents of the accused do not constitute in themselves an aggravating circumstance, it not having been made to appear that they have been formerly punished for some crime or crimes, or could be regarded as recidivists under paragraphs 17 and 18 of article 10 of the Penal Code. Furthermore, the report of the municipality in which the Ramos brothers lived as to their manner of life and conduct solely states that it was middling — a vague expression which conveys no concrete idea and can not, therefore, be considered for the purpose of aggravating the penalty which the law requires should be inflicted upon these defendants. <br/><br/>As there is no circumstance connected with this case which modifies the penalty, the accused must be condemned to suffer the penalty prescribed by article 403 of the Penal Code in its medium grade, to wit, life imprisonment (cadena perpetua), in accordance with rule 1, article 81 of the Code. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the accused, Juan Ramos and Bartolome Ramos, must be condemned to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua), with its corresponding accessories, this punishment to be inflicted in the penal establishment provided by law to that end, and not in the provincial jail of Pangasinan. The judgment below is therefore reversed, in so far as it condemns the accused to death, but it is otherwise affirmed, with the costs of this instance to both the accused in equal parts. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

On the 3rd day of November of the same year judgment was ordered, directing Lerma to pay the plaintiff 2,334 pesos and 94 cents. The attachment was provisionally recorded in the register of property. <br/><br/>In this condition of the suit Doña Gregoria Martinez filed a claim in intervention as owner and as a person having a prior lien on the property. In the first of these she asked that there be excluded from the attachment those parts of the estate seized as the property of Lerma, and that it be declared that they belonged to her as owner, and that the attachment upon them be dissolved. By the second she asked that her claim of 4,520 pesos against Lerma be declared superior to the claim of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. <br/><br/>The court below admitted the intervention only in respect to the claim of preference, and as thus limited the complaint was served upon Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. The plaintiff thus impliedly agreed that her claim of ownership should be stricken out. The defendant admitted the facts stated in the complaint, except that part thereof in which it is stated that Lerma had renounced in favor of Doña Gregoria Martinez the property which constituted his paternal inheritance, because, in the document presented with the complaint, no such waiver is stated. This document says that Manuel Lerma, the defendant in the first action, was entitled to 4,374 pesos 43 3/8 cents as his share in his father’s estate; that he had received from his mother, the executrix, at different times, various amounts, so that at the date of the document there had been delivered to him 4,524 pesos; that is to say, 149 pesos and 56 5/8 cents in excess of his share. This document also says  \"that he acknowledges to have received prior to the execution of this instrument from Doña Gregoria Martinez y Bernardo, as executrix of the will of Don Jose Lerma y Lim, the sum of 4,374 pesos and 43 3/8 cents, the total amount of his hereditary portion, in cash, to his entire satisfaction, and the sum of 149 pesos and 56 5/8 cents loaned, also in cash, to his entire satisfaction, for which sums, amounting together to 4,524 pesos, evidenced by the above-mentioned receipts, the grantor hereby executes in favor of the said executrix the most binding and complete acquaintance necessary for her security, and in consequence acknowledges to have received his said share in the hereditary estate.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This is, in substance, all that the document contains. From it clearly appears that the only debt which is set up or claimed is a debt of 149 pesos and 56 5/8 cents. In respect to the remainder, the words of the document constitute, in express terms, the extinction of a debt. It is possible that the parties intended to accomplish something else, and were not fully informed of the legal effect of the document, but we can only consider that which the document expresses, and we hold that by it there is recognized a debt of only 149 pesos and 56 5/8 cents. <br/><br/>It is, however, still necessary to consider if, in respect to this sum, the plaintiff, Doña Gregoria, has a right, in the distribution of the value of the property in question, superior to the right of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. <br/><br/>The claim of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., the appellants, is a simple debt, evidenced by a promissory note. As such it had no preference over the other debts against the same debtor, and was included within the provisions of article 1925 of the Civil Code. While in this condition the claim of the appellee of 149 pesos had a preference over it, because her claim appeared in the public writing and fell within the provisions of article 1924, No. 3, of the same Code. Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. commenced an ordinary declarative action against the common debtor and obtained an embargo, which was levied on certain goods recorded in the register of property in the name of the debtor. This attachment was provisionally recorded in the same register. Did that record give them a preference which they did not have before over the debt of the appellee?<br/><br/>Article 1391 of the Law of Civil Procedure requires this proceeding, and article 42, No. 2, of the Mortgage Law allows it. Article 44 of the Mortgage Law declares what its effect is in the matter of preferences. This article is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The creditor who obtains in his favor a provisional record in the cases referred to in Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of article 42 will be preferred, in respect only to the property covered by the attachment, to those who may have against the same debtor another claim contracted after the said record.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>From the time when the Mortgage Law of 1861 was in consideration up to the present time there has been only one opinion concerning the effects of aprovisional record of this class. It has always been said that it did not change the character of the debt; that it did not convert into a right to the thing itself the claim of the creditor; that it did not give him any preference over existing claims which were not so provisionally recorded. <br/><br/>In the introduction to the Mortgage Law of 1861 the Commission says:  \"The judicial mortgages, which hereafter, under the projected law, will be known as provisional records (anotacion preventiva), are constituted solely for the purpose of insuring the success of a trial. They do not create any right, and still less do they convert into a right in rem a claim which did not have this character before. It can not be said of them that they are the prize for the racers, as has been stated in another nation, thus likening the desire of the creditors to overreach each other in obtaining the provisional record to the eagerness with which the first place at the end of a horse race is sought. They are not an unmerited favor granted to the most relentless creditor. They do not modify the character of obligations by changing simple into hypothecary obligations, nor do they make the judge an agent of the litigants, compelling him to make good the negligence of the creditor, and to give him securities which possibly the debtor himself at the time of assuming the obligation would not have given. The judicial mortgage, which has for its sole purpose that of insuring the results of a suit, has never had this character in Spain. It certainly has not created a mortgage action in favor of the creditor who has succeeded in obtaining the attachment or an order preventing a conveyance of the thing during the pendency of the action. the right of the creditor has not been modified by the judicial mortgage, nor has its character been changed. The creditor has simply obtained greater security by taking from the debtor the means of destroying the thing, of conveying it away, or of going into insolvency. Therefore, in the case of the insolvency of a nonmerchant or the bankruptcy of a merchant, those who have obtained in their favor judicial mortgages of the class above referred to did not obtain, nor will they now obtain thereby, any preferred claim over and above other creditors of the same class, nor can they be classed as mortgage creditors. <br/><br/>\"These principles having been adopted by the proposed bill, they give a new lease of life to our ancient law and again proclaim that the creditor who obtains in his favor a provisional record, the object of which is to secure the consequences of a favorable judgment, shall solely enjoy preference over other creditors who hold claims against the same debtor which have accrued subsequent to the provisional record. Nor could it be otherwise without violating the principles of justice. One who makes a contract and does not demand a mortgage security contents himself with the security given him by the personal credit of the debtor, and should not be given any preference over others who find themselves in the same circumstances. If the debtor fails to perform his agreement at the time fixed the creditor may compel him to make payment by bringing his action, but this action does not change either the nature of the credit or the force of the claim. If any other rule were to be established the result would be that as to several creditors of the same class of one debtor the advantage would be on the part of the most insistent, the most relentless, the one who by fair means or foul might obtain exact information as to the condition of the estate of the debtor, the one who had the most diligent attorney. The Commission, following the teachings of the old law, has considered that none of these causes should be ground for preference.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The Commission says elsewhere:  \"It can not be said with justice that by a judicial order, which has merely a provisional character, the nature of the obligation is changed, or that it is thereby converted from a simple to a mortgage debt; nor that it places at a disadvantage creditors of the same character; nor that it destroys the right of preference of mortgage creditors as established by the laws.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Moscoso says:  \"We have stated repeatedly that the provisional record does not change the character of the obligation or the right which is its object; its effects are prospective; it solely affects persons who come later, who, with respect to the property embraced by the record, can not disregard the liability to which such property appears to be subject. This is because from the time of the provisional record this liability is made public by its entry in the register.\" (Legislacion Hipotecaria, p. 343.) <br/><br/>The Supreme Court has repeatedly announced the same doctrine. In the judgment of the 26th of October, 1888, it is said:  \"That the record of attachments of real estate made for the purpose of securing the result of a suit does not alter the nature of the demand in litigation has repeatedly been held by this court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The Civil Code, in article 1923, No. 4, in respect to preferences over described real estate, says:  \"Claims recorded in the register of property by virtue of a judicial order, by attachment, sequestration, or execution of judgments over the goods covered by the record, and only in respect to subsequent claims.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This is, in substance, the language of article 44 of the Mortgage Law. The words  \"subsequent claims\" in the first have the same meaning as the words  \"contracted after said record\" in the Mortgage Law. <br/><br/>According to the express terms of this article, the record affects only subsequent claims. It does not affect a prior one. The relation between the claim in favor of which the record is made and any other claim of a prior date is not changed in any way by the record. If the claim of the appellee was prior to that of the appellants without the record of this attachment, it was so after it. The express terms of the article, and the nature itself of a record of this class, as we have seen, permit no other conclusion. <br/><br/>In view of the condition in which the respective claims of the parties were found at the time the complaint in intervention was filed this article (1923) is not applicable. Neither is article 1927. We are not required to consider at present the apparent contradictions noticed by Moscoso (p. 344) between this article, No. 2, and article 1923, No. 4. <br/><br/>The plaintiff, Doña Gregoria Martinez, having a claim entitled to preference over that of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. in respect to the amount of 149 pesos, her right to maintain this complaint so far as that sum is concerned has been settled by the decision of the supreme court of Spain in the judgment of October 6, 1886. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and it is declared that said Doña Gregoria is entitled to a preference only in respect to 149 pesos and 56 5/8 cents.

The first has an area of 7,978 hectares 75 ares and 99 centares. A part of it was devoted to the cultivation of palay, a part to cultivation of sugar cane, a part to building lots, and more than 3,000 hectares uncultivated. The area of the hacienda of Santa Cruz is not stated, but it appears from the petition that it was applied to the same uses as the hacienda of Naic, and that the petitioner had on it a stock farm which occupied part of the same. <br/><br/>The prayer of the petition is that:  \"The company be given judicial possession of the estates above described in the form prescribed by law, the act to be effected in the towns of Santa Cruz and Naic, and that the persons commissioned to that effect publish in said towns by placards the possession of the respective estates, in order that the tenants may be informed thereof, and that, more especially in the town of Naic, demand be made upon the military officers who occupy the principal building thereon and the warehouse, and to the occupant of the hydraulic mill, to recognize the said company as the possessor of the said properties. In the petition it was not asked that any such demand be made upon any other tenant or occupant of the said estate. <br/><br/>On the 27th of June the court of Cavite made an order of granting the prayer of the petitioner and directing that orders be issued to the justices of the peace of Naic land Santa Cruz in compliance with the provisions of articles 2017 and 2018 of the said Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>On the 17th of July the said justice of the peace of Santa Cruz notified the court that on the 15th of said month he had received the order addressed to him, and that before giving possession there appeared before him the local president and the military commander of the detachment stationed in that pueblo, and some of the inhabitants of the vicinity, in number 200, more or less, who protested that they would not recognize  \"as a representative of said company the said Don Francisco, and they also protested against the date of the order.\" In view of this appearance and statement, the justice of the peace stated that he had suspended further proceedings, and he asked instructions of the court. <br/><br/>By an order of the 17th of July, 1901, the court directed the justice of the peace that he should enter upon his record the protest which had been made by the parties prejudiced by the proceedings, who would have a right to make formal opposition before the court for the purpose of preserving their rights. <br/><br/>On the 20th of July, 1901, Don Eduardo Imzon y Ison, a resident of Santa Cruz, in the name of the people of that pueblo, presented to the Court of First Instance an objection to the granting of the prayer of the petitioner. <br/><br/>On the 20th of July, 1901, said court, by telegraph, ordered the justice of the peace to suspend the proceedings mentioned in the first order. It does not appear in the record that anything more was done in Santa Cruz looking to the fulfillment of the order of the court issued on the 27th of June. <br/><br/>On the 13th of August, 1901, the petitioner presented a motion asking the revocation of the above-mentioned order of suspension. On the 16th of the same month this motion was served upon the provincial fiscal, who, on the 28th of the same month, presented his opinion, saying that the objection made by the municipality ought to be sustained. <br/><br/>The order issued on the 27th of June directed to the Justice of the peace of Naic was not received by the latter until the 21st of August, 1901. Upon receiving it the justice of the peace demanded, in writing, of the military commander who was in possession of the dwelling house on the estate, and of the local president of the municipality who had in his possession the hydraulic machinery, that they should recognize the petitioner as the owner of said property. It does not appear that any answer was given to this document by the military officer who was in possession of the dwelling house upon the estate. The local president, however, following the instructions of the municipal council, refused, on the 30th of August, to deliver the possession of the machinery, or to recognize the petitioner as the owner of it. It appears that notices were published in Naic as a preliminary, according to the justice of the peace, to the act of giving possession. In consequence of this publication there was presented to the justice of the peace on the 24th of August, 1901, a protest, signed by more than 200 residents of the pueblo, who stated in their protest that they were occupying a part of the land described in the petition; that they were opposed to the possession which the petitioner claimed, and they asked that, the proceedings should be suspended, and that the company should be required to maintain their rights in an ordinary action. <br/><br/>On August 26 there was presented to the Court of First Instance of Cavite a formal protest, identical with that which had been presented before the justice of the peace. <br/><br/>In view of the presentation of this protest to the Court of First Instance the latter, on August 2S, ordered the provisional suspension of the proceedings mentioned in the order of the 27th of June, and directed the justice of the peace that he should report if all the lands of the estate were included in the opposition. This order of suspension did not reach the justice of the peace until after the 30th day of August, and upon that date he proceeded to give possession in the following form:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The justice’s court, convened in the public plaza of this town for the purpose of giving possession, as directed by the preceding order, after publication and formal notice, and there being present Don Peregrin Mestre, representing Don Francisco Gutierrez y Repide and Don Antonio Denhardt, the court gave possession to the former, reading the said order in an audible voice, and describing the lands of which possession is thus given with all solemnity, inviting the said Señor Peregrin Mestre to freely enter upon and depart from the lands which are the property of the company.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The justice of the peace also says that in said act some of the inhabitants of the pueblo opposed the proceedings, and twenty-eight of them presented a written statement in which their protest appears. <br/><br/>It appears in the record that Francisco Gutierrez had been named as attorney for the petitioner in place of Don Baldomero de Hazañas, for the purpose of receiving, said possession. <br/><br/>The petition is accompanied by a copy of a public document which apparently shows a right of property in the petitioner over the land described in the petition. <br/><br/>On the 6th of September, 1901, Don Baldomero de Hazañas presented a written answer to the opinion of the fiscal of August 28 above cited. In it he asked that the court grant the prayer contained in his first motion of August 13. <br/><br/>On the 12th of September, 1901, the court of Cavite entered the judgment declaring the matter contention. On September 2a the petitioner appealed from this order, and his appeal was admitted on September 26. In the hearing before this court it was stated that in respect to the hacienda of Naic possession had been given before any protest was presented. This statement is not borne out by the record. The only possession which was attempted to be given was that made by the justice of the peace on the 30th of August; which was not only subsequent to the presentation to the Court of First Instance of the written objection, but also after that court had ordered the justice of the peace to suspend the proceedings. <br/><br/>Two questions are raised by the record: (1) Is article 1800 of the Law of Civil Procedure applicable to proceedings commenced under said Title XIII in such a way that when objection is made it is necessary to declare the matter contentions? (2) If objection could be made, was it properly done in this case?<br/><br/>1. Possession includes the idea of occupation, and except in the cases mentioned in article 144, the possession can not exist without it. (Art. 430 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>It is true that it is not necessary that the proprietor himself should be the occupant. This occupancy can be held by another in his name. (Art. 431.) But it is necessary that there should be such occupancy or there is no possession. <br/><br/>The owner of real estate has the civil possession, either when he himself is physically in occupation of the property, or when another person who recognizes his rights as owner is in such occupancy. Let us suppose that the owner sells a tract of real estate. The purchaser, by virtue of that sale, does not immediately acquire the possession. The only direct transmission of possession is that which is brought about by operation of law upon the death of the opponent. (Art. 440). The purchaser can acquire the possession by the acts and legal formalities established for the purpose of acquiring such right. (Art. 438). One of these formalities is that which is prescribed by Title XIII, book 3, of the Law of Civil Procedure in question. The possession which is mentioned in said title is the same possession mentioned in the Civil Code; that is, the possession which includes occupation. The object of the proceeding is to confer upon the petitioner that occupation. This can be done in two ways. If the real estate is vacant, the purchaser can without difficulty be placed in possession of it. The judicial proceeding clothes the act with more solemnity and the proof of the same is better preserved than if the purchaser should take possession by himself. If the real estate is found in the actual possession of a third person, and that third person, upon being so requested by the officer of the court, recognizes the purchaser as the owner, the latter acquires the complete civil possession, because, although he himself does not actually occupy the real estate, there is another person who does so in his name. But in no case can possession be acquired by means of this proceeding when there exists a third person who is in occupation of the property and who is opposed to it.  \"Every occupant has the right to be respected in his possession.\" (Art. 446 of the Civil Code.)  \"He who believes that he has a right to deprive another of the possession of a thing must seek the aid of the proper authority if the occupant objects to the delivery.\" (Art. 441.) <br/><br/>From the very nature, then, of the case, it appears that proceedings of voluntary jurisdiction must necessarily terminate if the person who is in possession refuses to abandon the real estate or to recognize the petitioner as owner. Let us suppose that there is an estate in the active occupation of A. The petitioner obtains from the judge an order that he be placed in the possession of this estate possessed by A. The bailiff, assisted by the clerk appears upon the property and requires A to abandon it, in order that they may place the plaintiff in possession of it. A refuses to do so. They then demand of him that he recognize the petitioner as the owner of the estate. He refuses to do this. The bailiff has no right to evict him by force. He can do no more than return to the court and inform the judge that he could not give the petitioner possession. With this action, the proceeding also terminates. It would make no difference what titles or rights A was able to present, or if he had no right at all. It would be sufficient that he was in the actual occupation of the estate, and that he refused to abandon it or recognize the petitioner as owner. It can not be correctly said that, in such a case, the competent authority whose aid the petitioner has to invoke in accordance with article 441, above cited, is the court which has taken cognizance of these proceedings of voluntary jurisdiction. Article 446 would be entirely disregarded if, by means of a judicial procedure of this character, in which he was not a party and in which he held no opportunity to be heard, the actual occupant could be evicted from the estate. The bale possessor, if he is disturbed in his possession, has the right to commence against the person who is interfering with his possession the action to  \"retain\" or to  \"recover,\" according to the circumstances, both by article 446 of the Civil Code and by article 1646 of the Law of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>Title XIII can not authorize the dispossession of the occupant when this very act of eviction would confer upon the occupant the right to commence an action to be restored to the possession. The competent authority, mentioned in said article 441, is the court which would have jurisdiction in a suit between parties. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the appellant that the law does not: authorize any opposition in this suit of voluntary jurisdiction, because the act ordered to be done by the judge constitutes only a modification. The language of the law does not support this claim. The law does not say that the bailiff shall notify the tenants of the change of ownership. What it does say is that he shall give the petitioner the possession and require the tenants to recognize as such the new owner. If by reason of the opposition the possession can not be given, the suit of voluntary jurisdiction produces no effect. . Its whole effect rests upon the consent given by the person when his consent is demanded. If that consent is refused, nothing can be done in the suit of voluntary jurisdiction, since he can not be deprived of his rights without being heard in court. <br/><br/>The phrase  \"without prejudice to third persons\" must be interpreted in the sense that, if the proceedings in the suit of voluntary jurisdiction are made effective by the consent of the tenant, they do not prejudice persons other than the petitioner and the tenant. By this proceeding the possession is either conferred upon the petitioner or is not conferred. If it is not conferred, the proceeding produces no effect. If the possession is given, by that very act the person who was in possession is evicted, and therefore is necessarily prejudiced by the act. It is impossible to give the possession to the petitioner without taking it from him who was in possession, to the prejudice of the latter. The phrase, then,  \"without prejudice to third persons who have a better right,\" in article 2016, must refer to third persons other than the occupant. <br/><br/>Under the provisions of the Civil Code the objection of the occupant puts an end to the voluntary suit. If there is any provision in Title XIII which is opposed to this right it must be considered as repealed by the provisions of the Civil Code; but there is no such provision. Article 1800 says that, if opposition is made by anyone who has an interest in the matter, the suit will be made contentious. Under article 446 it is evident that the mere occupant has an interest in the matter, and that, in accordance with article 441, his opposition is sufficient to put an end to the suit of voluntary jurisdiction, and, under article 1800 of the Law of Civil Procedure, sufficient to justify the action of the court in making the suit contentious. <br/><br/>The supreme court of Spain has decided that article 1800 is applicable to Title XIII. (Judgment of March 24 1896.) Manresa is of the same opinion. (Commentaries on the Law of Civil Procedure, vol. 6, pp. 117, 481, 482\", 483.) <br/><br/>We therefore hold that if, either before or in the act of giving possession in accordance with Title XIII, the bare possessor objects to the proceeding, it must be made contentious. It is not necessary that this opposition should be made in any particular form. It is sufficient, for the purposes of article 441, that the occupant is opposed to the delivery. <br/><br/>2. Was the opposition which was made in this case sufficient? We think that it was. If the petitioner had asked that each one of the persons recognize him as owner, as we believe he ought to have done, the tenants would then have had an opportunity of refusing such consent and of refusing to deliver possession of the land. That, as we have seen, would have been sufficient. This, in fact, took place with respect to the pueblo of Naic as the possessor of the hydraulic machinery. <br/><br/>The other tenants, to whom no such opportunity was given, did all that they were able to do. A great number of them — the record says the pueblo in a mass — made their opposition known to the justice of the peace. More than two hundred of them presented in the Court of First Instance their protest in writing. <br/><br/>It has not been claimed that those persons who made opposition, and who appeared before the court and presented their formal objections, were not real occupants of the land. As such occupants they had, as we have seen all interest in the matter, and the right to make their opposition, in accordance with article 1800. We decide that the opposition made was sufficient, without considering that made by the municipality of Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>When the protest of two hundred and more tenants was presented to the Court of First Instance on the 28th of August, that court ordered a suspension of the proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining if the opposition included all the lands. <br/><br/>On the 3d of September the petitioner was notified of this order. The order which made the matter contentious was not entered until the 12th of September. We think that it was not the duty of the defendants, nor of the court, to ascertain if the opposition extended to all the lands. A sufficient opposition had been made with respect to part of them. If the petitioner did not wish that the whole suit be made contentious, he should have asked for an amendment of his petition, omitting those lands to which the opposition related. Not having done this, the fact that the entire matter was made contentious must be attributed to him. And in this court it has not been claimed that the judgment of the lower court was wrong because the whole matter was declared contentious, when this declaration ought to have been made only in respect to a part of it. <br/><br/>The order appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the <em>Appellant</em>.

The defendant was convicted in that court of the offense of lesiones graves, under No. 3 of article 416 of the Penal Code, and sentenced to three years of prision correccional. <br/><br/>The evidence shows that the complainant, Bernabela Pacleb, had forbidden the defendant, who appears to have been a suitor of her daughter, to come to her house; that on the occasion in question the defendant did go to the house, but whether for the purpose of paying his addresses to the daughter or of assaulting his prospective mother-in-law is not quite clear; that at all events some difficulty ensued between the two, and that the complainant ran out of the house into the street, followed by the defendant, who, after the two were in the street, struck her several times with a stick. The complainant then took refuge in the house of a neighbor, still pursued by the defendant, who, at the door of the house, continued for some time to noisily manifest his intention to  \"kill the old woman.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>As a result of the defendant’s blows the complainant was wounded over the left eye, and one of the bones of her left forearm was broken. The fracture, however, united in such a way as to leave no deformity other than a diminution of the movements of supination, not sufficient to prevent her from performing the light work to which she has been accustomed. She recovered from the injuries in forty days. She was incapacitated for doing any kind of work for twenty-eight days. <br/><br/>Upon these facts we think the defendant should have been convicted under article 416, No. 4 instead of No. 3 of the same article. In view of the sex of the complainant and that of the defendant, and of the other circumstances of the case, we think the court below was correct in finding the existence of the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 9. The evidence does not, in our judgment, warrant the conclusion reached by the court below that the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 20, is also present. We find no extenuating circumstances. <br/><br/>The judgment below should be reversed, and the defendant sentenced to two years of prision correccional and costs, without indemnification to the complainant, she having waived her right thereto.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Alejandro Bello, Bernabe Santos, Hipolito Hilario, Andres Estrella, and Anacleto Abena were tried upon a complaint for robbery in the Court of First Instance of Manila. Estrella and Abena were acquitted. The other three were convicted and appealed. Pending the appeal, this court was officially informed that Bellow and Santos had escaped from prison, and the cause was in consequence suspended as to them, but was heard and submitted as to the remaining defendant Hilario. <br/><br/>In the court below Bello was tried separately, and Hilario, Santos, Estrella, and Abena were tried together. <br/><br/>The evidence upon the trial of the four latter defendants shows conclusively that Hilario was one of a band of robbers, six in number, who early in the morning of the 11th of July, 1901, succeeded in effecting an entrance into the house of one Telesforo Obispo, in Tondo, under the pretext that they were policemen, where, after having beaten Obispo and thrown him on the floor and tied his wife and some of the other inmates of the house, they took possession of a sewing machine, some clothing, and various other articles which they found in the house, and a small sum of money, all of which they carried away. It appears from the evidence that Hilario carried a light and that two of the other robbers were armed, one with a gun and the other with a revolver and a bolo. <br/><br/>Hilario and Santos were convicted under the last clause of article 508 of the Penal Code. We think, confining ourselves, of course, at this time to the case of Hilario, that the conviction should have been under article 503, No. 5, there having been a certain amount of personal violence employed in effecting the robbery. We think, also, that the two aggravating circumstances of article 10, No. 8 and 15, are present. The defendant Hilario is therefore sentenced to ten years of presidio mayor, restitution of the property stolen, and costs.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The complaint upon which this case was instituted charges the crime of estafa, and is drawn in the following language:  \"Mateo Perez, in April, 1901, in Manila, appropriated the sum of 2,247 pesos, received in the course of the administration, to the prejudice of Maria Concepcion Ludia Sebastiana, . . . owner of the said money.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The accused demurred to the complaint under section 4 of article 21 of General Orders, No. 58, upon the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense. In support of his contention he alleged various facts tending to demonstrate that the sum of 2,247 pesos mentioned in the complaint had been embezzled by the Chinaman Calixto Santos, by means of the negotiation of a check which the defendant accepted as good in exchange for that amount of money, which check subsequently turned out to be a forgery, and that on this account the said Chinaman has been criminally prosecuted on relation of the defendant for the crime of estafa with falsification; that the loss of the said sum which thus occurred constitutes a loss chargeable to the business of the Hotel de España, which the defendant was at that time managing, and which should properly be borne by the complaining witness as owner of the hotel business; that this view being taken by the complainant herself, whom he had informed of what had occurred, she approved the accounts of his management presented to her in November, 1900; that thenceforth their relations and accounts were terminated, to the complete satisfaction of both, as shown by the fact that the complainant in that month took charge of the management of the hotel, and that she sold the hotel to the accused himself in January, 1901, and gave him a complete acquittance for the purchase money, without reservation or protest of any kind; that it was consequently false that he had appropriated the sum above mentioned as stated in the complaint. For the purpose of proving these allegations the accused presented various documents, which we do not consider it necessary to examine at this time. <br/><br/>Upon the facts alleged and the documents presented by the accused, the court below, by order of July 12, 1901, sustained the demurrer, declaring that the facts charged did not constitute a crime. Against this order the complaining witness appealed. <br/><br/>The counsel for the Government before this court asks that the order appealed be reversed, upon the ground that the facts charged do constitute the crime defined in paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>We concur in this opinion of counsel for the Government. The article cited punishes as guilty of estafa those who appropriate or misapply money, goods, or any other personal property received on deposit or on commission or administration, or by any other title which produces the obligation of delivering or returning the same. It is sufficient to read the complaint to reach the conclusion that upon its face the act charged is literally included within this provision of law. If the accused really received the money in question in the course of administration, and appropriated it, to the damage of the complainant — which is precisely the fact charged — it is evident that none of the elements constituting the crime of estafa charged in the complaint is missing; and it is therefore evident also that the facts charged as they appear from the complaint constitute a crime under the law. <br/><br/>We are unable to see how the contrary proposition could be maintained. The accused has not shown it, nor has he even endeavored to show it. What he did was to allege new facts not only different but diametrically opposed to those alleged in the complaint, thereby essentially altering the terms of the question. His allegations tend to show that he did not appropriate the money which the complainant alleges and insists that he did appropriate. It is evident that if this appropriation did not really take place the crime charged does not exist. But that is not the question. At this stage of the case there can be no discussion or demonstration as to the truth or falsity of the appropriation, as this will be the purpose of the evidence taken at the trial. The only question is whether this appropriation, taking it for granted as charged in the complaint, does or does not constitute a crime. <br/><br/>The demurrer of the defendant merely raises a question of law with respect to the criminal character of the facts charged. For the purpose of showing that the demurrer should be sustained the accused should limit himself to these facts, admitting them as the basis of the discussion just as they appear from the complaint or information, and should demonstrate that even though these facts be true, nevertheless they would not be punishable under the law. Every allegation which tends to deny them or modify them is and must of necessity be irrelevant, because it tends to raise a question of fact, which is not admissible under the peculiar nature of the exception. Consequently, such allegations can not be considered in passing upon the demurrer. We are therefore of the opinion that the order appealed does not conform to the law, because it is based upon facts which not only do not appear from the complaint but which completely alter and destroy its terms. <br/><br/>Counsel for the defendant has expressly prayed in this instance that we declare that the appeal of the complaining witness was improperly allowed, upon the ground that section 23 of General Orders, No. 58, provides that an order sustaining a demurrer by the accused ends the case, and is a bar to another prosecution for the same offense, and that section 44 grants the United States only the right to appeal against such an order. We consider this contention to be wholly unfounded. Section 23 does not deal with appeals, which are specially dealt with in other sections of the general order which determine in what cases an appeal may be allowed. It is unquestionable that the order in question is not unappealable, as the accused appears to contend, because section 44 cited says expressly that it may be appealed against by the United States. With respect to the private individual injured by the offense, as is the complainant in this case, the right to appeal from such an order is recognized in section 107, which, after providing that  \"the privileges now secured by law to the person claiming to be injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution . . . shall not be held to be abridged by the provisions of this order,\" expressly declares that such person, that is, the party injured, may appeal against any decision denying him a legal right. It is unnecessary to add that an order sustaining a demurrer by the accused is such an order, because it tends to make unavailing the rights which the injured party attempts to exercise by means of the complaint. It is evident that it has this effect, because such an order, when final, constitutes a bar to a continuation of the case or a subsequent prosecution for the same offense charged in the complaint. This order, therefore, being appealable, not only by the United States but also by the party injured, it is evident that the effects of the order must be subordinated to the result of the appeal taken by the latter, and the allowance of the appeal by the court below was perfectly legal and strictly in accordance with the statute. <br/><br/>The allegation of the accused that the order appealed produces jeopardy under the provisions of sections 26 and 28 of General Orders, No. 58, is no less unfounded. The first of these articles is applicable solely to cases in which the accused has been convicted or acquitted, which can not take place except when a prosecution has been carried through all its stages and a final judgment of conviction or acquittal rendered therein. Section 28 refers to orders if dismissal entered before final judgment, but after the accused has pleaded to a good complaint or information upon which a conviction might be sustained. In this case the accused not only has been neither convicted nor acquitted, but he has not even pleaded to the charge, precisely because he has put in issue, by means of his demurrer, the sufficiency of the complaint as a basis for a criminal proceeding. Furthermore, this being an appealable order against which an appeal has been taken, it is wholly improper to invoke such an order for the purpose of claiming the benefit of jeopardy thereunder, because such an order can not be regarded as final and executory, nor as producing any effect whatsoever until affirmed by the superior tribunal. At all events, the plea of jeopardy should be made before a judge of competent jurisdiction to try a case against the accused, and not before this court, whose jurisdiction in the present case is limited by law to passing upon the appeal taken by the complaining witness. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the demurrer filed by the accused should have been overruled. The order below is consequently reversed, with the costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The defendant, Leon Ballesteros, was prosecuted for nine crimes of estafa, and by the judgment of April 9, 1898, was convicted of eight crimes of consummated estafa and one crime of frustrated estafa. For each of the consummated crimes he was condemned to two months and one day of arresto mayor, and for the frustrated crime to pay a fine of 150 pesetas, with the accessories, and to the return of the money obtained by the estafa to each one of the persons injured, and in case of failure to pay the indemnification and the fine to suffer subsidiary imprisonment within the period allowed by law. The department of public prosecution asked that the judgment be affirmed, but that the duration of the penalties imposed upon the defendant for the eight crimes of estafa should not exceed the triple duration of one of the penalties, under the provisions of rule 2 of article 88 of the Penal Code. It is necessary for us, therefore, to pass upon the question raised by counsel for the Government under the provisions of section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, and the general penal law. <br/><br/>Under the provisions of rule 2 of article 88 of the Penal Code above cited the judgments consulted should be affirmed, but the maximum penalty to be suffered by the defendant for the eight consummated crimes of estafa must not exceed three times the duration of one of them, to wit, six months and three days of arresto mayor. The fine must be 325 pesetas, the minimum of this punishment as a correctional penalty, but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency or in case of failure to pay the indemnity to the persons injured, inasmuch as the amounts obtained by the estafa did not exceed 12ï¿½ pesetas from each.

Co-Guia,  \"as agent of the Chinaman Co-Quingco and manager of his lumber yard,\" says that  \"the rent corresponding to the months of February and March not having been received from him at the rate of 50 pesos per month, according to the contract,\" he made formal tender to Co-Tiongco of payment of the rental, to which Co-Tiongco replied  \"he can not receive the sum mentioned, offered him by the Chinese manager, Co-Guia, inasmuch as he has no contract with the said Chinaman, nor with Co-Quingco, the owner of the lumber yard\" (documentary evidence, pp. 24 to 29); (3) that on March 22 of the same year Co-Tiongco gave Co-Guia notice to vacate the premisses, giving him to the end of the month in which to do this. <br/><br/>With these facts as antecedents, the action of unlawful detainer was instituted. The action was based solely upon the contention that Co-Guia was occupying the lot as lessee, as stated by him in the minutes of the consignment of rent; that the lease was from month to month, as Co-Guia had stated in the same document that the rental was 50 pesos per month, and consequently that the lease expired at the end of each month. In bringing this action Co-Tiongco, the plaintiff, introduced as evidence the notice of the first consignment of rental offered to Eugenio Guidote, in whose possession this document must have been. <br/><br/>The defendant opposed the complaint, and in his answer vigorously denied the fundamental fact alleged therein. As evidence he introduced the contract of lease entered into between Co-Quingco of the one part and Sy-Quia and Guidote of the other part. <br/><br/>The question presented on appeal to this court is whether or not the action of unlawful detainer can be maintained by Co-Tiongco against Co-Guia upon the facts on which the action is founded. <br/><br/>The purchaser, as successor to the vendor by singular title for a valuable consideration, is not, as a general rule, bound to respect obligations of a personal character contracted by his predecessor, as is an heir who succeeds by universal gratuitous title with respect to the obligations of his decedent. Hence it is that the Civil Code in article 1571 provides, as a consequence of the rule stated, that the purchaser of the leased property is entitled to terminate a lease pending at the time of the sale. But when the rights in question are not those arising from merely personal obligations, but from an express agreement or a real right affecting the property itself which is transferred by the sale, in this case the rule does not apply. The same article 1571 denies the purchaser the right to end a pending lease in case there has been a stipulation to the contrary or if it has been forbidden by the provisions of the Mortgage Law. <br/><br/>The Mortgage Law provides that leases for more than six years’ duration should be recorded in the register of property. (Art. 2, par. 5.) The Mortgage Law provides further that recorded acts and contracts shall be enforceable against third persons. (Art. 23.) Recordation is a species of promulgation of the private law of the act or contract producing it, a requisite as indispensable to this law to give it obligatory force as is promulgation with respect to laws emanating from the public authorities. (Moscoso, Mortgage Law.) The lease of the lot in question agreed upon between Sy-Quia and Guidote on the one hand and Co-Quingco on the other hand having been recorded, it is obligatory law for third persons, such as is, in this case, Co-Tiongco. He being bound to respect this lease for the period of ten years, he can not pretend ignorance of the right of use which was and still is in the hands of a third person. The vendor Guidote could not transmit to him any greater right than that which he himself had at the time of the sale. At this time among his rights of dominion which he transmitted to Co-Tiongco the right of use was not really — although virtually — included, as this right had been alienated in March, 1894, in consideration of the sum of 50 pesos per month, up to an equal date in the year 1904. He could only transmit to the purchaser the right to end the lease before the expiration of the term and to reacquire the use of the lot before the date stipulated by showing some resolutory cause against the present possessor of the right of use, Co-Quingco, and obtaining a final judgment resulting in the cancellation of the inscription appearing in the property register; or, in other words, the derogation of that private law which, until such time, must bind him. Until Co-Quingco, the possessor of the right of use, has had his day in court and judgment has been rendered against him, the allegation of a resolutory cause tending to produce the rescission of a bilateral contract entered into with Co-Quingco can not be effective when the allegation is made and the judgment is obtained against a stranger, such as, in this case, is Co-Guia. Co-Guia was not even a sublessee. He was, as admitted by Co-Tiongco himself, the manager of the lumber yard constructed on the lot of which Co-Quingco is the owner. So that the judgment rendered by the court below against Co-Guia can produce no effect whatever against Co-Quingco, the case not having been brought against Co-Guia as representative of Co-Quingco but against a trespasser, but a trespasser who pays rent and occupies the lot by virtue of the lease. <br/><br/>We therefore hold that the action of unlawful detainer brought will not lie, and dismiss the complaint against the defendant, Co-Guia, reversing the judgment below in all its parts, without special condemnation as to costs. <br/><br/>Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>It does not appear from the record, nor has it even been hinted, at what time and upon what conditions Co-Guia took the place of the now absent Co-Quingco in the lease of the lot. The defendant, who exhibited with his answer the instrument in which was recorded the contract of lease entered into between Pedro Sy-Quia and the said Co-Quingco, with the consent of the real owner of the lot, Eugenio C. Guidote, did nothing more than affirm that he is a mere agent (encargado) of Co-Quingco. He did not prove his capacity as such agent (encargado), or that he was in any other sense the attorney in fact or representative of the former tenant, absent in China, or why he has been paying the rental of the lot leased in the name of Co-Quingco. Co-Guia having been sued as tenant in his own right, he could not lawfully set up the contract of lease, by virtue of which Co-Quingco was tenant, because it does not appear that he has been subrogated to the rights of the latter under the terms of the contract with respect to the use and enjoyment of the lot, with the consent of the owner, Eugenio Guidote, and therefore he should be regarded as such tenant by virtue of a new verbal contract from month to month, inasmuch as the contrary does not appear to have been proven. <br/><br/>The lot having been redeemed from Pedro Sy-Quia and an absolute conveyance having been made by the former owner, Eugenio Guidote, to the Chinaman Francisco Saez Co-Tiongco, the latter has a perfect right to demand the termination of the lease pending in favor of Co-Guia, under the provisions of article 1571 of the Civil Code. It does not appear that any agreement to the contrary was made between the vendor, Guidotre, and the purchaser, Saez Co-Tiongco. The rights accruing under the former contract of lease and its recordation in favor of the contracting parties named in the contract of lease can not be set up by the defendant Co-Guia. He was not one of the contracting parties, nor does he in any wise appear in this contract. There being no evidence to the contrary, he should be regarded as a lessee under a new verbal contract from month to month, because the payment of rent was monthly, and consequently the lease can be treated as terminated without the necessity of notice at the expiration of each month, in accordance with the provisions of article 1581 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>The burden of proof that Co-Guia has been occupying the lot not as a tenant in his own right but as sublessee of Co-Quingco, or as encargado or agent of the latter, rests upon him, inasmuch as he so alleges in his reply, and not upon the plaintiff, inasmuch as it is an unquestionable fact that the plaintiff, Saez Co-Tiongco, is the owner of the lot. A person who occupies a lot in consideration of the payment of a monthly rental must be presumed to occupy it as a tenant until it be shown that his occupation is in some other capacity. Against the assertion of the plaintiff no evidence to the contrary appears in the record to support the allegation of the defendant who, if he paid rent in the name of the former tenant, could have shown receipts signed by the owner so stating. He did not exhibit these receipts because they would not support his allegation, but would show that Co-Guia is a true tenant under an entirely different contract. <br/><br/>The tenant is entitled to use and enjoy the thing leased as long as the contract of lease continues, but he has not the legal possession of the thing, because he possesses it in the name of the proprietor, the only one who has the real legal possession as owner, with the corresponding right to bring actions of all kinds, including the action of unlawful detainer in cases authorized by law. <br/><br/>The defendant, Co-Guia, who denies that he is a tenant under a verbal contract entered into with the former owner of the lot, has no right to rest his defense upon the former contract of lease recorded by public instrument and upon which the rights of the former tenant, Co-Quingco, rested, because he has not shown that he is the successor of Co-Quingco, or that he has been subrogated to his rights under the contract, or that he is an agent or attorney in fact of that tenant, and because Co-Guia was not one of the parties to the contract referred to and could acquire no right to the use of the lot by virtue thereof. <br/><br/>The legal effects of a contract of lease recorded in a public instrument and inscribed in the property register are of no avail with respect to the enjoyment of the lot leased to one who is not a contracting party, nor a representative or sublessee of one of the contracting parties. <br/><br/>The contract is law between the contracting parties, and its recordation in the register is its promulgation and guaranty, and from this point of view the rights and obligations arising therefrom can only favor or affect those who have agreed to them, their representatives, or their legal successors. Co-Guia is a stranger. He is not a sublessee or a lawful representative of the contracting tenant, Co-Quingco, and therefore can not set up the acts of the latter nor continue to hold the lot to the detriment of the rights of the present owner, Co-Tiongco. <br/><br/>The judgment in this case should solely affect those who took part therein as litigants. As Co-Quingco is not a party to this action it is unquestionable that it could not have affected him or prejudiced his rights. The favorable judgment which the plaintiff, Co-Tiongco, might have obtained would not have been rendered against Co-Quingco, who did not litigate and is not a party to this suit, but against the defendant, Co-Guia, who has no right as lessee to the possession of the property and should be evicted therefrom. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated it is irrelevant to discuss the efficacy of the contract of lease referred to, and much less the efficacy and consequences of its recordation in the register of property. These questions, if raised at the proper time by some person entitled to raise them in a suit, will be determined in accordance with law. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated, therefore, and accepting the conclusions of law laid down in the judgment appealed so far as the same agree with those expressed in this opinion, I believe that the judgment should be affirmed with the costs to the <em>Appellant</em>. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a motion to dismiss an appeal from an order removing a guardian. <br/><br/>The Code of Civil Procedure now in force points out two methods, radically different, for bringing cases to this court. One is by bill of exceptions and the other is by appeal. The first refers to ordinary suits, the second to special proceedings. Any ordinary action can be brought to the Supreme Court by a bill of exceptions. (Art. 143.) There does not, however, exist any general provision which authorizes an appeal in all kinds of special proceedings. Article 772 is limited to proceedings in the cases of adoption; articles 778, 779, and 780 to orders concerning the allowance of accounts of executors, administrators, and guardians; article 781 to orders declaring the validity or nullity of wills; article 782 to orders directing the partition of property; and article 783 to final orders in testate or intestate estates and the administration of guardians and trustees. <br/><br/>This case falls within the provisions of article 783. It was not in any sense an ordinary suit. Article 574, in connection with article 581, gives to the Court of First Instance the power to remove guardians. It is evident that the order in this case was entered by the court by virtue of its jurisdiction in special proceedings concerning the administration of guardians. Being an order entered in special proceedings, it ought to have been brought here by an appeal and not by a bill of exceptions. In order to perfect an appeal in accordance with article 783 only two things are required of the appellant — he must present a written notice of appeal and he must give a bond. In respect to the first requirement, it was stated at the argument of this case, and not denied by the opposing party, that the appellant presented to the court a notice of appeal and that he was told by the judge that in that case an appeal was not proper, and ten days were given him for the presentation of a bill of exceptions. In this bill of exceptions prepared by the appellant and signed by the judge it is said that the appellant, upon being notified of the order, appealed; and there also appears in the record an order admitting the appeal. We are satisfied that what the appellant did in this case amounted to a notice of appeal within the meaning of said article 781. <br/><br/>With regard to the second requisite — that is, the bond — it appears that the appellant in fact gave a bond in the sum of $3,000, which was approved by the judge. It also appears, however, that by an order of the court said bond was conditioned for the performance of the judgment by the appellant in case it was affirmed. The condition should have been that he would prosecute his appeal and pay the damages and costs occasioned by reason thereof. (Art. 780.) The question is, Ought we to dismiss the appeal by reason of this defect in the bond?<br/><br/>Article 500 says no bill of exceptions shall be dismissed for defects of form which do not affect the rights of the parties, nor for any defect which can be cured. It is true that this article only treats of bills of exceptions and not of appeals, but it is evident that it was the intention that it was to be applied to both. They are no more than different methods of accomplishing the same ends — that is, the removal of a suit from a lower to a higher court. If a bill of exceptions ought not to be dismissed for defects of form, an appeal ought not to be. We think that this article is applicable to both cases, and that the defect which appears in the bond is one which can be corrected. <br/><br/>When an appeal is perfected in special proceedings, in accordance with article 783, it is the duty of the clerk to send to this court a certified copy of the evidence introduced. At the hearing in this court it was stated that this had not been done. In such a case article 501 requires us to suspend the hearing until the record is complete. We are not allowed to dismiss an appeal for such reasons. <br/><br/>The attorney for the appellee stated at the hearing that the appellant had never served upon him his assignment of errors and brief, as required by the rules of this court. The attorney for the appellant answered that they were included in the bill of exceptions which had been served upon the appellee. This, of course, is not a proper place for them. The bill of exceptions should contain facts only. It is a statement of what occurred at the trial in the court below. Argument has no place in it. This should be made in the brief. This mistake of the appellant has not in any way, however, prejudiced the appellee, upon whom the brief and assignment of errors was served, although not in proper form. The appeal ought not to be dismissed by reason of this mistake. <br/><br/>For the reasons above mentioned, the motion to dismiss the appeal is denied, but it is ordered that the appellant be required, within twenty days from this date, to file in the court below a bond approved by that court in such sum as that court may order, conditioned as provided in article 780. If he should fail to do so the appeal will be dismissed. It is further ordered that the clerk of said court send forthwith to this court, at the expense of the appellant, certified copies of all the evidence presented at the trial there held, with the exception of those parts of the same which have already been remitted; that upon the receipt of the same the clerk of this court order them to be printed at the expense of the appellant and distributed to the parties; that the brief and assignment of errors in the so-called bill of exceptions be considered as the brief and assignment of errors of the appellant, and that the appellee be given twenty days from the receipt of the said printed additions to the record for the service of his brief upon the opposite party and the filing in this court. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>As stated in the opinion of the majority of the court, the Code of Civil Procedure (1901) provides two radically different methods for removing a case to this court. One is by means of a bill of exceptions; the other is by means of an appeal. The former relates to ordinary actions, the latter relates to special proceedings. As further stated by the court the order appealed from was made in a special proceeding and should have been brought here by appeal and not by a bill of exceptions. For this reason a motion has been made by appellee to dismiss the case, which has been overruled by the court. From this decision I dissent. <br/><br/>The provisions relating to the bringing of cases here by bill of exceptions have been strictly followed. There can be no doubt in this respect as to the intention of the <em>Appellant</em>. No attempt whatever has been made to follow the provisions for appeal in special proceedings nor has there been any substantial compliance with them. This decision will in future be a precedent for the rule that, notwithstanding the radical differences in the mode of bringing cases to this court, as provided by statute, an ordinary bill of exceptions will be sufficient for that purpose in all cases of both special proceedings and ordinary suits. Whether the different modes provided by the Code are likely to cause confusion and whether there are sufficient reasons for making such difference are questions purely for the legislative discretion. The law should not be changed by judicial legislation or construed away by decision. <br/><br/>The methods of bringing an appeal in a special proceeding are (1) by filing with the Court of First Instance an application for an appeal within twenty days after the entry of the judgment (Art. 781), and (2) by giving a satisfactory bond to the court conditioned that the appellant will prosecute the appeal to effect and pay the intervening damages and costs occasioned by such appeal (Art. 780). That the bond was given in the case was not intended as an appeal bond appears on the face of the same. It is stated by the clerk in his certificate that the bond was given in the sum of $3,000 in accordance with article 144 of the Code. Article 144, referred to, is the provision of the statute for a supersedeas bond where a case has been brought to this court by a bill of exceptions. The condition of this bond is not, in substance, the same as that provided for in appeal bond. It is perfectly clear that the parties did not contemplate the execution of an appeal bond. <br/><br/>As to the other requisite, the filing with the Court of First Instance of an application for an appeal within twenty days after the judgment, there has been no attempt to comply with the statute. The statement that the appellant presented to the court below an application for an appeal and was told by the court that it was not a case in which an appeal would like, but that remedy was by bill of exceptions, not only shows that there was no attempt to comply with the provision requiring the filing of the application but shows clearly a change of purpose and an abandonment by the appellant of that mode to appeal the case. <br/><br/>The statement contained in the bill of exceptions prepared by the appellant and signed by the court, that the appellant appeals the case, clearly conveys the idea that the method of appeal was by a bill of exceptions. It was not a statement tending in the least to show that the appellant had or was attempting to bring the case up by the method of appeal for special proceedings. The supposed order contained in the bill of exceptions allowing the appeal is nothing more than a receipt of the bill of exceptions by the Court of First Instance, stating that by such bill of exceptions the appeal to the Supreme Court was admitted, and required a bond in accordance with section 144, which, as stated above, is a supersedeas bond, given only in cases of bills of exceptions, clearly showing that the appeal intended was by means of a bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>But no order is required to perfect the appeal in special proceedings, nor would any such order, if shown, have the effect of supplying the requisite prescribed by statute. <br/><br/>These provisions of law are simple and easily complied with. <br/><br/>The Civil Code of Procedure is new to the native lawyer and doubtless presents many perplexing questions. Its meaning may often be misconstrued, but in the desire to relieve them, if to these difficulties are superadded unnatural and forced constructions of its provisions, the difficulties are multiplied and the confusion will become hopeless. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was convicted of murder in the Court of First Instance of Manila and sentenced to death. The case is before this court on appeal and in consultation. <br/><br/>On the night of the 15th of August, 1900, the defendant and three other men, all armed with revolvers and daggers, broke into the house of Lorenzo Laopoco, in Tondo, tied Laopoco and his son-in-law, Norberto Anacleto, and after committing various acts of violence upon Anacleto’s wife and the other persons in the house, and taking some jewelry and money, left the house, carrying with them Laopoco. These facts were satisfactorily established by the evidence of Anacleto and his wife. There was no direct evidence as to what occurred after the robbers left the house, but immediately thereafter Anacleto and his wife heard Laopoco cry out for help, saying that the robbers were going to kill him, and upon opening the window and looking out they saw him lying on the ground and around him or in the act of leaving the spot the defendant and his companions, including several who had not entered the house. Laopoco was taken into the house, and was found to be covered with wounds inflicted with daggers, in consequence of which he died in about three weeks. <br/><br/>Upon these facts the defendant is clearly guilty either of homicide or, if the constitutive circumstance of alevosia is present, of murder. The prosecuting attorney is of the opinion that this circumstance has not been shown, and that the crime is therefore to be regarded as simple homicide, and asks that the judgment of the court below be modified in accordance with the view. <br/><br/>The ground upon which the prosecuting attorney bases this opinion is that  \"it has been impossible to show clearly the means, methods, and manner which the criminals availed themselves of for the purpose of perpetrating the crime. No one was present when the deceased was attacked by them, nor does it even appear from the record whether he was or was not bound when the wounds from which he died were inflicted upon him. These are data which must of necessity be proved in order to legally determine whether the circumstance of alevosia is present.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The facts showing alevosia as a generic or qualificative circumstance may, under the Spanish system of evidence in criminal cases, be established by the same kind and degree of proof as the main facts upon which the guilt of the accused is predicated. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of January 22, 1878, fifth conclusion of law; the provisional law for the application of the provisions of the Penal Code in the Philippine Islands, par. 52.) In neither case are  \"mere presumptions\" or  \"arbitrary deductions from hypothetical or presumable facts\" admissible. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of October 7, 1871.) In both cases, if the inference of guilt rests solely upon circumstantial evidence, such evidence must be  \"grave and conclusive,\" and  \"the conviction which the combination of such evidence produces must be such as to leave no room for reasonable doubt as to the criminality of the accused in the ordinary and natural order of things.\" (Provisional law above cited.) If there were anything in these rules inconsistent with the new law of criminal procedure fixing the degree of certainty with which the guilt of the accused — that is to say, every element constituting his guilt — is to be proved, and prescribing the nature of the evidence which must be employed for this purpose, the principles of the latter law would prevail. It is clear that under that law no discrimination is made between direct and circumstantial evidence in any case, and that the only requirement is that the guilt of the accused be proved by relevant evidence, the best of which the case is susceptible, and beyond a reasonable doubt. (General Orders, No. 58, secs. 57 and 59.) <br/><br/>It is true that in the present case there was no ocular evidence that the deceased was bound at the moment when the fatal wounds were inflicted. And it is also true that the two witnesses for the prosecution who saw him while he was lying on the ground after the stabbing have omitted to state whether he was at that time bound or not. But it has been proved that he was bound in the house, and while it is of course barely possible that his captors may have released him before putting him to death, the only reasonable conclusion,  \"according to the ordinary and natural order of things.\" is that he remained bound until their purpose was accomplished. It is not easy — indeed, it is almost impossible — to conceive any reason why he should have been liberated in the short interval that elapsed between the time he was taken from the house and the time he was killed. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the evidence is entirely sufficient to show that the crime was committed with alevosia as defined in article 10, No. 2, of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 15, is clearly present, the crime having been committed in a band. We are of opinion that no generic extenuating circumstances are present, and that, in view of the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the accused, the circumstance of article 11 can not properly be considered in his favor. <br/><br/>The result is that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed with costs. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, dissents. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On June 20, 1901, Pio Espiritu brought this action against Mariano Deseo to recover the possession of certain lands, together with damages, upon the ground that the plaintiff had been in the possession as lessee of the said lands, the property of the Augustinian Friars, from the year 1884 to the year 1898, at which time he was dispossessed by the defendant. The defendant made the following allegations in opposition to the complaint: (1) That the alleged lease upon which the plaintiff bases his complaint has not been proven by any competent evidence; (2) that the action which plaintiff might properly have brought for the recovery of possession is the restitutory interdict, but that the possessory action corresponds exclusively to the owner of the property; and (3) that the plaintiff has lost the right of possession by the expiration of more than one year. <br/><br/>The defendant further alleges that he has been in possession of the said lands and the lot in question for seventeen years, of the former by composition with the State and of the second by right of testamentary succession. <br/><br/>After a careful examination of the record we have not been able to find therein any evidence of the existence of any contract of lease of the lands in question executed by the Augustinian Friars in favor of the plaintiff, or any evidence from which might be deduced the existence of any right on the part of the plaintiff to the lands in question. The presentation of receipts which show the payment of the amount of the annual ground rent corresponding to several years prior to the act of dispossession by no means tends to demonstrate that the plaintiff on the date at which this action was brought had any subsisting contract of lease on said lands. <br/><br/>The plaintiff might have brought the summary action of restitutory interdict if he had brought suit within a year from the time of the execution of the act alleged to constitute the dispossession, and which took place in 1898, founding his claim exclusively upon the possession of the property then enjoyed by him. (Law of Civil Procedure, arts. 1634 and 1635.) The benefits of this former possession were lost by reason of the possession of the defendant for more than one year. <br/><br/>Not having the possession or ownership of the lands in question or any apparent right with respect to the same, the action can not be maintained. <br/><br/>It is not necessary to decide in this case whether the tenant can bring a possessory action, because the alleged lease has not been proven, nor is it necessary to determine the true character of the action brought by him. Neither is it necessary to decide whether he can maintain any action for the purpose of recovering the rents, issues, and profits or damages thereof, inasmuch as the record does not disclose their amount. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is therefore affirmed, with the costs to the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

It appears that the town of Pasay, with its streets, public squares, and buildings, is situated within this estate. The requirements of article 2020 of the Law of Civil Procedure were not strictly complied with in the original complaint, as no person interested was cited therein. The amended complaint only mentions the names of the adjacent property owners outside the perimeter of the estate. Although the municipality of Pasay was not cited, it entered an appearance in the action as the owner of streets, squares, and other lands.

Article 2020 of the Law of Civil Procedure grants the right to the owner as well as to  \"him who has a real right in the land for his use and benefit.\" For the purposes of this action the Codes are consistent with each other, and each one of them grants the owner this right. <br/><br/>If the person who solicits the remedy is not the actual owner he is not entitled to it. Passing for the present the question of real rights, it is evident that he who is not the owner of property is not entitled under either Code to survey and make a designation of the boundaries thereof. No one is entitled to the survey and designation of boundaries of an estate which is in the possession and is the property of another. Such a survey and designation of boundaries would imply an unlawful interference with the said possession and ownership. It could not be done without a material trespass upon the land, an act which no stranger has a right to perform. If a stranger should attempt to do so there is no doubt that the real owner would have an interest in the matter, under the provisions of article 1800 of the Law of Civil Procedure cited. Being a party in interest, he has a right to make opposition and to deny that the petitioner is the owner. Such opposition having been made, the judge can follow only one course. He sees that he is without authority in an action of voluntary jurisdiction to take cognizance of a contentious suit. He has no authority to decide that the petitioner is the owner and that the opposing party is not. He can not decide that the opposing party is the owner. He can only remit the parties to a contentious suit in which alone such questions can be decided. To direct a continuation of this act of voluntary jurisdiction, in view of the denial of ownership, would be practically equivalent to deciding the question in issue. This proceeding is available to the owner only. To allow the petitioner to utilize it is to decide that he is the owner, a fact which the opposing party denies. <br/><br/>But it is alleged that no one can make opposition, with the exception of the adjacent owners, and article 1807 is cited in connection with articles 1800 and 2029 of the Law of Civil Procedure. It has been repeatedly held by the supreme court of Spain and by the commentators that the proceeding under title 14 depends upon the consent of the parties and upon nothing else.  \"Upon the ground that there can be no suit if there is no contest or question between the parties, the law has placed the survey of property among the acts of voluntary jurisdiction, provided that it is effected with the consent or acquiescence, at least, of all the parties in interest. But from the moment in which one of them makes opposition, whether before the operation or at the time of its performance, it is carried into the domain of contentious jurisdiction. Until such opposition is made the act is inter volentes. Its validity depends upon the consent of the parties in interest, and if the judicial authorities are permitted to intervene it is not as an essential requisite, as there is no issue to be decided, but simply for the purpose of giving greater solemnity to the act, or for the purpose of avoiding obstacles which might arise either owing to the difficulty of getting together all the adjacent owners at the simple request of the one most interested, or by reason of the passive resistance of some of them. Thus it is that if they meet together voluntarily and by common agreement make the survey and record it in a notarial act or some other authentic document, it would have the same force and effect as if done with the intervention of the judicial authority.\" (6 Manresa’s Commentaries on Law of Civil Procedure, 486.) If the parties in interest do not consent to this proceeding, it must necessarily fail. This consent may be withheld by the owner, in which case the proceeding is entirely suspended. The consent may be refused by one of the adjacent owners, in which case the proceeding can not continue with respect to that part of the estate adjacent to his. An examination of titles 1 and 14 of book 3 of the Law of Civil Procedure demonstrates that these principles are therein recognized. Article 2020 says that the complaint shall state the names and residences of the persons who shall be cited to appear. Article 2021 says that the designation of the day and hour shall be made in such a manner that  \"all the parties in interest may be present, they to be previously cited in legal form.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 2029 is, in our opinion, entirely consistent with article 1800. The first article is specific; the second is general. Article 2029 limits the effects of the opposition made by an adjacent owner to that part in which he is interested, provided that the petitioner desires to continue with respect to the remainder. It was never intended to withhold from a third person who, under article 1800, has an  \"interest in the matter,\" as, for example, the owner or possessor, the right to oppose the proceedings. <br/><br/>That any other person not an adjacent property owner may have interest in this case is also evident when we pass to the second class of persons who may exercise this right; that is to say, those who have real rights. Such a person institutes proceedings; his intention is to obtain a survey and designation of boundaries of lands which are not his property but over which he has a real right. Argument is not necessary to show that the owner is interested in the survey of his own land; that he is a party interested in the case within the meaning of article 1800, and should be cited. Manresa, in his Commentaries on the Civil Code, states that the law is to this effect. (Vol. 3, p. 289.) If the owner is cited he is entitled to make opposition to the proceeding. If he makes opposition the proceeding must be declared contentious. He is a party in interest and he refuses his consent. Consent constitutes the basis of the act, and if this is lacking nothing can be done. <br/><br/>But are there any parties in interest other than adjacent owners and the owner of the property? Is a bare possessor who refuses to set forth the details of his claim a person interested, who can suspend the proceedings by refusing his consent? We have recently had occasion to consider the rights of such persons in the case of the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Limited, concerning judicial possession. According to the principles therein established, such a person must be respected in his possession, and in case of his being disturbed therein he is entitled to the remedy of interdicto de retener. We believe that the act of the petitioner who alleges that he is an owner and who makes an actual entry upon the land with the purpose of designating its boundaries constitutes such a disturbance as that spoken of in article 446 of the Civil Code as well as in article 1633 of the Law of Civil Procedure. Such an act is therefore contrary to law and can not be permitted under title 14. It follows that the naked possessor is a person in interest. Under the provisions of article 2021 he should be cited, and under article 1800 may make opposition. <br/><br/>It is not necessary to decide in this case whether the opposition made at the time by the inhabitants of the town was or was not sufficient. The petitioner alleges that he is with some exceptions the owner of all the lands included within the perimeter described, but in these exceptions he does not include the streets. The municipality of Pasay was the owner of said streets and public squares. (Arts. 339, 343, and 344 of the Civil Code.) These form part of the lands described in the petition and improperly claimed by the petitioner. As owner of part of the lands the municipality, as we have seen, was entitled to oppose the petition. The municipality undertook also to oppose the proceeding as the representative of the private interests of the inhabitants. It had no right to do this, but it expressly made opposition with respect to its ownership of the streets, squares, and other lands which did nor might belong to it. This last ground was sufficient, and the proceedings were properly terminated. <br/><br/>In conclusion we should add that whenever a dispute arises between parties interested in real property, either with respect to ownership or possession, they should not resort to this act of voluntary jurisdiction, nor insist upon it, no matter what may be the merits of the dispute. However unfounded may be the claims of either party, the fact that there is a dispute places the case beyond the scope of an act of voluntary jurisdiction. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. So ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>This is a voluntary proceeding for the survey and demarcation of the boundary lines of a tract of land containing about 400 hectares, called the  \"Hacienda de Pasay,\" instituted by Edwin H. Warner, who states in his application that he is the owner of the entire tract, with the exception of certain parts which are described by him, lying wholly within the perimeter and not touching the boundary lines of the part to be surveyed at any point. <br/><br/>After an order had been made by the court directing the survey and demarcation of the lines of the hacienda, and after they had in part surveyed and marked the land, the town of Pasay, acting through its municipal council, filed an opposition to the proceeding, upon which the court dismissed the same. From this order of dismissal the plaintiff has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>Voluntary proceedings are defined as all matters in which the intervention of a judge is requested or is necessary without there being actual litigation, or which are not instituted against known and determinate parties. Under this classification fall surveys and demarcations. With reference to voluntary proceedings, it is provided by the Code of Civil Procedure as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"ART. 1800. If opposition to the request be made by any person interested the matter shall become litigious without altering the situation of the parties in interest or the subject-matter of the proceedings, and the procedure prescribed for ordinary actions shall be followed according to the import thereof.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Under this provision of law the opposition of the town of Pasay seems to have been made and filed. The questions for the determination of this appeal are therefore: First, was the town of Pasay a party  \"interested\" within the meaning of this article; and, second, will its opposition duly filed terminate the survey and demarcation of the land as attempted by the plaintiff? The opinion of the majority of the court is based upon the affirmative view of the questions. I am inclined to the opposite view. it is said in the opinion that it needs no argument to show that the owner is interested in the survey of his own land. The converse is equally true. But these self-evident propositions do not tend in any way to elucidate the questions. The proceeding is intended simply for the determination of the boundary line and can have no other effect, and none can be interested except those who are interested in the location and demarcation of these lines. The proceedings are necessarily confined to adjoining owners, and the fact of establishing the lines can not in any way affect those who do not occupy such position. <br/><br/>It is not contended that the town of Pasay abuts on any line attempted to be surveyed nor that any of its streets form such lines. It has not been made a party to the proceedings, nor is there any attempt to bind it. In his amended petition the plaintiff names as parties owners entirely outside the limits of the hacienda, they being the only persons who are interested in the boundary line. It did not concern the town of Pasay in any manner whether this line was pressed in or forced out so long as the parties engaged in making the survey did not intrude upon its possession. The bare possibility of such a result would not make it an interested party and give it the status of an adjoining property owner. The provision of law with reference to the filing of an opposition expressly and clearly limits the right to the owner of adjoining property, and the discontinuance of the voluntary proceedings takes effect only as to that part of the land which adjoins that of the opposing party. As to other adjoining owners who do not object to the continuation of the survey, article 2029 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:  \"If before commencing the survey opposition be made thereto by any owner of adjoining property, the survey of that part of the land which adjoins that of the opposing party shall be discontinued, the parties reserving the right to institute such declarative action therefor as may be proper. A similar discontinuance shall be ordered if any opposition is presented during the proceedings, provided the parties in interest do not agree upon the matter in dispute. In both cases the survey of the balance of the land may be performed at the request of the petitioner, provided the other adjoining owners do not make opposition thereto.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>I do not consider this article of the Code as in any way conflicting with the provisions of article 1800, which gives the right to any person interested to file opposition and to convert the voluntary proceeding into a contentious proceeding, because, as above stated, the town of Pasay is in no way interested in the boundary line. If such a conflict does exist, the general provision contained in article 1800 must give way to the more specific provision which is contained in article 2029, not only according to the ordinary rules of construction but by the express provisions of article 1807, which reads as follows:  \"The provisions prescribed in the preceding articles (including 1800) shall be applicable to special proceedings specially mentioned in the titles following except in so far as the provisions may be opposed thereto.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The case has been tried upon the theory, which the opinion of the majority of the court recognizes, that the town of Pasay is situated entirely within the boundaries of the hacienda and does not adjoin the tract which plaintiffs attempt to survey. <br/><br/>It would be a sufficient answer to the objections or opposition which is made to say that it is not shown that the town of Pasay  \"is the owner of any adjoining property,\" and therefore does not come within the provisions of article 2029. <br/><br/>I do not understand that the case of the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company states a contrary doctrine and that any person interested may, without declaring the nature of his claim, file opposition to a voluntary proceeding and so terminate it. That case was a voluntary proceeding for the judicial possession of land, and the opposition was made by one in possession without disclosing the nature of his title, simply stating his possession. This was a specific statement of the nature of his claim, and his possession was of itself sufficient to justify him in objecting to the voluntary proceeding for possession. <br/><br/>The opposition at Pasay wholly fails to show that it is interested as the owner of an adjoining tract of land. On the contrary it clearly shows that, while it is within the limits of the outer boundary lines described in plaintiff’s petition, the town tract does not touch the boundary lines which plaintiff is attempting to survey. <br/><br/>Other reasons might be given which would lead to the reversal of the judgment of the lower court, but those stated are sufficient to determine the case upon its merits. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, also dissented. </div>'\n",

Notwithstanding this, it seems that the attorney failed to appear at the trial to represent him, and the burden fell upon him to make his own defense. <br/><br/>Under General Orders, No. 58, if the defendant appears without counsel he must be informed by the court that he has a right to have counsel before being arraigned, and must be asked if he desires the aid of counsel. If he desires and is unable to employ counsel the court must assign counsel to defend him. (Sec. 17.) This is a right which the defendant should not be deprived of, and the failure of the court to assign counsel or, after counsel has been assigned, to require him to perform this duty by appearing and defending the accused would be sufficient cause for the reversal of the case. <br/><br/>For this reason it will be necessary to remand this case for a new trial, at which the defendant must be assigned counsel for his defense. <br/><br/>It is so ordered and directed, and the costs of this appeal are adjudged de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I can not agree with the opinion of the court in this case. It appears that at the request of the defendant on the day before the trial the court appointed a lawyer to defend him. At the trial this lawyer not appearing, the defendant conducted his own defense and cross-examined some of the witnesses. As far as the record shows he made no objection to proceeding without the presence of his lawyer. Why that lawyer was not present does not appear. Upon this record the majority of the court reverse the judgment for a non-compliance with section 17 of General Orders, No. 58. As a matter of fact the court did comply with section 17 and did nominate a lawyer for the defense. In the absence of any showing to the contrary we ought to assume that the judge would not have proceeded with the case in the absence of this lawyer unless there was some good reason for doing so. He had recognized the right of the defendant to have counsel by appointing such counsel. It is not credible that the next day he would have ignored the right of the defendant to this protection. For the purpose of reversing the judgment we ought not to presume that the court neglected his duty which he must then have had in mind; we ought rather to presume that the defendant consented to proceed without the presence of his lawyer; his conduct shows this. <br/><br/>I think that the judgment should be affirmed. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The judge below acted correctly, in our opinion, in classifying the facts in the case as constituting the crime of homicide. The evidence is insufficient to show that any of the specific circumstances established by article 403 as constitutive of the crime of murder were present in the commission of the crime. <br/><br/>It is true that the defendant testified that Martin Evangelista was killed by one Venancio Cariaga while bound elbow to elbow. This testimony is the only evidence in the record upon this point. If this circumstance were true it would be unquestionable that the crime was committed treacherously (con alevosia), and should therefore be classified as homicide, as urged by counsel for the Government in this instance; but we can not admit the testimony of Valdez as true in any degree, not even in so far as it might be prejudicial to him, by reason of the fact that he gave this testimony for the sole and exclusive purpose of incriminating another to exculpate himself, evidently falsely stating the facts and circumstances in such a manner that it would be unwise, in our judgment, to accept any of his testimony as the foundation of a decision. We are of the opinion that it was his purpose to entirely disregard the truth, his sole purpose being to incriminate another. For these reasons this testimony can not properly be considered a confession of the defendant, but should be regarded as testimony given for the purpose of injuring a third person. Consequently it should be accepted only in so far as it is corroborated by other data in the record. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the judgment appealed should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an action to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff’s by reason of the defendants’ wrongful occupancy of certain warehouses in Manila from the 2d to the 14th of May, 1900, inclusive. The buildings in question were the property of Luis R. Yangco, and had been leased by him in July, 1899, to the military government of the United States, by which they had been subject to the defendants under an arrangement the details ’of which it is not necessary to state. Yangco objected to the occupancy of the buildings by the defendants, and on the 11th of April, 1900, the Chief Quartermaster of the Army, acting apparently under a misapprehension as to the facts respecting the defendants’ arrangement with the Government, addressed a letter to them, stating that the records of the office failed to show that they had any right to the occupancy of the buildings, and requesting that they be vacated at once. On the 30th of April the lease from Yangco to the Government was terminated by mutual consent. On the 1st of May, Yangco leased the buildings to the plaintiffs for one year. On the same day the plaintiffs notified the defendants of the lease, and requested them to vacate the buildings within twenty-four hours. This the defendants declined to do, and continued’ in the occupancy of the warehouses, or some of them, to the exclusion of the plaintiffs, till subsequently to the 14th of May. The judgment in the court below was in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiffs appealed. <br/><br/>The decision of this case does not involve the determination of the character of the defendants’ occupancy of the warehouses, whether wrongful or otherwise, as between them and the Government, or as between them and Yangco. The only question is whether the defendants have failed to perform any duty which they owed to the plaintiffs. Whatever rights the plaintiffs had in the premises during the period in question, viz, from the 2d to the 14th of May, originated in and depended upon their contract with Yangco for the lease of the buildings. Not having entered into possession under their lease, they had acquired no rights in the leased property in the nature of rights in rem, and which third persons were therefore bound not to infringe. Article 1560 of the Civil Code, which gives the lessee a direct action against a trespasser, is confined to the case of an actual interference with the lessee’s use of the property. Here such use by the plaintiffs had not begun when the alleged wrongs were committed. <br/><br/>Article 1902 of the Civil Code, relied upon by the plaintiffs, established the general principle of liability for damage caused by fault or negligence, but there can be no fault or negligence where, as in the present case, there was no obligation resting upon the person causing the damage to exercise diligence as respects the injured person. <br/><br/>The failure to establish any legal relation between the parties, giving rise to rights in the plaintiffs and corresponding duties on the part of the defendants, as respects the occupancy of the buildings in question, is fatal to the plaintiffs’ recovery in this action. Their remedy, if they have any, is against the lessor, under articles 1554 and 1556 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.

The complaint charges the accused with having subsequently possessed himself of 20 pesos and some pieces of cloth which the deceased was carrying. <br/><br/>The defendant pleaded not guilty, and at the trial stated that the person who killed Juan Castro was Domingo Sipagan, and that the four pieces of cloth which were shown him had been found in his possession and were part of those which Castro was carrying, but that they had been given him by Sipagan as a present. <br/><br/>The only witness who charges him with the crime of homicide and the robbery of the cloth is Domingo Sipagan himself, who says that he started, in company with Juan Castro, to go to a Callingas fiesta; that the accused, the Moro Samarin, sprang upon them in the road and gave Castro a cut, inflicting upon him a wound running from the base of the neck down to the breast on the right side; that the accused then seized several pieces of cloth — the same pieces which were shown him at the trial — and that then he, Sipagan, fearing that he might also be killed, ran away; that he does not know who picked up the body, and can not say whether the deceased had any money. <br/><br/>Domingo Ibarra says that he accompanied the local president of Ilagan to look for the body at the place indicated by the last witness, but that they could not find the body nor did they see anything there to attract their attention.

This instrument recites that the notary went to the house No. 4 David Street, in the district above mentioned, for the purpose of authenticating the execution of this instrument. It also recites the sale by Antonio Enriquez to Concepcion Dayot of a house belonging to him at No. 14 Baluarte Street, Walled City, Manila, for the sum of 7,150 pesos, and that the vendor had already received the sum of 4,484 pesos on account of the purchase price. The notary certified in the instrument that Antonio Enriquez stated he had the necessary legal capability for the execution of this instrument, and that in the opinion of the notary this was true. He also certified that the parties to the instrument were personally known to him, that they personally appeared before him, and that the contract was executed in the presence of the witnesses Ambrosio Aquino and Mariano Palacio. The instrument is signed by the latter and by Concepcion Dayot. With respect to the other party to the contract, the deed contains the following statement:  \"The vendor, Antonio Enriquez, being unable to sign for himself, because, although in good health, he is physically unable to sign by reason of the paralysis of his right hand, his son, Francisco Enriquez, here present, signs at his request.\" The notary also certified to his personal acquaintance with Francisco Enriquez. <br/><br/>The complainants charge Francisco Enriquez with having committed a falsification in the execution of the instrument in question by falsely simulating the participation of Antonio Enriquez and by attributing to him the statements contained therein, it being charged that these statements and such participation are wholly false, because on the date in question the said Antonio was physically and mentally incapable of executing the instrument referred to. <br/><br/>This incapability the complainants allege to be the result of a cerebral hemorrhage suffered by Antonio Enriquez in October, 1882. They assert as a fact that in consequence of this hemorrhage Antonio Enriquez became paralyzed and totally deprived of reason and speech; that he was constantly, from that time on and up to the time of his death in the month of July, 1884, in a completely imbecile condition and therefore absolutely incapable of making contracts and executing public instruments. <br/><br/>The evidence introduced shows it to be a fact that Antonio Enriquez suffered a hemorrhage in October, 1882, which resulted in the paralysis of the entire right side of his body, and that in consequence he lost his speech and the use of his intellectual faculties for a more or less lengthy period of time, the duration of which is not clearly determined in the record. But we do not consider the evidence to be sufficient to show that subsequently to that time he never recovered his reason or that at the date of the execution of the deed alleged to have been falsified, to wit, on February 14, 1883, he was physically and mentally incapable of executing the same, as affirmed and maintained by the complainants. <br/><br/>In the first place, the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution does not agree as to the degree and persistence of the effects produced by the illness of Antonio Enriquez. Trinidad Enriquez, a sister of the complainants, testified that Don Antonio remained in such a condition that he could not speak or walk or move or recognize any one; that he had become, as she says, completely idiotic, the witness giving it to be understood that he remained constantly in this idiotic condition up to the time of his death. Another witness, Carmen Gonzalez, also avers that Don Antonio was deprived of his speech from the time he fell ill until he embarked for Europe (at the end of March or the beginning of April, 1883); but, on the other hand, she says that some days he was better; that sometimes he was rational, and at others not. Luis Quintos, also a witness for the prosecution, testifies, on the other hand, in effect that Antonio Enriquez recovered his speech, although he spoke with difficulty and incoherently. According to this witness he went to see Don Antonio two or three times for the purpose of transacting some business with him in connection with the inheritance of his wife. The first visit was about the beginning of his illness, and the last shortly before his departure for Europe. He testifies that on neither of these occasions did he succeed in attaining his purpose, because they could not reach an understanding, as Don Antonio was unable to answer him clearly.  \"The replies he gave me,\" says the witness,  \"although spoken most laboriously, I could not understand, because I wanted to say one thing and he answered me about something else.\" The same witness says that on one of those occasions he talked to Don Antonio for about half an hour; but states, however, that during that period he remained silent for a short time, and that he did not continue talking about his business, but about the illness (Don Antonio’s, he doubtless meant to say).  \"I do not think,\" adds the witness,  \"that Don Antonio was mentally unbalanced, but as he did not talk about what I was saying I withdrew.\" Nevertheless, upon being asked to give his concrete opinion with respect to Don Antonio’s mental condition, he stated that he believed the latter was incapacitated because he could not give a consistent answer to his questions. It appears that the witness bases this opinion upon the fact that when he said to Don Antonio,  \"Let us see if we can not make a satisfactory arrangement about the matter,\" Don Antonio replied to him by saying,  \"I know nothing about it.\" This reply, considered in itself, does not in our opinion appear to be so inconsistent as the witness regards it, but might well be interpreted as an intentional evasion, for the purpose of not going into the matter which the witness desired to discuss with Don Antonio. <br/><br/>At all events, it is evident that the testimony of Luis Quintos is in open contradiction with that of Trinidad Enriquez and Carmen Gonzalez. It would have been absolutely impossible for him to have had a more or less lengthy conversation with Don Antonio Enriquez, even if his answers, in the opinion of the witness, were inconsistent, if it were true that Don Antonio had never recovered his speech, as affirmed by Trinidad and Carmen. <br/><br/>The testimony of Agueda Esteban, another witness for the prosecution, is of but little interest in the case. She simply testifies that the illness of Don Antonio Enriquez consisted in his being unable to speak, but without stating whether or not he ever recovered from it. As the only concrete fact which she adduces in support of her assertion the witness states that upon one occasion she approached Don Antonio to complain about the determination of the accused to evict herself and her family from the Teatro Viejo, where they lived, the property, apparently, of Don Antonio, and that the latter did not reply to her, because he could not speak. This occurred, according to her statement, about the middle of 1882, the fact being that Don Antonio fell ill in October of that year. This detail shows how uncertain is the memory of the witness, more especially if it is held in mind that in one part of her testimony she says that she was evicted from the Teatro Viejo by the accused after Don Antonio went to Spain, and in another place states that this occurred while Don Antonio was still in the city of Manila. <br/><br/>The testimony of Julian de las Cajigas is of still less importance. This witness was also called by the complainants, and his testimony refers exclusively to the condition in which he saw Don Antonio Enriquez while in Paris. He did not see him once during the time he was ill in this city. <br/><br/>One of the proofs presented by the prosecution is the letter written by the accused on December 30, 1882, to the now complainant, Rafael Enriquez, who was then in Paris, informing him of the illness of Don Antonio, their father, and of his condition at that time. The authenticity of this letter has been admitted by the accused, who also offered it as evidence for the defense, and it therefore has the force of evidence admitted and accepted by both parties. Now, in that letter it is stated, it is true, that Antonio Enriquez had suffered, some days after the 10th of October, 1882, an attack of paralysis, complicated with hemorrhage of the brain, which completely deprived him of movement and of speech, and that the gravity of the attack was such that at first his family, despaired of saving him; bit it is also true that the letter itself states that some weeks after the attack the patient commenced to improve, slowly at first but rapidly and notably subsequently, to such an extent that at the date of the letter he was able to walk about the house, with the help only of a little girl, and although he had not yet recovered his speech, he was, however, already able to pronounce clearly a number of words.  \"The doctor,\" adds the letter,  \"hopes that he will very soon be able to speak; he [Don Antonio] already eats with us at the table, . . . and at this rate I hope that by the end of January he will be able to walk without assistance.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>From this letter it can not properly be inferred that Antonio Enriquez was physically and mentally incapacitated on the 14th of February, 1883, for the execution of the instrument in question. On the contrary, if on the 30th of December, 1882, the date on which the letter was written, he was already able to walk all over the house alone, with the slight assistance of a little girl, and was already able to clearly pronounce a number of words, it is in nowise improbable, in our opinion, that his improvement should have been still more marked in every way a month and a half later, unless he had suffered, in the meantime, some relapse. This, however, does not appear from the record. <br/><br/>We do not consider it necessary to concern ourselves with the opinion of Drs. Manuel Xerez y Burgos and Manuel Garcia Ageo, cited by the complainants, to the effect that Antonio Enriquez was absolutely incapacitated. This opinion, founded as it is upon the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution and upon the contents of the letter of December 30, 1882, already spoken of above (for it does not appear that these physicians personally attended Don Antonio), we are unable to give greater weight than that to which it is entitled relatively to the weight which should be given the statements and the letter themselves. It should also be stated that the opinion referred to has been impugned and contradicted in its technical part by Drs. Altmann and Garcia del Rey, called by the defense, who testified that from the evidence in the case it was not possible to draw a sufficiently clear conclusion to form an opinion as to the diagnosis of the illness suffered by Don Antonio, and of its consequences, and that therefore  \"it can not be affirmed that the latter remained in the condition stated by the doctors Xerez y Burgos and Garcia Ageo.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In addition to the testimony of these doctors, Messrs. Altmann and del Rey, the defense introduced documentary and oral evidence to demonstrate the capability of Antonio Enriquez at the time of the execution of the deed in question. The oral testimony consists of the declaration of Venancio Ruiz, who says that as solicitor of Jose Roman he filed a complaint against Don Antonio Enriquez for the recovery of a sum of money in February or March, 1883, and that upon service on the latter of the summons, as he was ill, he sent for the witness; that on his arrival Don Antonio said to him,  \"What is this against me?\" \"A complaint of Jose Roman concerning a sum of money,\" replied the witness. To this Don Antonio replied,  \"Well, I want that complaint to be withdrawn. I am going to Spain, and I want that complaint withdrawn. Make arrangements with my lawyer, Antonio Gomez.\" The witness states that the conversation continued for ten or fifteen minutes, and that Don Antonio spoke readily, and that he understood him very well, although he observed that he had some difficulty in enunciation. He also adds that during the entire conversation Don Antonio was standing up, leaning on a stick; but the witness noticed, however, that he walked with some difficulty. <br/><br/>The documentary evidence consists, in the first place (1) of a public instrument purporting to have been executed by Antonio Enriquez before the notary public Miguel Torres on the 5th of March, 1883, conferring a power of attorney on his son, Francisco, to represent him in all his affairs and to manage his property, in which instrument it appears that Attorney Federico Gimenez Zoboli signed at the request of Don Antonio, the donor of the power, he being unable to do so himself on account of the disability of his right hand; (2) a copy of an order entered on the 19th of February, 1883, in a case brought in the Court of Intramuros (Manila) by Francisco de Paula Enriquez, in which it is stated that Don Antonio Enriquez has expressed his approval of the taxation of costs in the said case; (3) copy of the record of demand of payment of said costs made personally upon Antonio Enriquez in his house on March 4, 1883, in which record it appears that he himself at that time gave a comparatively long answer, which, as it is unconnected with the case at bar, it is unnecessary for us to repeat. These copies were not impugned by the prosecution and have apparently been compared with their originals. <br/><br/>The authenticity of these documents being taken for granted — and they must be presumed to be authentic until their falsity is shown, owing to their legal character as solemn public instruments — we must necessarily admit the reality of Don Antonio Enriquez’s participation therein and of the statements therein alleged to have been made by Don Antonio. From this point of view these documents must be regarded as strong evidence as to the capacity of Don Antonio at the time of the execution of the instrument in question, because it is indubitable that he could not have personally participated in the proceedings to which these documents refer, or have made these statements, if he had been physically and mentally incapacitated, as asserted by the complainants. <br/><br/>Part of the documentary evidence of the defense consists of certain letters of a date subsequent to that of the instrument in question, written from Paris by the complainant, Rafael Enriquez, to his brother, Francisco, the defendant herein, the authenticity of which was admitted by Rafael at the trial. These letters corroborate the fact, flatly denied by some of the witnesses for the prosecution, that Antonio Enriquez had really attained a positive and notable improvement during his illness. Thus, for example, in the letter of June 1, 1883, Rafael says:  \"Father has improved noticeably during the eleven days we have been here. He goes out with me on foot every day, and with little difficulty goes up and down stairs twice a day to the room in which we live; . . . the improvement in his health points to a complete recovery in a few months.\" In his letter of the 28th of the same month of June he says,  \"His mind is quite clear, and he talks to me about everything, and particularly about the little girls.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Finally, the record contains a letter written to the accused by Don Antonio from Paris, dated September 30, 1883, signed in his own handwriting, as admitted by the complainant, Rafael, himself. In this letter he speaks of some accounts and the sending of money, giving the accused instructions for a certain business transaction, just as any completely sane person might do. The explanation which Rafael has endeavored to give concerning this letter, to the effect that he guided his father’s hand in the signing of it, apart from the fact that it is wholly unproven, we consider to be of but little importance after what he himself has said in his letters with respect to the physical and mental condition of Don Antonio Enriquez. <br/><br/>In view of the result of the evidence introduced in the case we are of the opinion that the falsity of the instrument of February 14, 1883, the object of the complaint, has not been proven. This instrument, having been executed before a notary public, and being, therefore, a public document, carries with it the legal presumption of its authenticity until the contrary is fully established. <br/><br/>This conclusion having been reached, it is wholly unnecessary to pass upon the question raised by the defense as to the prescription of the alleged crime, and therefore we make no ruling upon this point. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the judgment appealed, by which the accused was acquitted, must be affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The complaint charges the defendant with the crime of estafa and falsification, and alleges that he, while an employee of the Manila-Dagupan Railway, on the 18th of July, 1901, in the vicinity of the Province of Manila, issued a ticket to a passenger who was going from Manila to Caloocan, and who continued his trip to Malolos; that the difference in the fare amounted to 1 peso and 22 cents; that the ticket issued simulated that the trip was from Manila to Bocaue and the charge only 18 cents; and that he rendered account to the company for this amount, appropriating the balance of the sum received. <br/><br/>It appears, therefore, that the complaint does not precisely designate the place where the falsification was committed, nor where occurred the appropriation of the money with which the accused is charged. The testimony introduced has not resulted in determining the first point, but this is not the case with respect to the second. It appears from the testimony of the accused himself that he rendered an account, to the station master at Tarlac, of the money collected on the trip in question that he there delivered the money collected during the trip, amounting to 6 pesos and 48 cents, and that there also, finally, he delivered the stub in which, it is charged, the simulation or falsification denounced was committed. There is nothing in the record to contradict or offset the testimony of the accused. In addition to his testimony the record discloses an itemized account of the collections made by him on the trip in question, in which appears the entry corresponding to the stub alleged to have been falsified. This document is dated in Tarlac and contains an invoice of delivery, signed by the accused, and a receipt, signed by the station master at that point, for the sum of 6 pesos and 48 cents. As part of this sum is included the 18 cents entered on the stub in question which appears as one of the vouchers of the account referred to. This document fully corroborates the statements of the accused, and these facts considered together constitute in our judgment a sufficient demonstration that the appropriation of the difference resulting between the sum of 18 cents entered on the stub and the 1 peso and 22 cents actually collected as charged in the complaint was consummated in Tarlac, and that in Tarlac, also, he made use of the stub referred to in rendering an account of the trip in question, and delivering the amount collected to the station master at that point. <br/><br/>This being so, under article 20 of the General Compilation of Laws upon Criminal Procedure, jurisdiction to try the offense charged is vested in the court of Tarlac, not only because it was within the territory of that court that the appropriation constituting the crime of estafa charged was committed, but also because within the same territory the accused made use of the document alleged to be false, it not appearing with certainty, on the other hand, at what place the falsification was committed. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of October 7, 1896.) <br/><br/>The fact that the Court of First Instance of Manila took jurisdiction of the offense charged, because, in the opinion of the court, the place of the commission of the crime was not clearly shown, is not an obstacle to the court’s declarating itself to be without jurisdiction as soon as the lack of jurisdiction appeared from proceedings subsequently had. Jurisdiction over criminal case can not be conferred by consent. (Art. 23 of the compilation above cited.) <br/><br/>We therefore affirm the order appealed, with the costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The accused is charged with the crime of perjury. The complaint alleges that in the criminal case. brought against Gabriel Dancel for discharging a firearm and for lesiones menos graves inflicted upon Miguel Marunao the accused testified that Dancel fired one shot from the gun, which caused the death of Eustrasio Guerrero and at the same time wounded Marunao, the fact being that there were really two shots fired, the first killing Guerrero and the second wounding Marunao. <br/><br/>From the transcripts taken from the record of the case against Gabriel Dancel, it appears that the accused herein was not the only witness who testified that there was only one discharge of the gun, but that four other witnesses named Pablo Antonio, Escolastico Laureta, Rafael Dancel, and Pedro Asuncion, testified to the same effect; that is, that Gabriel Dancel fired the gun but once, while three other witnesses, Andres Arcellano, Damaso Arcellano, and Juan Sahagun, testified that the gun was fired twice, the first shot killing Eustrasio Guerrero and the second wounding Miguel Marunao. <br/><br/>The evidence introduced in this case produces an equally contradictory result. While the prosecution called four witnesses who testified that there were two shots, the defense presented four witnesses who testified in the completely contrary sense, affirming that there was only one shot fired. The latter witnesses were near the place of the occurrence and were those who conveyed the body of Eustrasio Guerrero to the town. They testified that if there had been two shots they must necessarily have heard them, owing to the short distance between them and the place of the occurrence. These witnesses did not take part in the quarrel and consequently were able to preserve the presence of mind necessary to observe the principal details of the event, so far as susceptible of perception by the senses. <br/><br/>The witnesses for the prosecution, who all participated in the occurrence in which Gabriel Dancel made use of the gun, testified that upon hearing the first shot they were frightened and ran away, and that they were still running when they heard the second shot. This being so, it is not easy to understand how they can testify that it was the second shot which wounded Marunao, when at that time, according to their own statement, each one was in full flight. Marunao himself testified that he was wounded while he was running, but nevertheless an examination of his wound shows that it took effect on the knee, which would appear to indicate that he received it while he was facing the aggressor. <br/><br/>The experts who made the examination, as appears from the transcript of the record of the proceedings in the case expressed the opinion that it was very possible that Marunao might have been wounded by the same shot which caused the death of Eustrasio Guerrero, and not only that they believe it possible, but that they are inclined to think this is actually what occurred, in view of the distances and the position in which both victims were standing with respect to the aggressor, and considering the other circumstances of the case. <br/><br/>Upon the merits of the case we can not with certainty reach the conclusion that the accused perverted the truth when testifying that Gabriel Dancel fired only one shot on the occasion referred to. <br/><br/>We therefore decide that the accused must be acquitted, and the judgment below is therefore reversed, with the costs of both instances de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

One of those terms was contained in condition  \"A\" of the contract entered into by the parties litigant, according to which the tenants under no circumstances or pretext whatever were to sublease the property or to assign or convey their rights to any other person. It appears that the two lessees did not take part in the suit and that the complaint was opposed by the Chinaman Tan Ching Kay, represented by his attorney, as partner of the defendant lessees. Upon examination at the trial he admitted that he was a partner of the defendants and manager of the firm, with an interest in the business. Being asked if it was true that the Chinaman Ching Sang paid him the sum of 120 pesos a month as rent for the upper story and part of the lower story of the house in question, he replied twice in the affirmative. The only legal argument made by the defense upon this point is that in the clause referred to the sublease of the whole house is prohibited, but not that of part of it. As the clause in the contract absolutely prohibits a sublease, a natural understanding of this is that any sublease is prohibited, and no statute or principle of law supports an interpretation of the contract in the sense of a partial sublease being allowable, although a total sublease is prohibited. <br/><br/>Therefore the judgment directing an eviction of the defendants with the costs is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the appellants. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Don Jose Zulueta and his sister, Doña Francisca Zulueta, are sole heirs under the will of their father, Don Clementa Zulueta, who died in Iloilo in 1900. In the course of the voluntary testamentary proceedings instituted in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo by Don Jose, three auditors were appointed to make a division of the estate under article 1053 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil, of whom Don Jose and Doña Francisca each nominated one, the third or auditor umpire being chosen by common accord of the parties. The two auditors nominated by the parties respectively failed to agree, and each rendered a separate report. The auditor umpire, whose report was filed March 29, 1901, agreed with and accepted in its entirety the report of the auditor nominated by Don Jose. The procedure marked out in articles 1062 and 1067 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil was then followed, and upon the application of Doña Francisca the record was on April 13 delivered to her for examination. April 25 she filed her opposition to the report of the auditor umpire, and a meeting of the interested parties having been had, as provided in article 1069 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil, and no agreement having been reached, the court, by a providencia of May 4, directed that the procedure prescribed for declarative actions be followed, and that the record be again delivered to Doña Francisca in order that she might formulate her demand in accordance with article 1071 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. On petition of Don Jose the court by a providencia of May 7 fixed the term of fifteen days as that within which Doña Francisca should formulate her demand, which term was subsequently enlarged seven days on petition of Doña Francisca. June 5 Doña Francisca petitioned the court, stating that the new Code of Procedure enacted by the Civil Commission was soon to become operative, and that she deemed it more advantageous to her rights that the declarative action which she had to bring should be governed by the new Code rather than that then in force, and asking that proceedings in the action should be suspended till the new Code went into effect. This petition the court denied in an auto rendered June 15, declaring, furthermore, that the term fixed for the filing of the demand having expired, Doña Francisca had lost her right to institute the action. June 22 Doña Francisca petitioned for the reform of this auto. On the same day this petition was denied in an auto rendered by Don Cirilo Mapa, a justice of the peace of the city of Iloilo, who had been designated, as would appear from the record, by the judge of the then recently constituted Ninth Judicial District to preside in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Iloilo during the illness of the latter. The denial of this petition was put on the ground that the auto of June 15 was not one against which the remedy of reform was available, but that the remedy was by way of appeal under article 365 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. On June 29 Doña Francisca interposed an appeal against the auto of June 22, which the court, now presided over by the regular judge of first instance of the district, declined to admit, on the ground that it was not presented within three days, as prescribed in article 363 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. Thereupon, upon petition of Don Jose the partition proceedings were approved by the court by an auto of July 16 from which Doña Francisca took the present appeal. <br/><br/>While the appeal was pending in this court Doña Francisca presented a petition under Act No. 75 of the Civil Commission, alleging that the auto of June 22 was rendered through a mistake of the acting judge of first instance, who erroneously believed that he had jurisdiction to render the same; that Doña Francisca was prevented from entering an appeal from that auto by her mistake as to the term prescribed by the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil for entering appeals in such cases; and finally that the auto of July 16 approving the partition proceedings was rendered by a mistake of the judge, who erroneously believed that the auto of June 22 was valid, whereas it and all subsequent proceedings were absolutely void; and asking that the auto of June 22, the providencia denying the admission of the appeal, and the auto of July 16 be set aside and the proceedings restored to the condition in which they were previous to June 22, when the first mistake was made. Upon this petition a hearing has been had, and we have also heard arguments upon the appeal. <br/><br/>Taking up the petition first, we do not find it necessary to decide whether the acting judge of first instance by whom the auto of June 22 was rendered had such de facto authority that legal validity will be accorded to his acts. Assuming that he was without jurisdiction to render the auto, we are of opinion that Doña Francisca can not take advantage of the error in such a proceeding as the present. Act No. 75 provides a remedy  \"against judgments obtained in Courts of First Instance by fraud, accident, or mistake,\" but although the language of the law is somewhat broad, the general scope and purpose of the enactment indicate too clearly to require argument that the mistake against which relief is provided can not be a mistake into which the court may have fallen in the findings of fact or conclusions of law upon which its judgment is based. If such were the effect of the enactment, every case in which a party felt himself aggrieved by the judgment of the court below could be brought to this court for revision in this way, and the ordinary remedy by appeal or otherwise would be thus entirely superseded by the more summary proceeding therein provided.  \"The meaning of the word ’mistake’ as used in the statute does not extend — nor was it intended that it should — to an error of law which may have been committed by the judge in the trial in question. Such errors may be corrected by appeal. The statute under consideration can by no means be employed as a substitute for that remedy.\" (Jose Emeterio Guevara v. Tuason &amp; Company, decided October 7, 1901, p. 27, supra.) The result is that we can not set aside the auto of June 22 on this petition, and that of July 16 stands upon precisely the same footing, the allegation being that auto also was rendered under a mistake of law on the part of the judge. <br/><br/>The remaining question upon the petition is whether Doña Francisca is entitled to relief against the consequences of her failure to interpose her appeal against the auto of June 22 within the period fixed by the law. The mistake in this instance was her own, but it was a mistake of law, and while we should be unwilling to say that special cases might not occur in which relief would be afforded in such a proceeding as this against a mistake of law made by a party, we are of opinion that the present is not such a case. Nothing is shown here except the bare fact that the party acted under ignorance or misconception of the provisions of the law in regard to the time within which the appeal could be taken, and there is no reason why the general principle, a principle  \"founded not only on expediency and policy but on necessity,\" that  \"ignorance of the law does not excuse from compliance therewith\" (Civil Code, art. 2), should be relaxed. The framers of Act No. 75 could not have intended to totally abrogate this principle with reference to the class of CASEs covered by the act. If such were the effect of this legislation the court  \"would be involved and perplexed with questions incapable of any just solution and embarrassed by inquiries almost interminable.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Act No. 75 was framed for the purpose of preventing injustice, and although the legal construction to be placed upon its provisions can not of course be affected by any considerations as to the hardships of the particular CASE in which it is invoked, it is proper to say that if the question determined in the auto of June 15, which is that against the consequences of which the petitioner seeks ultimately to be relieved, were to be decided upon its merits, that auto would necessarily be sustained, so that the petitioner has in fact suffered no hardship or injustice by reason of the auto having been left in effect as a result of the mistakes which she claims to have vitiated the subsequent proceedings. <br/><br/>The petition for the suspension of the declarative action till the new Code went into effect was totally without merit. No reason was alleged in the petition itself why the suspension should be granted other than the mere convenience of the party, and none has been suggested on the argument. The petition could not in any possible view that occurs to us have been granted. With reference to the declaration in the auto that the plaintiff had lost her right to file her demand in the declarative action, it may be said that this declaration followed as a necessary consequence from the providencia of May 7, fixing the time within which the demand must be formulated, and the subsequent providencia enlarging the period, from neither of which providencias had any appeal or other remedy been attempted by Doña Francisca. But going back to what may be called the fundamental question of the right of the court to fix a definite term within which the declarative action must be instituted, we are of opinion that such right clearly existed, and that the providencia of May 7 was in exact conformity with the procedure prescribed by article 1971 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. It might be claimed with much reason that if the parties interested in the partition of the estate failed to agree on that made by the auditor, either should be allowed to institute a declarative action against the other for the purpose of setting the dispute within such time as he might think proper, the property remaining in the meantime undivided, were it not that the law in language of unmistakable import prescribes a different rule of procedure. Article 1071 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil is as follows:  \"If no agreement is had, the procedure prescribed for declarative actions, according to the amount involved, shall be followed, and the delivery of the papers shall be first made to the parties who first requested delivery to them of the partition report as provided in article 1067.\" Article 1067 is as follows:  \"If the interested parties, or any of them, request, within eight days, that the record of the proceedings and the report on partition be delivered to them for examination, the judge shall order said delivery for a period of fifteen days to each person making such request.\" The law does not treat the partition proceedings as terminated by the failure of the parties to agree, but provides that  \"the case\" shall in that event  \"be given the procedure of the declarative action\" and goes on to designate the party who is to take the initiative in the pleadings, a provision utterly irreconcilable with the idea that it is optional for either party to commence the proceeding at his pleasure. And it then proceeds by reference to article 1067 to fix the time within which the proceeding is to be instituted. The petitioner had the benefit of that period and was accorded besides an extension of seven days, and has consequently had all the rights to which she was strictly entitled under the law and something more. She has, we think, no just ground to complain that she has been deprived of any substantial right either by her own mistake or that of the court below, in any possible view in which the facts of the case maybe regarded. <br/><br/>What has been said with reference to the petition disposes also of the question involved in the appeal. If Doña Francisca had, as we think must be the case, lost her right to institute the declarative action, there was no other course for the court to take except to approve the partition proceedings, unless there was some defect which vitiated them, and none has been pointed out. it was suggested in the argument that the report of the auditor umpire was of prior date to that of the auditor nominated by Don Jose, and it was claimed that this rendered the proceedings defective. An examination of the record shows that the report of the auditor nominated by Don Jose was dated March 24 and filed March 29, and that that of the auditor umpire was dated March 28 and filed March 29. The contention of counsel on this point is therefore not supported by the facts. <br/><br/>The result is that the petition must be denied and the judgment appealed from affirmed, with costs to the appealing party both as to the petition and the appeal. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga, rendered on the 8th day of June, 1901, in favor of the plaintiff, in a summary proceeding instituted by Don Gaudencio Simpao against Don Joaquin Dizon, to recover possession of two tracts of land located in the municipality of Porac. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed from restored to the possession of the plaintiff the two parcels of land in question, and adjudged that the defendant should pay plaintiff all such damages as he might have sustained and costs, reserving to both parties such rights as they might have to the ownership of the land in question, and to the final possession thereof, which rights they may exercise in due time. <br/><br/>The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was the sole owner of the two parcels of land, and that he had been in possession of said lands since June, 1888, having acquired the same at said time from Gaudencio de Mesa by sale with right of repurchase, which title has never since been questioned; that he leased same to Cecilio Lacsamana, of the same town, who has been cultivating the premises during the last two years, but, on account of the unsettled condition of affairs, landowners could not take CASE of their property; and that the defendant, Don Joaquin Dizon, had taken possession of the land in September last, in spite of the opposition of the tenant, Cecilio Lacsamana, and the plaintiff asked that he be restored to the possession of the farms in question. <br/><br/>The answer of the defendant states that he took charge of the cultivation of the land by the express order of the owner, Miguel de Mesa; that Cecilio Lacsamana held it as tenant of Miguel de Mesa, and has refused to pay the rent; that the captain commanding the post at Porac directed the land to be turned over to Miguel de Mesa; that Lacsamana was the person who was ejected from the premises, and that he was the only one who could bring suit for its recovery; that the action can not be maintained against the defendant, Joaquin Dizon, for the reason that the defendant is but the agent of Miguel de Mesa, in charge of the cultivation of the farm, and that what he did was in pursuance of instructions from Mesa. <br/><br/>On the trial of the case the plaintiff offered as evidence a document signed by Gaudencio de Mesa on the 18th of June, 1889, showing a conveyance, with right of redemption (venta con pacto de retro), of the land from the said Gaudencio de Mesa to the plaintiff and in which the tenancy of the lands was acknowledged by Gaudencio de Mesa. The plaintiff also introduced in evidence the certificate from the registrar to the effect that a possessory information had been filed by the plaintiff, and judicial possession awarded him of the two parcels of land on October 18, 1895. The property was again registered in the same office October 12, 1896, as the repository of documents had been destroyed by fire. <br/><br/>The plaintiff also offered in evidence a lease dated September 25, 1898, by which the two parcels of land were leased to Cecilio Lacsamana. <br/><br/>Defendant introduced in evidence a lease made by Anastasio de Mesa and Ariston Jaime to Don Ciriaco Austria of the two parcels of land under consideration, by which the latter was to pay the former the amount of 120 pesos per annum, the lease to cover the property from 1897 to 1898, and after the crop for that year had been harvested. <br/><br/>Both plaintiff and defendant introduced testimony of witnesses as to their respective possession of the property. The plaintiff’s witnesses testified as to the dispossession of Lacsamana by Joaquin Dizon. Cecilio Lacsamana stated that he leased the land from plaintiff, and not from Miguel de Mesa. Defendant offered evidence of many witnesses to the effect that on the death of Gaudencio de mesa, the father of Miguel de Mesa, the latter remained in the possession of the land, and that he leased the land to Lacsamana; that Lacsamana paid a stipulated rent to Miguel de Mesa; that defendant, Joaquin Dizon, was the agent of Mesa, and that it was by order of Miguel de Mesa that he had entered into the possession of the farm and cultivated it. <br/><br/>The testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiff and the defendant is irreconcilable. We think the witnesses for the plaintiff have been corroborated by the documentary evidence referred to. The testimony of Lacsamana shows very clearly that the plaintiff was in possession through him, and that he was dispossessed of the property by the defendant. The documentary evidence corroborated, as stated, the testimony of this witness. The only admissible evidence in summary proceedings of this character is that which has reference to the two issues referred to in article 1634 of the old Code of Civil Procedure, which are: (1) That the claimant was actually in possession or tenancy of the property, and (2) that he had been molested or disturbed in such possession or tenancy by the defendant, or some other person at the instance of said defendant. <br/><br/>The question is presented by the defendant as to whether an action in summary proceedings can be maintained by the owner or lessor. Unquestionably he has a right to maintain the action. Otherwise he might lose his civil possession, and suffer serious inconvenience. <br/><br/>By article 460 of the Civil Code, possession is given to another, even against the will of the former possessor, if the new possession has lasted a year. It is important that the owner should have the right to institute summary proceedings to protect himself against such result. Article 446 of the Civil Code provides that every possessor has the right to be protected in his possession, and should he be disturbed in it he will be protected, or possession restored to him by the means established in the laws of procedure. <br/><br/>Possession of things or rights is exercised either by the same person who holds and enjoys them, or by another in his behalf. (Art. 431 of the Civil Code.) If possession is once acquired, either by material occupancy of the thing or right possessed, or by the fact that the same remains subject to the action of one’s will, it continues in the possessor, and he only loses such possession in one of the modes mentioned in article 460 of the Civil code. <br/><br/>Article 1554 relates to the rights and obligations of lessor and lessee, and makes it the duty of the lessor to maintain the lessee in the peaceable enjoyment of the lease during all the time of the contract. <br/><br/>By article 1559 the lessee is bound to give notice to the owner, with the least possible delay, of any usurpation or injurious alterations which any person may have done or is openly preparing to do to the thing leased. It may be well inferred that the purpose of this notice was to enable the owner to maintain his civil possession, by suit if necessary. The acts of dispossession were committed by the defendant. He can not avail himself of the plea that in committing the wrong he was acting under the directions of some other person. The action will lie both against the party who commits the trespass and against another person at the instance of whom the trespasser is acting. The testimony offered by the plaintiff is sufficient to support the material issues: (1) That the claimant was in actual possession or tenancy of the property, and (2) that he was molested or disturbed in such possession or tenancy by the defendant. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court should be affirmed with costs, which is accordingly done. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Late on a night in January, 1901, some ten or twelve men, armed with bolos and firearms, went to the vicinity of the house of Celedonia Bienes, situated in the barrio of San Antonio, town of San Nicolas, Pangasinan. Some of them entered the house and seized the brothers Francisco and Daniel Gascon, two of its inmates, and in the house next door captured Sotero Alquero, and, binding the three, took them toward the river Agno. While on the road, before reaching the river, they freed Alquero. Upon reaching the river one of the malefactors, who subsequently proved to be Roman Cabe, acting under orders of Francisco Cabe, shot Francisco Gascon, who was standing with his back toward the aggressor. Immediately after, Roman struck Francisco Gascon a blow with a bolo, separating his head from his body, and then threw the body into the river. Upon this Julian Serios, another of the malefactors, struck Daniel Gascon several blows with a bolo, inflicting upon him five wounds. In consequence of the aggression Daniel fell into the river, where, believing him to be dead, the five men left him. Of the five Daniel was able to recognize only the three defendants Francisco and Roman Cabe and Julian Serios, whom he had known previously. After several hours he succeeded in reaching the bank of the river, got out of the water, and returned to his home. His wounds were several months in healing. <br/><br/>Although the three accused pleaded not guilty to the crime of murder, it is unquestionable that they were, with certain other persons unknown, the sole authors, by direct participation, of the violent death of Francisco Gascon. The evidence in the record shows unquestionably that Roman Cabe, obeying the orders of Francisco Cabe, attacked and killed Francisco Gascon in the presence of Julian Serios and his other companions unknown, who, although they took no material part in the execution of the crime, nevertheless gave their moral support, it not appearing that they attempted to prevent its consummation. Furthermore, Julian Serios directly attacked Daniel Gascon, the brother of the victim, who did not die, his wounds proving to be not of a mortal character. <br/><br/>The fact that only one witness testified is not an obstacle to our becoming fully convinced as to the certainty of the occurrence and of the guilt of the defendants, because, in addition to the testimony of this witness, we find grave and conclusive circumstantial evidence, based upon proven facts, such as the sequestration of the deceased and of the witnesses Daniel Gascon and Sotero Alquero by the three accused and seven or nine other individuals unknown; the wounds inflicted upon Daniel; the disappearance of Francisco Gascon, his brother; and the self-contradictory statements of the defendants themselves. <br/><br/>It is unquestionable that the killing of Francisco Gascon was committed with treachery (alevosia). It was executed while he was bound, in the middle of the river and in the hands of the three defendants, assisted by others. It is evident, therefore, that the crime was consummated without any risk to the aggressors arising from an attempt at defense on the part of the victim. Francisco Gascon and Daniel Gascon were policemen under the Americans. One of them had served the Americans as a guide. The two formed part of a gathering of several persons which was assembled that night at the house of Celedonia Bienes. For the purpose of meeting together at that barrio at a given hour and capturing the two brothers, and Sotero Alquero, who was in a neighboring house, and taking them to the river Agno, 3 miles away, and for the purpose of killing one of them, or rather two — although the murder of Daniel was not consummated — it must be supposed that there was a plan and a concerted action, which shows known premeditation on the part of the principals in this crime. to this generic aggravating circumstance must be added the other arising from the commission of the crime by an armed band in an uninhabited place and in the nightime. This, although offset by the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, still leaves the two circumstances first considered, to wit, the qualifying circumstance of known premeditation. These two circumstances being present, no penalty less than the maximum degree of that assigned for the crime of murder can be imposed. <br/><br/>Consequently the judgment of the court below is affirmed, the indemnification imposed in the judgment to be changed to 1,000 pesos. <br/><br/>Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The violent killing of Francisco Gascon, as above related, is a fact fully proven, and constitutes the crime of murder, defined and punished in article 403 of the Penal Code, because in the execution of this crime the qualifying circumstance of treachery (alevosia) was present. The deceased was killed while helpless, with arms bound elbow to elbow, and was unable to defend himself against his aggressor. The latter, furthermore, was assisted or accompanied by some eleven or more armed men. Apart from this should be considered the fact that the victim was wounded by a gunshot fired from behind, the aggression being concluded by severing his head from his body by a blow which certainly must have been received on the back of the neck. <br/><br/>Although the body was not subsequently found, the fact is that the deceased has not been seen since the night in question, nor has any information been received as to his whereabouts. Consequently it is unquestionable that he was killed, as asserted by his brother Daniel, the only eyewitness to the crime. <br/><br/>Although the three accused pleaded not guilty to the crime of murder charged against them, it is indubitable that they, with certain other persons unknown, are the authors, by direct participation, of the violent death of Francisco Gascon. An examination of the record discloses as an unquestionable fact that Roman Cabe, in obedience to orders received from Francisco Cabe, attacked and killed the said Francisco Gascon in the presence of Julian Serios and his other companions unknown. these, although they took no part in the material execution of the crime, nevertheless gave it their moral support, it not appearing that they made any attempt to prevent the consummation of this grave offense. Furthermore, Julian Serios made a direct attack upon Daniel Gascon, the brother of the victim, who did not die, his wounds providing to be not of a mortal character. <br/><br/>The fact that we have the testimony of only one eyewitness to the murder is not an obstacle, within the exercise of a sound discretion, to reaching the conclusion that the defendants are criminally responsible. The statements made by Daniel Gascon and the facts which he related have not been disproven, but, on the contrary, have been corroborated by numerous grave and conclusive items of circumstantial evidence, based upon certain and proven facts, such as the capture of the deceased and the witnesses Daniel Gascon and Sotero Alquero by the three defendants and seven or nine other persons unknown, the wounds inflicted upon Daniel, the disappearance of the latter’s brother, Francisco Gascon, and the lack of proof of the exculpative allegations of the defendants. <br/><br/>These sequestrations do not constitute the crime of illegal detention, because the criminals captured the injured persons, not for the purpose of depriving them of liberty along, but in order to kill them, this being the final object they intended to attain, at all events with respect to the Gascon brothers. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime herein prosecuted the only generic circumstance which should be considered present is that established by paragraph 15 of article 10 of the Code, because the crime was committed by the defendants in an armed band in an uninhabited place and under cover of the darkness of night. these three circumstances, included in one paragraph of the Penal Code, constitute, under the rulings of the supreme court of Spain, a single aggravating circumstance, offset in its effects by the mitigating circumstance indicated in article 11 of the Code. The presence of the latter circumstance should be considered in this case, in view of the personal conditions of the defendants, and the political passions of partisanship, hatred, and revenge which impelled them to the commission of the crime. The undersigned does not believe that it is proper to consider that the aggravating circumstance of premeditation was present, inasmuch as the band which captured the Gascon brothers and the witness Alquero was a more or less numerous gang of thieves who, under the guise of revolutionists, were wandering about the country in Pangasinan, committing outrages and abuses, impelled by erroneous beliefs due to their illiteracy, but not necessarily acting by previous agreement. Furthermore, the record does not show that the crime was preceded by reflective meditation upon the murder in question. Circumstances which qualify criminal responsibility, whatever their nature and effect, can in no case rest upon mere presumption, no matter how reasonable or probable, but must be based upon facts which the judicial mind considers to be of unquestionable existence, and which show clearly and indubitably that the criminal calmly and reflectively meditated upon the perpetration of the crime. This is the unvaried rule of the supreme court of Spain. Such facts do not appear from the record in this case. <br/><br/>Nor should it be considered that there were present in the commission of the crime aggravating circumstances Nos. 6, 9, and 14 of article 10 of the Penal Code. the manner in which the accused killed Francisco Gascon does not imply unnecessary cruelty, nor does it show that it was their intention to deliberately augment the evils inherent in the crime or to increase the pain of their victim by the infliction of other unnecessary sufferings, but rather the decided purpose to kill Francisco Gascon. Although the malefactors were numerous and were armed, the existence of the circumstances of abuse of superiority and the assistance of armed men should not be considered as aggravating circumstances, since it does not appear from the record that these circumstances were present as defined in the Penal Code. The fact that the criminals were armed and that they were more than three in number has already been considered. The so-called abuse of authority is involved or inherent in the alevosia, the circumstance by which the crime is qualified, according to the decisions of the supreme court of Spain. <br/><br/>From the foregoing it is to be inferred that the three defendants should be punished by the infliction of the medium degree of the penalty assigned for murder in article 403 of the Penal Code, and should be condemned to the corresponding civil responsibility in solidum, without any subsidiary personal penalty in case of insolvency, in accordance with the provisions of article 51 of the Code, and to the payment of the costs. <br/><br/>Therefore, for the reasons above stated, the undersigned is of the opinion that the judgment appealed should be reversed, and that the defendants Francisco Cabe, Roman Cabe, and Julian Serios should be condemned each one to the penalty of life imprisonment (cadena perpetua), with the accessories of civil interdiction and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during their lifetime, and in case these criminals should be pardoned as to the principal penalty, then to suffer the penalty of absolute, perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during their lifetime, unless these accessory penalties should have been expressly remitted in the pardon of the principal penalty; also, to the payment, pro rata or in solidum, of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of the deceased, and to the payment each of one third part of the costs of both instances, the judge to act in accordance with law if the prosecuting attorney should file a complaint for the frustrated murder or homicide of Daniel Gascon, in case he has not yet done so. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, also dissented. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On September 28, 1901, the plaintiff brought an action of unlawful detainer in the Court of First Instance of Manila. On the same day the judge entered an order directing that the case be tried in accordance with the provisions of article 1571 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force. In the course of the proceedings counsel for the defense offered the testimony of the defendant as a witness on her own behalf. The judge rejected this evidence, ruling that under the Law of Civil Procedure by which the case was being tried the parties themselves could not be witnesses. Judgment was rendered December 20, 1901, in favor of the plaintiff. <br/><br/>On January 4, 1902, the defendant moved for a new trial under the provisions of articles 113 and 145 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions and Special proceedings now in force. By an order of January 13 the judge granted the petition, and against this order the plaintiff appealed. <br/><br/>It has been noticed that this case was commenced only two days before the present Code went into effect. As a pending case on October 1 it fell within the class described in article 795, 4 thereof. The court, however, in the proceedings up to and including the judgment applied the provisions of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil. In granting a new trial after the judgment he applied the Code now in force. <br/><br/>The important question in this case is this, Do the provisions of articles 113 and 145 apply to all judgments entered after October 1, 1901, or do they apply only to those judgments entered after that date in actions in which the proceedings prior to the judgment were in accordance with the present Code?<br/><br/>We have concluded that they apply to all judgments entered after October 1. <br/><br/>By the provisions of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil a judge of the Court of First Instance after the entry of judgment had no power to set it aside or change it. (Art. 346.) The right to secure a new trial on the ground, for example, of newly discovered evidence did not exist in the law in force prior to October 1, 1901. Neither the Court of First Instance nor the Audiencia nor the Tribunal Supremo, defined in article 1778 et seq., was much more limited in scope than the provision of article 145, 2, of the Code now in force. In short, the latter Code gives remedies which did not exist under the former law. To our minds the question it not whether one procedure shall be followed or another. The question is whether a remedy not given by the former procedure can be added to it. It is not a case of substitution, but of addition. <br/><br/>Let us suppose that the former law allowed no appeal where the judgment was for less than 100 pesos. The present law allows an appeal in all cases. It seems clear that any judgment entered after October 1, 1901, would be appealable regardless of the law under which the case was tried. <br/><br/>Article 795 apparently gives the courts some discretion in the matter of applying one or the other procedure to pending cases. One or the other is to be applied so far as it can conveniently be done. It could not have been intended by the legislative body that the application of article 145 should rest in the discretion of the judge. Whether that shall or shall not be applied can not be a matter of discretion. If it could be conveniently applied in any case it could in all CASEs. We do not think that the question is to be resolved with reference to article 795. Article 145 either is applicable by its own force or it is not. It either applies to all cases pending on October 1, 1901, or it applies to none. It was not left to the discretion of the judge to hold it applicable in one case and not in another. By using the word  \"applicable\" we, of course, do not mean to say that the court would have to grant every motion made under said article. We simply say that he would have to consider every motion and decide each one upon its own merits; in other words, that a party is entitled to the benefit of these articles if he can bring himself within their terms. <br/><br/>The legislative body was of opinion that after judgment a new trial should be granted for newly discovered evidence. That opinion rested upon considerations entirely apart from the particular procedure which had been followed in the case prior to the judgment. The reason why a party who has discovered new evidence should be allowed a new trial have nothing to do with the fact that his case was tried with a jury or that it was tried without one, or that the witnesses were examined in court or that they were examined before a commissioner. <br/><br/>Two case are commenced on September 28 before two different judges. One of them applies the former procedure and orders judgment for the plaintiff. The other applies the present procedure and enters judgment for the plaintiff. Both defendants move for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. That the one whose case was tried in accordance with the present Code is entitled to have his motion heard is conceded. There is no reason why the other should not have the same right. There is nothing in article 145 or in article 113 which expressly limits their operation to judgments in actions commenced after October 1, or to those commenced before that date but tried in accordance with the present Code. These sections grant new remedies not known to the former procedure, and we hold that they apply to all judgments entered after October 1, regardless of the procedure which was applied to the case in its course prior to the judgment. <br/><br/>This conclusion leads necessarily to the dismissal of the appeal. The court below had jurisdiction to entertain this motion and decide it one way or the other. He decided it in favor of the defendant, set aside the judgment, and ordered the case retried. The new trial has not yet been had, and no final judgment has yet been entered. <br/><br/>Such a decision of the court below is not appealable. <br/><br/>Article 123 of the Code in force says:  \"Nor shall any ruling, order, or judgment be subject to appeal to the Supreme Court until final judgment is rendered for one party or the other.\" Article 146 distinctly says that the decision upon a motion of this kind shall not be ground for exception. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated the appeal is dismissed. Neither party will be entitled to costs of this instance. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 8th of August, 1900, D. Canuto Rivera sold to George M. Saul a house and lot at No. 14 Aguilar Street, Iloilo, P. I., by deed recorded in the property register on September 13 of the same year. <br/><br/>On the 29th of the same month Mr. Saul, in an act of conciliation with Mr. Dalton, stated that on the 8th he had bought the said house, and  \"as Mr. Dalton has subleased the house, he demands that the latter deliver to him each month the entire amount of the rental under the sublease,\" to which the defendant replied that as he had a contract of lease with Mr. Canuto Rivera he did not consider himself under any obligation to turn over the entire amount of the monthly rental, but simply the amount which he had agreed to pay Mr. Rivera. <br/><br/>On October 30 of the same year Mr. Saul, invoking article 348 of the Civil Code, according to which the owner of property is entitled to dispose the thing owned by him without other limitation than that established by the laws and articles 2, 23, and 27 of the Mortgage Law, under which a lease, executed by the former owner of the property by means of a public instrument and recorded in the register of property, is a limitation established by law with respect to a third person who acquires by sublease, and affirming that the lease of the property to Dalton by Rivera, because it is a mere private agreement, does not bind Mr. Saul and can not constitute a gravamen upon the property which the purchaser is bound to respect, prayed the court to declare  \"the nullity of the gravamen which Mr. Dalton claims to have on the house purchased and to order him to deliver to Mr. Saul the total amount of the rental received from the date on which the latter purchased the house, with the costs.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>On the 28th of November following counsel for Mr. Dalton answered the complaint, and, for the purpose of determining the issue before alleging the facts constituting his defense, stated:  \"And as the gravamen which my client contends to have upon the property in question is a contract of lease of the same entered into with Mr. Rivera, we conclude that this action is brought for the annulment of this contract of lease.\" Upon this basis he alleged the following facts as relevant to the issues: (1) That it is not true that the contract of lease in favor of Mr. Dalton is a private agreement; (2) that if it was such originally it was subsequently authenticated by the acknowledgment of its authenticity in court by Rivera in an action concerning the validity of the sublease by Dalton before the justice court, in which Dalton had won the suit; that this judgment had been preventively annotated in the property register after Rivera had recorded in a notarial act a description of the property in question. The contract of lease having these conditions, in his third conclusion of the law he draws the inference that  \"It results that this lease is enforceable not only against the person with whom the contract was made but also against a third person, such as is Mr. Saul.\" And in his fourth conclusion of law he states that with respect to Mr. Saul, not only is the contract of lease in question enforceable against him because the same was preventively annotated in the property register, but also because before purchasing the house in question he had knowledge of the existence of the contract, and he who purchases property, knowing the same to be encumbered, is understood to take it subject to the gravamen, and therefore is under obligation to accept the same. <br/><br/>The plaintiff in his replication, presenting the question in the same terms, said:  \"The affirmation of the adverse party that we, in seeking to obtain a declaration of the nullity of the gravamen of the lease which Mr. Dalton claims to have upon the house No. 14 Aguilar Street, are also seeking to obtain the nullity of the contract of lease entered into as alleged between his client, Mr. Dalton, and Mr. Canuto Rivera is wholly erroneous. It is apparent that the adverse party has not perceived that these are two distinct questions and that they can and do exist separately. The gravamen of the lease may be declared void, as prayed for by Mr. Saul, and the contract of lease entered into between Dalton and Rivera still be valid and binding. In no part of our complaint have we discussed the nullity of the contract of lease, because it is our understanding that this is a matter completely distinct from the purpose of our complaint . . . As a final argument the defendant states that the contract was ratified by Mr. Rivera before a notary public and was afterwards preventively annotated and registered, and that therefore it was converted into a public document, and, in consequence, Mr. Saul is obliged to respect it. We do not deny the first paragraph of the replication of the adverse party, but at the same time we contend that the document in question is not a public document, and, with respect to the purchaser, Mr. Saul, is unenforceable . . . This lack of legal efficacy is demonstrated by the dates of the acts which are alleged to make the lease entered into with the former owner binding upon the new owner, and which are as follows: The ratification of the notarial act, September 28; the annotation in the register, October 26, and the date of the purchase, August 8.\" In the fourth paragraph of the replication the plaintiff says:  \"As before stated, we do not discuss the validity or lack of validity of the contract in question, as that is not in issue. If the adverse party had made a careful examination of the complaint he would perhaps have seen that we take for granted the existence of some verbal or written contract in seeking to obtain a declaration of the nullity of the gravamen of lease, a thing which would not be asked if the lease did not exist, as the adverse party might well have understood.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The terms of the only question put in issue by the complaint and answer are well defined. These pleadings present the issue for all legal purposes, and the terms of the question can not subsequently be altered. We can not take into consideration the other question, improperly raised in the replication and rejoiner, with respect to the nullity of the contract of lease itself, upon the ground, apparently, that the stipulation was for the use of the house for such period as the lessee might desire to keep it. Article 531 of the Law of Civil Procedure of 1888 prohibits a variance from the claims advanced and defenses set up in the complaint and answer, which should be the principal object of the suit. Apart from this no discussion can be had upon a matter not involved in the case, and in this case there is no such contract of lease. <br/><br/>There is no question that the position taken by the defendant before the presentation of the complaint and still maintained is that of considering the lease executed by Rivera upon the property purchased by Mr. Saul as an incumbrance, and of insisting upon Mr. Saul’s respecting the contract. Mr. Saul accordingly attempted to free his property from the alleged incumbrance and asked the court to declare the property free from this gravamen in the following words:  \"To declare the nullity of the lease which Mr. Dalton alleges to exist upon the house purchased.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The court must determine whether the plaintiff has the right asserted by him and whether the action brought is the proper one. <br/><br/>The existence of an unrecorded lease, executed in favor of the defendant by the grantor, is taken for granted. There is no allegation that in the contract any agreement has been made that it was to be respected by the purchaser or any other subsequent transferee. <br/><br/>A contract of lease executed by the vendor, unless recorded, ceases to have effect when the property is sold, in the absence of a contrary agreement. The right to use the house is one of the rights inherent in the dominium transferred by the vendor to the vendee. The contract between the lessor and the lessee does not, however, cease to be binding if the term stipulated in the contract has not expired, as the transfer of the dominium and other rights over the thing does not free the vendor from liability under the personal actions arising from a contract of lease. <br/><br/>But these personal actions do not bind the purchaser in his capacity as successor by singular title in the absence of an express agreement between the lessor and the lessee — an express agreement which must, in turn, become a personal obligation of the purchaser. If the lease is recorded it is no longer merely a personal right on the part of the lessee to continue to enjoy the property leased, even after the same is sold. it is also a real right, made such by recordation, and constitutes an incumbrance upon the property, whoever may be its owner or possessor, and is therefore enforceable even against third persons. <br/><br/>The lease in question does not constitute a real right. The subject of the preventive annotation was a judgment which refused  \"to declare the nullity of the contract of sublease entered into between the said Enrique Dalton and the present sublessee of the house belonging to the said Canuto Rivera.\" This is not such a recordation of the lease as to constitute a real right, and which, when inscribed in the register to give it publicity, plainly shows to anyone intending to purchase the property the existence of an incumbrance consisting in the deprivation of the right to use the house during the time stipulated in the recorded lease. <br/><br/>Taking for granted the existence of this sublease, attested in the judgment preventively annotated, it appears that at the date of the complaint it was not the defendant, Dalton, but the sublessee who had actual possession of the property. Article 445 of the Civil Code provides that possession de facto can not be recognized in two distinct persons, except in cases of tenancies in common. The sublessee, therefore, might continue to enjoy this possession with the toleration of the new purchaser, but it would not be a continuation of the civil possession of Canuto Rivera; that is, it could not be considered as a possession in the name of the owner who had conveyed away his civil possession, together with his dominion, by executing the contract of sale. The right of the grantor being extinguished, the right granted is extinguished. Resoluto jure dantis resolvitur jus accipientis. So that at the moment of the transfer of the dominion and civil possession, and, at the same time, of the right to use and enjoy the thing sold, all physical possession in the name of another was extinguished. The civil possession of Canuto Rivera being extinguished the physical possession of the lessee or sublessee was also extinguished ipso jure. In this case the only right remaining to the lessee with respect to the purchaser is that of reaping the fruits of the crop corresponding to the current agricultural year, and, with respect to the vendor, the right to recover from him such damages as the lessee may have suffered. (Art. 1571, par. 2, of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>What, then, was there to prevent the plaintiff from exercising his right to use and to enjoy the thing bought?<br/><br/>The existing lease, argues the defendant — the lease entered into with Canuto Rivera, by constituting an incumbrance upon the property acquired by the plaintiff which the latter is bound to respect. <br/><br/>This lease would be a valid and enforceable incumbrance with respect to Canuto Rivera during its existence, but it is not valid or binding with respect to Mr. Saul, as to whom it has no effect, because of the extinction of the right of the person who granted it, argues in turn the plaintiff. <br/><br/>The right having been extinguished ipso jure it was necessary that this be made known to the lessee, Dalton, or to the person to whom Dalton had subleased the property, the rights of the latter not being terminated by the mere fact of the transfer of the dominion and other real rights. The purchaser, availing himself of his privilege under article 1571, paragraph 1, above cited, to terminate the lease existing at the time of the sale, made use of the act of conciliation, and this act of conciliation was opposed by the objection discussed in this suit; that is, the existence of a real right of recorded lease. <br/><br/>It is unquestionable that for the reasons above stated the alleged incumbrance does not exist as to the purchaser, the plaintiff herein; that is to say, it can not continue to be valid and enforceable against him, as it was against his predecessor, the vendor. Is, however, an action brought to obtain a declaration of the nullity of the alleged incumbrance the appropriate remedy?<br/><br/>It would undoubtedly have been correct to have brought action for an adjudication that the alleged incumbrance was not enforceable. But a prayer that it be declared  \"null\" instead of  \"not enforceable\" is not entirely incorrect, in view of the precise terms of the issue, the allegations of the parties, and the evidence introduced. A judgment which correctly and explicitly passes upon the relief prayed for by the plaintiff would be congruent with the complaint, even if the action may have been improperly designated, inasmuch as this circumstance does not change its nature. (Judgment in cassation of April 4, 1883.) <br/><br/>The possessor in good faith is entitled to the fruits received until his possession is legally interrupted. (Art. 451 of the Civil Code.) The act of conciliation produces a civil interruption provided it is followed by a suit for the recovery of possession. (Art. 1947.) The complaint in this CASE for a declaration that the lease made by the former owner was not enforceable, filed within two months following the date of the act of conciliation by which demand was made upon the defendants for the delivery of the entire rental of the property, is equivalent to a suit for possession. <br/><br/>Therefore the judgment appealed is reversed, and we hold that the lease stipulated in favor of Enrique Dalton by Canuto Rivera upon the house No. 14 Aguilar Street, Iloilo, can not be enforced against George M. Saul, and the said Saul is entitled to recover all rents received or which might have been received by Dalton from the time of the celebration of the act of conciliation, and the said Dalton is hereby ordered to pay and deliver the amount of the said rents derived from the property, without special condemnation as to costs. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, dissents. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case was commenced upon the complaint of the attorney for Antonio Ventura, the husband of Margarita Lopez, in which he accuses Joaquin Santa Marina of having falsified a private document. It is charged that on the 13th of April, 1898, in the liquidation, partition, and adjudication of the estate of the late Juan Grau by the accused, as testamentary executor, he entered the sum of 9,330 pesos and 21 cents as the amount of Mr. Grau’s interest in the  \"La Insular\" factory. This denunciation was not accepted or supported by an information by the prosecuting attorney, even after he admitted that he was a party to the continuation of the investigation directed by the former Supreme Court. <br/><br/>The only authority for the act of the executor, Santa Marina, in entering the sum of 9,330 pesos and 21 cents in the liquidation of the Grau estate as the total amount of the interest of the deceased in the La Insular factory is a balance sheet of the factory. Hence the falsity must have consisted in the balance due as shown therein being some sum other than the amount entered by the executor, Santa Marina, in the general statement of property of the Grau estate. This is the only means by which the truth or falsity of this balance, or the amount of Grau’s share which should have been included in the estate, can be proven. The complainant in the petition presented on the 2d of May, 1901, for the purpose of extending the investigation of the acts denounced, writes on folio 57 a paragraph which commences as follows:  \"In the balance of the 30th of June, 1892, which shows the sum of 9,330 pesos and 21 cents as Mr. Grau’s share, the stock on hand is put in at cost price, whereas the inventory should have been made by including the stock and fixtures on hand at their actual value at that time, for the purpose of determining what Mr. Grau’s interests were on leaving the partnership.\" From the first words written it evidently appears that the amount included by the executor, Santa Marina, in the liquidation of the Grau estate was exactly the same as that which appears in the balance of the Insular factory’s books from which this item was taken. Hence it is evident that the statement made by the executor in the liquidation of the testamentary estate agrees with the balance on the books of the Insular factory. Whether this amount so entered on the books of the factory was or was not the entire interest of the partner Grau, or whether or not the calculation made by Santa Marina, the manager of the Insular factory, was correct, is an entirely different question and one which must be investigated by a different process. In this case the only question which has been discussed is the conduct of the executor in the liquidation of the Grau estate with respect to the statement as to the sum which the executor had received as the value of Mr. Grau’s interest in the Insular factory — whether this interest was or was not ascertained in accordance with commercial custom or in conformity with the law. <br/><br/>Therefore the order of the court below dismissing the proceedings and holding that there is no ground for continuing the prosecution for the falsification charged, with the costs to the complainant, must be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with the costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Cooper, Ladd, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

On the 24th of this month the motion was argued, and was overruled by the court. <br/><br/>These are the antecedents of the action brought by the said captain against the judge and the corporation above mentioned. He seeks to obtain from this court the issue of a writ of prohibition against the Hon. Arthur F. Odlin and against Attorney Oscar Sutro, as representative of the libellants, prohibiting the judge from continuing to take cognizance of the case, the trial of which had been commenced, as he has commenced to do, and from detaining the steamer upon an ex parte libel, and to prohibit Attorney Sutro from continuing to prosecute the suit and seeking the detention of the steamer without actual parties to the proceeding, as required by the provisions of chapter 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and asks that both of them be prohibited from detaining the said steamer unless this be done in accordance with the provisions of chapter 18 of the Code. <br/><br/>The prayer for relief seems to indicate that this court is asked to lay two prohibitions upon the judge of the inferior court, one prohibiting him from taking cognizance of the case, unless he acts in accordance with the provisions of chapter 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the other restraining him from taking cognizance of the case with reference to the detention of the steamer upon an ex parte complaint. <br/><br/>The petition for the first prohibition is based on the allegation that the judge, in overruling petitioner’s motion on the 23rd instant, takes the ground that the word  \"admiralty used in section 4 of article 56 of the Organic Act passed by the United States Philippine Commission ex priore vigore brought to the court all the procedure in use in the maritime courts of the United States; that he sustains his jurisdiction to entertain a libel in rem against a vessel without personality to be sued, and insists upon his jurisdiction to attach the steamer without any of the formalities prescribed by law, and declares his intention to continue to exercise it unless prohibited by this court; and that the petitioner is deprived of the command of the vessel, and the owners thereof of the profits which they might otherwise earn were the vessel free, and that they are furthermore caused damages by reason of the cost of maintaining the vessel, which alone amounts to $200 per diem. <br/><br/>The ground upon which the second prohibition is sought is that the attachment ordered by the court is not such an attachment as is authorized by articles 424 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands, but on the contrary is an attachment under a procedure not in force here, although it is in force in the United States of America in maritime cases, and that the attachment, moreover, was levied without affidavit, bond, or any of the securities established by law whereby the owners of the steamer can obtain reparation for any damages which may be occasioned them by the unlawful detention of the said steamer; and that the procedure of the court below is devoid of all the formal requisites established by law for the levying of such attachments. <br/><br/>Had a case such as this occurred in the time of the Spanish sovereignty, there would have been no difficulty in finding laws applicable to it, for it is certain that in the Philippines we had a complete legislation, both substantive and adjective, under which to bring an action in rem against a vessel for the purpose of enforcing certain liens. The substantive law is found in article 580 of the Code of Commerce. This enumerates in the order of preference ten classes of liens, and a case such as the present would fall under the eight class, which refers to furnishing a vessel with provisions and fuel on her last voyage — one of the liens alleged by the plaintiff corporation in the case which gave rise to this petition for a writ. The procedural law is to be found in article 584 of the same Code, which provides:  \"Vessels subject to the liens mentioned in article 580 may be attached and sold judicially in the manner provided in article 579, in any port in which they may be found, at the instance of any creditor, subject to the exceptions enumerated in the same article.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The reason why provisions of adjective law are to be found in a code which purports to be substantive law is that the old Law of Civil Procedure of the Philippines was promulgated prior to the Code of Commerce now in force in the Philippines, and in this Code of Commerce certain changes were made which were not to be found in the old Code of 1829. At all events, the judge would then have proceeded in accordance with the provisions of article 580 for the purpose of determining the existence of the right, and for procedure would have turned to articles 584 and 579, not overlooking the provisions of articles 1526 and 1527 of the Law of Civil Procedure. These articles refer to attachment proceedings in mercantile matters, the words  \"and fuel\" for the provisioning of the vessel, found in section 8 of article 580 of the Code of Commerce, being regarded an extension of section 4 of article 1526, which designates the charterers or masters of vessels as debtors liable for victuals supplied for their equipment; and the same remark applies to section 4 of article 1527. Hence the judicial procedure for the attachment and sale of a vessel is defined in the articles above-cited of the Code of Commerce and the old Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippines in force under the former Government. By proclamation of the commanding general of the American Army in these Islands, dated August 14, 1898, all these laws were kept in force, and although the old Law of Civil Procedure has been repealed by the new Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the new Government, the Code of Commerce is still operative. The result is, therefore, that in the Philippines any vessel — even though it be a foreign vessel — found in any port of the Archipelago may be attached and sold under the substantive law which defines the right, and the procedural law contained in the same Code by which this right is to be enforced. <br/><br/>There is no necessity for applying any other procedure while that described above is in force, as we understand it to be. The judge did not, therefore, act without jurisdiction when directing the attachment of the vessel in question, and has not exceeded his jurisdiction. If the excess of the jurisdiction upon which the argument was based consists in his having levied the attachment without the fulfillment of the necessary conditions and without following the form prescribed by some law of procedure applicable to the case, it is our opinion that this error is not such an excess of jurisdiction as can be cured by prohibition, and the petitioner has other means whereby this error of procedure may be corrected or remedied. Upon these grounds we decide that the petition for a writ of prohibition must be denied, with the costs to petitioner, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff in bringing this action of unlawful detainer alleged that he was the possessor and owner of the lot which is the subject of the complaint, that the defendant occupies this lot, on which she has constructed a house, as a precarious tenant, and by his tolerance only without the payment of rent, and that demand was made upon her on the 31st of July, 1901, to vacate the lot within the term of thirty days, but that she failed to do so up to the 12th of September following, which is the date on which the complaint was drawn up. <br/><br/>In support of the complaint he presented a notarial act dated the 31st of July, 1901, in which the demand made upon the defendant is recorded, and also a transcript of a possessory information presented in the Court of First Instance of Quiapo on the 11th of June of the same year, approved by order of the same court on the 17th of the said month and recorded in the registry of property of the North District of Manila on the 24th of July following. From this it appears that two witnesses testified that the plaintiff purchased the lot in question from D. Jose Torres y Osorio in the year 1898, and that since that time and up to the date on which the said possessory information was presented he has been in the peaceful and uninterrupted possession of the same. <br/><br/>The defendant denies the facts alleged in the complaint and states that the lot which is the subject of the action belongs in fee to her and her husband, Hilario Rafael, and that therefore they are in possession of the same by virtue of the right of ownership and not as precarious tenants. <br/><br/>The allegations of the defendant tend to show that she purchased the said lot from D. Jose Torres, who is the same person from whom the plaintiff states he purchased it in 1898. For the purpose of supporting this assertion the defendant, among others, presented the following documents:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tA certificate of an act of conciliation effected between herself and Jose Torres, in the justice court of Intramuros, July 27, 1901, in which act the now defendant, Doña Paula de Guzman, stated that some three years before she had agreed with Torres upon the purchase of the lot in question, which was then the property of the said Torres, the consideration being the sum of 270 pesos; that this was paid to him by her, he receipting for the amount stated; and that, having been informed that the said Torres had against sold the same lot to another person, she now made demand upon him to rescind this second sale, in case it had actually consummated, inasmuch as he was without right to sell the lot, it no longer being his. To this Jose Torres replied that his cousin, Candido de Vera, had entered into negotiations concerning the sale of this lot with a woman called Romana Baza; that two or three days after, the woman Romana returned, accompanied by Paula de Guzman, and that all three agreed upon the sale for the sum of 270 pesos, on account of which the women delivered 100 pesos to his said cousin; that subsequently Doña Agueda Asuncion, a cousin of Doña Paula (and the wife of the present plaintiff) delivered to him the remainder — 170 pesos; that subsequently Doña Paula and Doña Romana presented to him and his cousin a document in which the receipt of these sums was acknowledged, which document they signed, and the same was attached to the deed; and that since that time he had made no attempt to sell the lot to any other person, inasmuch as it had ceased to be his property. <br/><br/>(2)\tAnother act of conciliation between Doña Paula de Guzman and Doña Antera Macario, dated the 15th of July, 1901, in which the latter acknowledged that she delivered to the former the sum of 270 pesos, with which the price of the lot purchased from Jose Torres was paid. <br/><br/>(3)\tA copy of an affidavit presented by the defendant on the 9th of August, 1901, to the land-tax office of the city of Manila, in which it is stated that the lot in litigation is her property. <br/><br/>During the probatory period of this case D. Jose Torres and D. Candido de Vera testified that the sale of the said lot was effected as stated in the act of conciliation between the said Torres and Doña Paula de Guzman, and that the sale was made to Doña Agueda Asuncion. It is not necessary for us to express here our opinion as to the legal weight of this testimony because we do not consider it of any importance with respect to this decision. <br/><br/>It is well to state that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has presented any document whatsoever evidencing the contract of sale which they respectively allege was entered into with D. Jose Torres, the former owner of the lot in question, and that the plaintiff admits as true that when he purchased the said lot the defendant’s house was already standing on it. He states that he does not know how long the building has been standing. The defendant alleges that it was built some fifteen years ago. <br/><br/>The possessory title to the lot in question, recorded in the registry of property in the name of the plaintiff, unquestionably gives him the right to bring an action of this character, under the provisions of article 1546 of the Code of Civil Procedure; it is not, however, sufficient to show that one has capacity to sue in order to recover judgment in an action for unlawful detainer. It is necessary for him to further show that the defendant falls within one of the provisions of article 1547 of the said law, because it is only in such cases that the action for unlawful detainer will lie. <br/><br/>The plaintiff has done nothing more than to prove his right of possession as the owner of the lot in litigation. He has not attempted to introduce any evidence tending to show that the defendant is merely a precarious tenant occupying the lot by his tolerance, notwithstanding the fact that she denied this allegation from the beginning and affirms in turn that she is in possession of the lot as owner thereof. The plaintiff has taken the principal issue for granted and has not proved the fact which is the basis of his complaint. <br/><br/>In view of the result of an examination of the record we do not consider it sufficiently proven that the possession of the defendant is merely precarious, especially in view of the fact that she was in possession of the lot when the plaintiff purchased it, as he himself has admitted in the trial. From this it would appear to be a logical conclusion that she did not enter into possession of the lot by mere tolerance of the plaintiff as alleged by him in his complaint. It is possible that the possession of the defendant may have resulted originally from a gratuitous license of the former owner of the property or from a contract of lease entered into with him, but as this point was not in issue at the trial it can not be passed upon in our decision. It is evident that if there was a contract of lease the defendant can not be regarded as a precarious tenant, because this is not the legal character of the possession of lessees. <br/><br/>It not having been clearly proven that the defendant is merely a precarious tenant of the lot in question and of which she claims to be the owner, we are of the opinion that the eviction prayed for by the plaintiff can not be granted. The parties should determine their respective rights in the corresponding declarative action. <br/><br/>The burden is upon the plaintiff to establish all the facts which are necessary to show that he is entitled to recover in an action of unlawful detainer, and in case he fails to do so his action must be dismissed. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain, January 29, 1897.) <br/><br/>The supreme court of Spain has also held, in a judgment dated April 8, 1897, that controverted claims as to property rights can not be passed upon in an action of unlawful detainer, it being the duty of the courts in such cases to do nothing more than to examine and pass upon the propriety of the action brought with respect to the person sought to be evicted. Although the title shown by the plaintiff might be sufficient in another action to show that the defendant is without rights, it can not produce the effect of disturbing the actual situation de facto of the parties. <br/><br/>We therefore reverse the judgment appealed and hold that the eviction prayed for by D. Fidel Rivera must be denied, reserving to the parties the right to determine their respective claims in the proper action, without special imposition of costs herein.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This prosecution is based upon a charge of the theft of a gold chain of the value of 70 pesos. The information alleges that this theft was committed upon an occasion on which the defendant had gone to the house of Doña Cayetana Veloso with the pretext of seeing and selecting a chain for the purpose of buying it. It is supposed that this chain was lost — that is, taken — on one day in June, 1900. A year afterwards, in June, 1901, Florentina Remoquillo stated to Doña Cayetana Veloso that she had seen in the possession of the accused the chain which had been missed a year ago. <br/><br/>A prosecution was commenced, and of the three witnesses called on behalf of the Government — one of them the woman Remoquillo — none were able to testify as to the actual theft nor to the fact that the accused was in the house of the complaining witness to see about burying a chain. At the trial all three, as well as the complaining witness, made self-contradictory statements, their testimony being different from that given at the preliminary investigation. It was found impossible to prove anything when the case was called for trial. The complainant offered to produce other witnesses, and the case was set for a later day. On this occasion five more witnesses were presented. By the testimony of three of them an attempt was made to show that the accused had tried to give an account of her acquisition of the jewelry in question. Two of them directly testified to the theft of which the accused is charged. These two witnesses testified that they had been present a year before and that they had seen the accused commit the theft. Nevertheless, they said nothing about it to the complaining witness until the day before they were put on the stand. the 29th of July, 1901, having been fixed as the day for the continuance of the trial, one witness, Mateo Ufana, stated that on the 28th he had gone to the house of the complaining witness for the purpose of telling her what he knew about the matter, and that on this account she had called him as a witness, together with Mechor del Mar, his companion on that occasion, whom Ufana reminded of what had taken place a year before in order that he might be called as a witness. <br/><br/>The court can not consider that the theft has been proven by the testimony of these two witnesses: it is sufficient to read their testimony and compare it with that of the complainant in order to observe its self-contradictory and partial character. The fact of the theft of which the accused is charged not having been proven, it follows that she was the lawful possessor of the chain in question. The latter was spontaneously exhibited by counsel for the defense to the court in order that it might be shown to the witness. <br/><br/>In accordance with articles 620, 844, and 635 of the Law of Criminal Procedure of Spain promulgated on the 14th of September, 1882, made supplementary law in these Islands by virtue of article 95 of the provisional regulations for the application of the Penal Code and still in force by virtue of the provisions of section 1 of General Orders, No. 58, series of 1900, on the subject of criminal procedure, the person in possession of a thing at the time it is seized by order of the trial court is presumed to be the owner of it. The possession of personal property acquired in good faith is equivalent to title thereto, in accordance with article 464 of the Civil Code now in force, and by the provisions of article 434 good faith is always to be presumed, the burden of proof being upon him who asserts that the possessor holds in bad faith. <br/><br/>What appears to be really questionable is whether the accused is the owner of the chain, in view of the assertions of the complaining witness.  \"Who is the owner? Who is the possessor? This it is impossible to determine a priori. The relation of the person to the thing or the right is apparently the same with respect to ownership as with respect to possession. From an exterior point of view he who exercises acts of ownership must be regarded as the owner. Hence it is that owing to the impossibility of determining the question from appearances and in view of the impossibility of looking into the conscience of the possessor — a matter entirely beyond the scope of judicial investigation — article 434 establishes the presumption of good faith; it does not say that good faith exists, but that it is presumed. This presumption is just, because possession is the outward sign of ownership. It is to be presumed that the right of the possessor is well founded. This appearance of lawful possession must be accepted even though it be in reality nothing more than a disguise for bad faith, because this can not be known with certainty until proved, and because every person is presumed to be honest until the contrary is shown. Hence, protection is given to the possessor against all other persons, whoever they may be, and hence, the precept of article 434 which demands proof of bad faith.\" (Manresa, Commentary on the Spanish Civil Code, Vol. IV, p. 96.) <br/><br/>\"He who may have lost a chattel or has been illegally deprived of it may recover it from the person in whose possession it may be.\" (Art. 464, Civil Code.) <br/><br/>These were the questions in issue. <br/><br/>Therefore the judgment below by which the defendant is convicted of theft and condemned to two months and one day of arresto mayor and to the restoration of the chain in question, which is now in the hands of the clerk, and to the payment of costs, is hereby reversed and set aside, with the costs of both instances de oficio. The chain in question will be returned to the accused, in whose possession it formerly was. So ordered. <br/><br/>Cooper, Mapa, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

By it the defendant, Damaso Jader, was condemned to three months and eleven days of arresto mayor for each one of the said five offenses, together with special disqualification for and suspension from all public offices and from the right of suffrage during the continuation of the penalty, and to the payment of a fine of 12 pesos and the costs. The Attorney-General in this second instance asked that the judgment of the court below be reversed and that the accused be condemned to the penalty of two months and one day of arresto mayor for each one of the five offenses, the penalty not to exceed in its totality three times any one of the individual penalties, to the accessory penalties, to special temporary disqualification, and to the payment to the complaining witnesses of the value of the articles obtained, together with a fine of 15 pesos and the costs. In case of insolvency with respect to the fine or indemnification, it was asked that the defendant be condemned to suffer the subsidiary imprisonment and payment of costs. <br/><br/>The facts found by the court below, which we accept, were that the defendant, Damaso Jader, as cabeza de barangay and teniente of the barrio of the town of Candelaria, accepted cocks, hens, bamboo, and other articles under promise to relieve the persons from whom he had obtained them of the obligation to perform certain duties which they as citizens were required to perform. Notwithstanding the fact that the accused denied these charges and alleges that he had purchased the articles which he received, the record contains evidence which is sufficient to convince the mind of the truth of the facts, which constitute crimes of estafa and not of bribery, as well as the guilt of the accused. Consequently the defendant should be convicted as prayed for by the Attorney-General, article 11 of the Penal Code being taken into consideration in his behalf as a mitigating circumstance. <br/><br/>The facts upon which the prosecutions are based constitute, in our opinion, five offenses of estafa and not of bribery. The articles received by the accused were not offered to him nor were they donated by the five taxpayers of his department for the purpose of corrupting him and in order to induce him to omit the performance of his duty, but were demanded by the defendant, who thereby abused his office as cabeza de barangay and teniente of the barrio. Therefore, instead of applying to these facts articles 383, 385, and 387 of the Penal Code, section 1 of article 534 should be applied, in connection with section 1 of article 535 and article 399 of the same Code. These facts constitute executions committed by a public functionary by an abuse of his official position, to the prejudice and in fraud of his fellow-citizens. Taking into consideration the mitigating circumstance mentioned, therefore, we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed. The five offenses committed constituting estafa, Damaso Jader should be condemned for each one of them to the penalty of two months of arresto mayor, the imprisonment to be suffered by him not to exceed in its total duration three times the length of each individual penalty — that is, six months — the remainder of the imprisonment to be remitted in accordance with rule 2 of article 88 of the Code. The accused should also be condemned to the accessories of article 61, ten years and one day of special temporary disqualification, indemnification to the complainants of the value of the articles received, and in case of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of the costs of both instances.

The trouble was brought on by Fusio, who, approaching Fortin, bit him in the left shoulder. Against this aggression Fortin defended himself, throwing the teniente to the ground, and as a result of the struggle Fusio suffered some slight bruises. <br/><br/>This act would constitute the crime of an attack upon an agent of the authorities and not upon the authorities themselves, inasmuch as Fusio was not an authority, but was only a cabeza de barangay and the teniente of the barrio; but in view of the fact that the commission of this crime has not been proven, the provisions of article 249 and the last paragraph of article 250 of the Penal Code can not be applied. <br/><br/>It appears from the record that the provocation and the aggression were both on the part of the teniente of the barrio, who while drunk bit the accused in the shoulder as stated above, and that the latter in repelling this aggression threw the complaining witness to the ground, the latter being so drunk that he could not represent the authorities with decorum, and that in so doing the defendant only acted in his personal defense against an unlawful attack made without provocation on his part and by means which were entirely reasonable. Therefore, the accused in so acting committed no offense and is exempt from all responsibility, more especially because he simply defended himself against a ridiculous and improper aggression made by a drunken man, who, by reason of his drunkenness and because he was the aggressor, was divested of his character as agent of the authorities. the law can not grant protection to one who has himself been the first to violate it. <br/><br/>By virtue, then, of these considerations we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed and the accused acquitted, the facts not constituting an offense. The accused being free from all liability, the judge below will act in accordance with law with respect to the attachment of the property of the accused. The cost of both instances are adjudged de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, absent on account of illness. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case comes up in consultation of the judgment of the 18th of February, 1898, rendered in case No. 13153 of the Court of First Instance of Batangas, for robbery. In that case Balbino Rosales and Leocadio de Guzman were each convicted as principals in the crime and sentenced to suffer the penalty of one year and one day of correctional imprisonment, with accessories, and Ruperto Alse and Julian Dimaculangan, as accessories, were condemned to the payment of a fine of 6,250 pesetas each, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed six months. All four were condemned to pay to the complaining witness damages in the sum of 55 Mexican pesos, the value of the animals stolen, together with 10 cuartos, the amount of damage done to the corral, this obligation being imposed jointly and severally, in accordance with law, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. These defendants were also condemned to pay each one-ninth part of the costs. The Government in the second instance asks that the judgment be reversed and that the four accused convicted by the judge below be acquitted. <br/><br/>The taking of a bull belonging to Brigido Bonafe from the corral where he was inclosed on the night of Saturday, the 7th of November, 1891, and the destruction of part of the said corral, can not be properly classified as robbery, but constitutes the crime of theft, since, as in order to take the animal away, it was not necessary to destroy the corral or to cut the stakes driven into the ground. the only thing that was done was to pull up some of these stakes for the purpose of making the opening the thieves required, and so the man in charge found the corral the next day. The fence opened does not appear to have been firmly constructed and did not offer the slightest security against the most insignificant effort to force an entrance, as appears from the fact that the thieves, with their hands alone, and without any other instrument, were able to make the opening and to take away the bull. In consideration, moreover, of the fact that the corral was not covered or in any way connected with an inhabited house, it is unquestionable that the offense committed was that of theft, defined and punished by section 3 of article 518 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The guilt of the defendants Balbino Rosales and Leocadio de Guzman as principals, and that of Ruperto Alse and Julian Dimaculangan (who subsequently died) as accessories, is established by the evidence in the case. Therefore, the undersigned being of the opinion that the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the judgment of the court below are correct, with the exception of its conclusion with respect to the classification of the offense, as stated above, the said findings of fact and conclusions of law are accepted by the undersigned as the basis of this decision, notwithstanding the opinion of the counsel for the Government, with the exception of the part of the said judgment which refers to the deceased defendant. <br/><br/>In determining the appropriate penalty the concurrence of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity will be considered. There are no mitigating circumstances in the case, and therefore the judgment of the court below should be reversed. Balbino Rosales and Leocadio de Guzman, guilty as principals of the crime of theft prosecuted, should be convicted and sentenced each to six months and one day of correctional imprisonment, with the accessories of article 58 of the Code. Ruperto Alse should be fined 1,250 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, should suffer subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one month. All three defendants should be condemned to the restitution of the stolen animal, or to indemnify the complaining witness therefor jointly and severally, in the order established in article 125 of the Code, the value of the animal being fixed at 55 pesos, and in case of insolvency should suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment. Finally, they should be condemned to pay each one-ninth of the costs of both instances. The case is, with respect to Julian Dimaculangan, reversed, with one-ninth part of the costs de oficio. No decision can be made with respect to the two absent accused, as to whom the course of the case was suspended, nor with respect to the three defendants acquitted below, under section 50 of General Orders, No. 58.

In accordance with the provisions of article 75 the effect of an appeal so taken is to vacate the judgment of the justice court, and the case, when duly entered in the Court of First Instance, is tried de novo on the merits, in accordance with the regular procedure of that court, as though it had not been tried before and had originally been brought therein. Article 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that upon the rendition of a final judgment by a Court of First Instance disposing of the action either of the parties shall be entitled to perfect a bill of exceptions for a review by the Supreme Court of all rulings, orders, and judgments made in the action to which the party has duly excepted at the time of making such ruling, order, or judgment. No limitation whatever has been fixed with respect to the right of the parties to appeal against a judgment of a Court of First Instance, nor has any distinction been made as to whether the case was commenced in the Court of First Instance or whether it was brought before it by appeal from a justice court. We hold that article 143 confers jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court in all cases of final judgments rendered by the Court of First Instance, either in the exercise of its original jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction. <br/><br/>The motion to dismiss is therefore overruled.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Late on the night of the 28th or early in the morning of the 29th of December, 1897, a wooden trunk, containing clothing and jewelry to the value of 9 pesos and 7 reales, and the sum of 56 pesos and 50 cents in silver, and 5 reales in fractional coin, were taken from the house of Dolores del Rosario, situated in the town of Milaor, of the Province of Camarines Sur. In order to enter the house the thief or thieves had entered by the street door, which they succeeded in opening by thrusting a hand through the nipa wall and then drawing the wooden bolt. By chance the woman Dolores woke up, and, missing the trunk from her room, immediately opened the window toward the street and then saw two men who were running away with the trunk. She recognized one of them as Jacinto Asiao, and as he lived with Atanasio Copendit, she immediately concluded that these two were the men who had stolen her trunk, which was subsequently found some distance away, with the top broken in and the money missing, the clothing and jewelry, however, having been recovered. The damage done the trunk is estimated at 50 cents. <br/><br/>These facts, proven by competent testimony, constitute the crime of robbery without arms, in an inhabited house, of goods and money of which the total value does not exceed 1,250 pesetas, and the breaking of a locked trunk, outside of the place from where it was taken — a crime defined and punished by article 502 and the last paragraph of article 508 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, however, the record does not sufficiently demonstrate the guilt of the two accused, inasmuch as the unsupported allegation of the complaining witness that she recognized Jacinto Asiao on the night of the robbery as one of the men she saw from the window of her house running away with the trunk, is not sufficient to satisfactorily establish the responsibility of Jacinto Asiao, nor is the testimony of a servant of the complaining witness who identified Atanasio Copendit in the ring of prisoners as the other of the two thieves. This same witness testified elsewhere that owing to the darkness of the night of the occurrence he could not recognize the man whom he challenged when running after the two thieves. Therefore, there being no other evidence for the prosecution in the record to support the accusation of the complaining witness in view of the contradictory statements made by the witness referred to, the defendants are entitled to an acquittal. They must be presumed to be innocent until their guilt is proven by satisfactory testimony, and even in case there is a reasonable doubt as to their innocence they are entitled to an acquittal. Therefore, in accordance with section 57 of General Orders, No. 58, the judgment of the court below must be reversed and the defendants acquitted with the costs of both instances de oficio. <br/><br/>The order declaratory of insolvency is approved, and the judge is directed to act in accordance with law with respect to the property of Copendit, which was attached.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The final judgment in this case having been pronounced on the 31st day of March last, the complaining witness, on the 5th day of April, gave notice of appeal. The appeal was allowed. Counsel for the accused now moves the court to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was taken on the sixteenth day after the promulgation of the sentence, fifteen days being the term assigned by article 47 of the law. <br/><br/>The question arising is whether the fifteen days are to be counted from the very day of the publication of the judgment. <br/><br/>In a doubtful case the law will be interpreted in the light of its underlying principles. The law in question is based upon the American legislation, and the local legislation in force prior to its promulgation, which, by section 1 thereof, is declared to be continued in force in so far as not in conflict with its provisions. <br/><br/>Under the American system, in computing time the first day is excluded and the last day included, it not being necessary to cite authority in support of this proposition, inasmuch as the same doctrine has been established in the special legislation of the Philippines, as may be seen in articles 4 and 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure now in force. No rule was more uniform in the law as formerly and as still enforced in these Islands, as may be seen in the Codes of Criminal and Civil Procedure, as well as in the Code of Commerce and the Civil Code. Article 1130 of the Civil Code establishes as a principle that  \"when the term of an obligation is fixed by days to be counted from a specified one, such day shall be excluded from the computation, which shall begin in the following day.\" It not being demonstrated that article 47 of General Orders No. 58, upon the subject of criminal procedure has intentionally departed from these precedents, it must be construed harmoniously with the other law, both substantive and adjective, which is wholly uniform on this subject. The reason why the first day is excluded is undoubtedly because the appellant is given fifteen days in which to appeal, and as Paragraph 1, article 7 of the Civil Code provides that a day shall always be understood to consist of twenty-four hours, it follows that the period allowed would not be fifteen complete days were the day in question - that is, the day of the publication of the judgment — to be included in the computation. <br/><br/>The motion is therefore overruled, with costs.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 27th of January, 1896, the solicitor representing Gregorio Francisco and Antonia Rojas, husband and wife, filed a written complaint alleging that on the morning of the 16th of the said month Juan San Luis, Lorenzo Trinidad, Hermogenes Ignacio, and Fabian Francisco proceeded to cut some canes which were growing on a piece of land situated at a place called Carapdapan, of the town of Marilao, of the Province of Bulacan, of the exclusive ownership of the said complainants, and conveyed the same, with other canes already cut, and which were lying on the ground there, to a lot next to the house of Fruto Andrade, who at that time was there present, together with Melecio Rojas, this having been done by the four persons mentioned by order of Andrade, who subsequently made use of the canes taken; that as Maximo de los Santos, the person left in charge of the land and of the plantation by the owners, opposed this proceeding, Melecio Rojas threatened him that, as he, Rojas, was justice of the peace, he could have him tied up and sent to the capital city; and that, in view of this proceeding, Maximo left the place to report what had happened to the owners of the land. <br/><br/>Maximo de los Santos, the caretaker referred to, and seven other witnesses testified in corroboration of the facts related in the complaint. For the purpose of proving the ownership of the land the complaining witness exhibited the certificate of the registrar of property to the effect that a possessory information, prepared at the instance of Antonia Rojas, had been presented at his office for record, and in this possessory information the land on which the canes were cut is described. They also presented a will executed by Esteban Rojas, in clause 18 of which, as part of the share of Doña Antonia, the land referred to appears. The value of the canes cut was estimated by experts to be 18 pesos. <br/><br/>The defendants Lorenzo Trinidad, Juan San Luis, Hermogenes Ignacio, Fabian Francisco, and Fruto Andrade confessed that the four first-named defendants had cut a number of canes on the day mentioned in the complaint, and took them, together with others formerly cut, to Andrade’s house by order of the latter. There was some conflict in their testimony as to the name of the place where the cane was cut, although Andrade testified that the place was called Donganpare or Carapdapan. All of them, however, denied that they or Melecio Rojas, who had gone there for the purpose of getting two pieces of bamboo, had made any threats against Maximo de los Santos, who, they said, was not there. This is also the testimony of Rojas, who, in turn, cited four witnesses who testified in corroboration of his statement to the effect that they had not seen Maximo de los Santos, the man alleged to have been threatened, in the place referred to. <br/><br/>Fruto Andrade further testified that he is the owner of the land where the cane was cut, and that the land does not belong to Antonia Rojas, but to him (Andrade), he having inherited the same from his late father, Saturnino Andrade, who had been in uninterrupted possession thereof for thirty years. As witnesses he called five persons who were owners of adjacent lands. The first three of these witnesses testified in corroboration of the statement of Andrade, the fourth affirmed that her deceased husband had so informed her, and the last witness testified to the contrary. <br/><br/>It also appears from the case that an ocular inspection of the land in dispute was made in the presence of the parties in interest, the owners of adjacent lands, and of eleven other witnesses presented by Andrade, the result of which was that the lines of the land inspected and on which the canes were cut were found to be different from those of the land which the private prosecutors claim to be their property. The witnesses there present testified that the land in question and the bamboo canes were the property of Andrade. The record furthermore contains a copy of a complaint filed by Andrade against the private prosecutors, for the purpose of obtaining the annulment of the possessory information presented by them to the registrar of property. <br/><br/>From the facts above stated it appears that the record does not contain conclusive evidence of the existence of the crimes of theft and threat. On the one hand, it does not appear that Maximo de los Santos was present at the place where these threats are alleged to have been made, nor that Melecio Rojas, charged therewith, had made such threats; and, on the other hand, it does not appear from the record that the other defendants have stolen bamboo as charged, with intent to profit thereby, inasmuch as the evidence does not sufficiently demonstrate that the bamboo or the land on which it was growing was the property of Antonia Rojas. Consequently, the question of the ownership of the land having been put in issue, and that question being now pending decision in the action for the annulment of the possessory information with respect to the land in question, brought by Andrade against the private prosecutor, Antonia Rojas, it does not appear that Andrade and his codefendants have committed the crime of theft. <br/><br/>To overcome the allegations and evidence of the complainants, Fruto Andrade, in turn, introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that he was the owner of the land and of the canes alleged to have been stolen, and as the boundary lines of the land which the complaining witness alleges to be her property are different from those of the land claimed by Andrade, as shown by the ocular inspection conducted in the presence of the parties, of the owners of adjacent lands, and of several other witnesses, the defendants must be acquitted on account of the absence of proof of the existence of the crime of theft as above stated, and because the fact of the cutting and taking of bamboo from the land in question by order of Fruto Andrade does not constitute the crime of theft, and because the question raised by the parties as to the ownership and possession of the land in question must be determined in the proper civil action. <br/><br/>Therefore, for the reasons stated, and in view of the provisions of section 57 of General Orders, No. 58, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed with costs de oficio, the judge to proceed in accordance with law with respect to the property belonging to some of the defendants which has been attached. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

Unagan was sentenced to one year eight months and twenty-one days of prision correccional, and Gregorio Lat, Valentin Dimaano, Mariano Tagle, and Pelagio Unagan to two months and one day of arresto mayor, with accessories and costs, the case having been dismissed with respect to Andres Cariaga, alias Pernis, he having died. Counsel for the Government, however, asked that the judgment below be reversed, and that Francisco Resaba be convicted of the offense of resistance to the agents of the authorities and sentenced to one month and one day of arresto mayor, with a fine of 325 pesetas, and to the payment of a seventh part of the costs, one-half of the time of the preventive imprisonment to be computed, and also asks that the other defendants be acquitted, with the exception of the deceased Cariaga, they being exempt from criminal responsibility by reason of their having acted in the performance of an official duty, this offense being established by section 11, article 8 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The undersigned concurs in the opinion of the representative of the Government and accepts his opinion with respect to the findings of fact and the classification of the offense prosecuted. <br/><br/>In effect, the defendant Francisco Resaba, while armed and in company with the malefactor Cariaga, committed the crime of resistance to the agents of the authorities, because the officers when attempting to arrest these men were compelled to use force; and although it may be true that the record does not show that Resaba made an attack on the officers with a weapon, it is nevertheless unquestionable that he did resist them by refusing to obey and surrender to his captors, while Cariaga openly attacked them, and it was on this account that their captors wounded them. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that the acts of the officers constituted the crimes of the discharge of a firearm and of lesiones graves and menos graves, inflicted upon the persons of Cariaga and Resaba, nevertheless they are exempt from all responsibility, because they were acting in the performance of an official duty, inasmuch as it appears that the judge of the corresponding military court and given orders for the capture of Cariaga and Resaba, they having been prosecuted on a criminal charge. Consequently, the officers must be acquitted in accordance with the provisions of article 51 of the provisional law for the application of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>For the reasons expressed, therefore, and in view of article 252 of the Penal Code and section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, the judgment of the court below must be reversed and Francisco Resaba convicted and sentenced to one month and one day of arresto mayor, with a fine of 325 pesetas, or to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with accessories, and to the payment of one-seventh part of the costs in both instances, one-half of the time of the preventive imprisonment suffered to be computed, the defendants Pablo Unagan, Valentin Dimaano, Gregorio Lat, Mariano Tagle, and Pelagio Unagan to be acquitted, with the remainder of the costs de oficio.

Lucio Barbasa, for each one of the two offenses of falsification of certificates, was convicted and condemned to two years and one day of suspension and a fine of 325 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, Teodoro Luna, for each one of the two crimes, to the penalty of one month and one day of arresto mayor, with accessories, and each to the payment of one-sixth part of the costs, one-half of the provisional imprisonment suffered to be deducted from the term of imprisonment to which they were sentenced. Tomas Acosta and Ignacio Jacobo were acquitted of the charge of falsification of cedula and falsification of certificates, and the said Acosta and Jacobo and the said Lucio Barbasa and Teodoro Luna were acquitted of the charge of falsification of a certificate of baptism by reason of lack of evidence of their participation in the said crime, with the remainder of the costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Julio Lagrimas del Rosario made certain arrangements with one Catalino Gaza by which the latter was to act as his substitute in the military service under the Spanish Government. Gaza received from Lagrimas a certain sum of money through the agency of Tomas Acosta, a sergeant of the engineer corps which the substitute was to join. Acosta undertook to prepare the necessary documents, consisting of the certificate of baptism of Julio Lagrimas, the cedula of the latter, and two certificates issued by Lucio Barbasa as gobernadorcillo of Ermita, with two attesting witnesses, Miguel Abalos and Teodoro Luna. The result of the investigation shows that the certificate of baptism was altered by erasing the year of birth and by writing over this erasure  \"1864\" in place of  \"1874,\" which was the year originally entered on the certificate; that the personal cedula of Julio Lagrimas, issued on July 4, 1894, by the said gobernadorcillo, Lucio Barbasa, and the cabeza de barangay, Miguel Abalos, stated that Lagrimas was 30 years of age and was a resident of Ermita, the fact being that he was only 20 years of age and was a resident of Santa Cruz; that in the certificate of July 10, 1894, by the said Barbasa, and the attesting witnesses, Abalos and Luna, it was stated that Lagrimas, whose name was registered in the district under the charge of Abalos, was free from forced military service for that year, the fact being that he was included in the list of conscripts of the district of Santa Cruz; and that in another certificate of the same date, issued by the same gobernadorcillo and witnesses, it was recited that Eleuterio Lagrimas, the father of the substitute Julio, had given his consent to the enlistment of the latter, the certificate purporting to bear the signature of Eleuterio, who, in fact, was unable to write, and who denies having given such consent. <br/><br/>From the facts related it follows that the crime of falsification of a public document has been committed, inasmuch as a certificate of baptism is of a public or official character, this crime being defined and punished in article 301, in connection with article 300 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The facts also show the commission of another crime, consisting in the falsification of a personal cedula, punished by article 307 of the same Code, as well as the commission of two crimes of falsification of certificates, defined and punished by article 310 of the Code. <br/><br/>Tomas Acosta, the only person liable for the falsification of the certificate of baptism of Julio Lagrimas, being absent, it is not necessary for the court to deal with the question of his guilt in the commission of this crime. <br/><br/>For the same reason, owing to the absence of Miguel Abalos, the cabeza de barangay who issued the false personal cedula in favor of the said Julio Lagrimas, making it appear falsely that the latter was registered in his office, the question of his guilt is not before us. Nor can we hold that the gobernadorcillo of Ermita, Lucio Barbasa, participated in this falsification of cedula, inasmuch as his signature was simply appended for the purpose of attesting that the cedula was issued, as it was in fact, by the cabeza de barangay, upon whom alone rests the responsibility for the validity and the authenticity of the cedula issued. <br/><br/>With respect to the two crimes of falsification of certificates, and in view of the absence of Miguel Abalos, one of the attesting witnesses who signed them, the only persons who can now be held responsible for their participation in the commission of the crime are the gobernadorcillo, Lucio Barbasa, and the other attesting witness, Teodoro Luna, as, notwithstanding the exculpative allegations of the gobernadorcillo, Barbasa, the fact is that he, acting in his capacity as a local authority, together with the attesting witnesses, issued and signed these certificates, under his name and official title. Hence, the attesting witness Teodoro Luna and the gobernadorcillo who signed the certificates are responsible for the falsification committed by the mere fact of having certified to the truth of statements therein contained, it being unquestionable that Barbasa performed these acts in the exercise of his official duties, the documents having been sealed with the seal of the municipal court of Ermita, and consequently having, under the administrative laws, an official character, the offense being specifically punished by article 310 of the Code. However, the responsibility of Teodoro Luna, as a mere attesting witness, and therefore a mere private individual, and not in the exercise of any public, permanent office, falls within the provisions of article 311 of the Code. <br/><br/>It the commission of the two crimes above mentioned, we are of the opinion that the especial circumstance of article 11 of the Code should be applied, in view of the character of the crimes prosecuted and the personal conditions of the accused, there being no aggravating circumstance to offset the effect of this article. Therefore, by virtue of section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, and without passing upon those parts of the judgment of the court below against which no appeal has been taken, we are of the opinion that for each one of the two crimes of falsification of certificates the former gobernadorcillo of Ermita, Lucio Barbasa, should be sentenced to two years and one day of suspension from public office, the right of suffrage, the exercise of any trade or profession, and to a fine of 700 pesetas, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of one-sixth part of the costs in both instances, and Teodoro Luna to one month and fifteen days of arresto mayor, with the accessories of another sixth part of the costs in both instances; and that the said Barbasa and Luna be acquitted of the charge of falsification of cedula, with two-sixths parts of the costs de oficio, the judgment below to be affirmed in so far as it is in conformity with this opinion and reversed in so far as it is in conflict therewith. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur for the crime of allanamiento de morada. Judgment was rendered on February 6, 1902, condemning the defendant to six years of presidio correccional and a fine of 3,250 pesetas. His appeal against this judgment was admitted on February 12. On May 8 he filed in this court a motion in which he asked for a new trial (1) on the ground of newly discovered evidence and (2) for errors of law committed at the trial below. The Solicitor-General has filed an escrito in which he consents that the motion may be granted. The motion was argued on the 19th of July. <br/><br/>The question presented called for a construction of article 42 of General Orders, No. 58. That article is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"At any time before the final entry of a judgment for conviction, the defendant may move, either in the court in which the trial was had or on appeal to a higher court, for a reopening of the case upon the ground of newly discovered evidence material to his defense. The motion must be made to the court which pronounced sentence, or to the appellate court if the case shall have been appealed, and must be made in writing and be supported by the affidavits of the witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given, or by duly authenticated copies of documents which it is proposed to introduce in evidence. Within a like period after conviction, a case may be re-opened on account of errors of law committed at the trial. The motion must be in writing and must set forth the errors alleged to have been committed. In courts of higher jurisdiction the decision of the court on such motions shall be in writing, and, together with the motion and affidavit, shall be attached to the papers in the case, and any evidence admitted must be taken and recorded as upon the original hearing. The new hearing, if allowed, shall take place in the court of original jurisdiction.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>So far as this article relates to a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence it is not difficult of construction. The right to move for a new trial on this ground both in the lower court and in this court is clearly given. Nor can there be doubt as to the time within which this motion may be heard. The language is  \"at any time before the final entry of a judgment for conviction.\" In the time of the Spanish sovereignty and down to the promulgation of General Orders, No. 58, there was no final judgment in any criminal case until this court or rather its predecessors had so ordered. If the case was not brought up by appeal it was sent up for review and no one was finally acquitted or convicted of a public offense until his case had been passed upon here. This is the settled doctrine of this court. (United States v. Perez, April 9, 1902; United States v. Kepner, February 6, 1902; and of its immediate predecessor, United States v. Gascon, January 30, 1901.) <br/><br/>By article 50 of General Orders, No. 58, it was provided that cases in which the penalty did not exceed one year’s confinement or a fine of 250 pesos should not be sent up for review, and by Act No. 194 of the Commission that no cases should be sent up for review except those in which the punishment ordered was death. There still remained in all these cases the right of appeal within fifteen days after the rendition of the judgment. The effect of these provisions was to make final and conclusive after fifteen days all those judgments of the Courts of First Instance not declaring the death penalty from which no appeal had been taken. <br/><br/>It is said that the article gives the defendant the right to present his petition for a new trial on the first ground, namely, newly discovered evidence, at any time within the fifteen days, and does not require it to be decided within that time. <br/><br/>The first clause of the article says that the defendant may move for a  \"reopening\" of the case. This indicates that the case is not reopened when the defendant makes his motion, but when it is granted. It follows that when later on in the article it is stated that the case may be  \"reopened\" within a like period, the meaning is that the motion must be heard and decided within that period. Although the phraseology is not the same in both clauses, we do not think that the legislative power intended to provide that a motion on one ground should be decided within the time to appeal, while if made on the other ground it would be sufficient to merely present it within that time. No reason is apparent why any distinction of this kind should be made between the two cases. <br/><br/>It may be stated, we think, as a general rule that any action which the trial court takes in a case must be taken before the time to appeal from the final judgment expires. When such time has once expired it ought to be certain that the rights of the parties, so far as the trial court is concerned, are definitely fixed. <br/><br/>If the mere presentation of the motion within the time is sufficient, this might be done on the last day and the case thus kept in the hands of the trial court for an indefinite time. The defendant in the meantime either would have to be committed, the court hearing and deciding the motion afterwards, or the execution of the sentence would have to be stayed until such hearing and decision could be had. This by reason of the press of business or for other causes might occasion a delay of some considerable time. If the latter course were pursued it is probable that the trial court would be called upon to hear such a motion in almost every case, for the mere presentation thereof would secure a stay of execution. <br/><br/>For these reasons we hold that a motion to reopen the case on either ground must be heard and decided before the time to appeal from the judgment expires. The Court of First Instance may grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence at any time after the trial and before judgment, and also until the expiration of the fifteen days allowed for an appeal. <br/><br/>Article 42 contains also the following provision:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Within a like period after conviction, a case may be reopened on account of errors of law committed at the trial.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Must such a motion be made in the trial court or can it be made also in the appellate court? In support of the former view it may be said that a motion for a new trial in an appellate court for errors committed in a trial court is unusual, if not unknown, and that for the correction of such errors the defendant already had a remedy by appeal, in which they all can be reviewed. But, on the other hand, the law distinctly gives a defendant the right to have such a motion considered  \"within a like period after conviction.\" As we have seen, that period does not terminate in appealed cases until judgment is rendered in this court. The law therefore gives him a right to move in this court. The words  \"after conviction\" indicate that the time in which he may make this class of motion does not commence until after the judgment is rendered in the lower court. <br/><br/>Our conclusion is (1) that within the fifteen days allowed for an appeal the trial court may reopen the case on either of the two grounds; (2) that if the defendant does not appeal he can make no motion in this court on either ground; (3) that if he does appeal he can move in this court on either ground. If the defendant makes the motion in the lower court and that is denied, he can still appeal if the fifteen days allowed therefor have not expired. if the defendant fails to appeal and limits himself to a motion in the trial court to reopen the case, this motion fails if it is not decided within the said nonextendible period of fifteen days. If he presents such a motion and before it has been decided he appeals within the said fifteen days from the judgment which has been rendered in the case, it will be considered that he has waived his right to have his motion determined by the trial court. The case having been remitted to this court the appeal will be proceeded with, without prejudice, however, to the right of the defendant to move here for a reopening of the case before the final judgment is rendered. <br/><br/>When a motion is made on either or both grounds in this court, the motion will be heard at the same time that the appeal is heard. In this respect we conform the practice to that marked out for civil cases by article 497, No. 2, of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. <br/><br/>The result of the foregoing conclusions applied to the case at bar is that the hearing already had on the motion is vacated, and the motion is set down to be heard with the appeal on the 22d day of August, 1902. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The judgment in this case condemning the defendant to six months of arresto mayor and a fine of 6,250 pesetas was rendered on the 20th of November, 1901. The time to appeal from it expired on the 5th day of December. The appeal was not taken until the 9th of December. It must, therefore, be dismissed. <br/><br/>The case can not be affected by the facts connected with the defendant’s attempt to have the case reopened. He first moved for this relief on the 21st of November. This motion was denied on the 26th of November without prejudice to the right of the defendant to renew it. It was renewed on December 2 and was undecided on the 5th day of December, when the time to appeal expired. The motion was determined on the 9th, and on the same day the appeal was taken from the judgment. The case of United States v. Flemister, just decided, lays down the rules which govern proceedings under article 42 of General Orders, No. 58. It is there held that such a motion must be heard and decided before the time to appeal from the judgment expires, and that the pendency of such a motion does not extend the time to appeal from the judgment. <br/><br/>There can be no doubt but that the judgment in this case was the resolution of the court entered on November 20, and not the order of December 9, denying the motion to reopen the case. General Orders, No. 58, was ingrafted unto the then existing Spanish proceedings as is expressly stated in the preamble. Under that procedure it was well understood that the judgment was that document which, after reciting the facts proved, the claims of the attorneys, and the conclusions of law, pronounced the punishment which the defendant must suffer. The words  \"final judgment\" in General Orders, No. 58, refer to this determination. This is made clear by the provisions of articles 44 and 47, which provide for an appeal from a final judgment or from an order made after judgment. Both distinguish between a final judgment and an order, such as the one of December 9, made after final judgment. In this case the appeal is plainly stated to be from the judgment, and it was too late. Even if it had been from the order, it would not avail the defendant; that order, having been made after the judgment below became firme, was void. (United States v. Flemister, supra.) To have it so declared would not help the defendant. <br/><br/>The appeal is dismissed with costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan against the defendant, Manuel Garcia, on an information for murder. The case having been brought here on appeal, counsel for the defendant has moved the court for an order declaring that the offense prosecuted falls within the provisions of the proclamation of amnesty promulgated July 4 last, by the Civil Governor in the name of the President of the United States. <br/><br/>The information charges two serious offenses alleged to have been committed on May 11, 1898, by the said Garcia, formerly president or municipal captain of the town of Manaoag, Pangasinan. <br/><br/>The town having been attacked by a large number of insurgents early on the morning of the day mentioned, the local police and a number of volunteers commanded by the municipal captain, Manuel Garcia, succeeded in repelling the attack. They pursued the attacking party and captured two of them, who were immediately tried by a summary court-martial, presided over by the municipal captain, and the two men were at once executed in the town square. <br/><br/>The accused alleges that this proceeding was strictly in accordance with instructions given him and other local presidents by the then civil governor of Pangasinan, who governed that province on behalf of the Spanish government, and that he therefore acted as a Spanish official and in the exercise of the powers and duties of a municipal captain. <br/><br/>Supposing that the killing of these two men constituted the crime of double murder, perpetrated by a Spanish official invested with authority, during the period of Spanish sovereignty in these Islands, can the defendant, Manuel Garcia, in view of the capacity in which he acted when ordering the commission of these crimes, be considered to be entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation? The reply, in our opinion, must be negative, both under the spirit and the letter of the proclamation. <br/><br/>The conditions required for the application of amnesty are complex. It is necessary for the delinquent to be a person who, in the Philippine Archipelago, has committed one or more of the crimes enumerated in the proclamation. The defendant who now seeks the benefit of the amnesty, although he is a Filipino and the crimes charged against him were intimately connected with the political movement, nevertheless, as he does not pertain to the class of persons to whom the amnesty expressly refers, it is legally impossible, without disregarding the generous purpose of the Chief Executive, to hold him entitled to its benefits. <br/><br/>It is true that this is a matter in which a broad and favorable interpretation should be followed; but it is also true that it is never lawful to extend the purpose of the sovereign to cases and persons not included within the scope and terms of the benefit conceded. <br/><br/>Without prejudging the question of the guilt of the appellant, Garcia, it must not be forgotten that the accused, when the acts which have led up to this prosecution were committed, was in the exercise of a public office of local authority in the town of Manaoag, in the name and representation of the Spanish Government, and therefore he was an official of Spain, and was not a rebel or revolutionist against the authority of the Spanish Government. <br/><br/>If the defendant has committed such crimes in violation of law, and by the abuse of his official position under the former Government, the mere reading of the amnesty proclamation is sufficient to show that such an offender is not entitled to its benefits. <br/><br/>This act of policy which the Chief Executive saw fit to adopt after a long and radical disturbance of the Filipino people, thus throwing the veil of pardon and forgetfulness over certain crimes committed on account of or on the occasion of the revolution, for the purpose of tempering or mitigating the rigor of the law in accordance with the dictates of common sense and human conscience, can under no circumstances be regarded as referring to public officials of the Spanish Government, event though they may have been natives of the Philippines. <br/><br/>Those who, under the former Government, abusing a public office, have committed crimes punishable under the Code, can not therefore be included in the amnesty, inasmuch as it does not appear from the text of the document that it was the express will of the President to include such crimes of Spanish officials within its scope, and the courts of justice would certainly exceed their authority were they to give the amnesty decree a greater scope than that which it should properly be given. <br/><br/>Furthermore, even in case Manuel Garcia should be entitled to such pardon, it is incumbent upon him to solicit this favor from the Chief Executive, who alone can grant him a special pardon now, the general amnesty in question not being applicable. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated the motion of the attorney of Manuel Garcia is overruled, with the costs against him. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was tried for asesinato in the court below and acquitted. The case is now pending in this court on appeal. The Solicitor-General and counsel for the defendant have united in a petition that he be declared to be embraced within the President’s amnesty proclamation of July 4, last. The circumstances under which the deceased met with his death and the defendant’s connection therewith are stated in the judgment of the court below as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The accused, Anastasio Carmona, was a captain in the so-called insurrectionary army. Acting in this capacity he issued an order to four soldiers under his command to lie in wait for the deceased, a tailor named Marcelo Blas, at a place known as Maytubig, in the district of Malate, in the city of Manila, and to arrest him as a spy in the service of the Americans and the police. In pursuance of this order these soldiers lay in wait for Blas at the place designated, and as he passed by, accompanied by his wife and one Domingo Tansio, on the afternoon of the 3d of October, 1900, and after a short conversation, in which they told him that their superior officer wanted to have his measure taken for a suit of clothes, Blas refusing to go because it was too late, two of the men threw themselves upon him and stabbed him to death, leaving his body in the middle of the road.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>These findings of the court below are supported by the evidence in the record. An examination of the record also shows that there was some uncontradicted evidence to the effect that an order had been issued by an insurrectionary officer superior in command to the defendant, directing the arrest of all Filipino spies, and we think the conclusion is entirely warranted by the evidence that the defendant was acting in pursuance of this order in commanding the arrest of the deceased. <br/><br/>The defendant having participated in the insurrection against the Government of the United States, comes within the description in the proclamation of the classes of persons to whom the amnesty is extended. The crime of which he is guilty — if he is guilty of any crime of which he can be convicted upon the complaint in this case — belongs also to one of the classes of offense covered by the proclamation. It was committed in the course of the insurrection against the Government of the United States; it was committed pursuant to orders issued by insurrectionary military authorities, and it was committed for military purposes in the interest of the insurrection, and without any motive of private revenge or hatred whatever, so far as is disclosed by the record, and falls, therefore, within the designation of  \"offenses political in their character,\" as that expression is used in the proclamation, even placing upon the words the narrowest interpretation of which they are in any possible view susceptible. <br/><br/>The defendant is therefore declared to be entitled to the benefit of the proclamation upon filing in this court the oath prescribed therein as a condition of the amnesty, and upon the filing of such oath the cause will be returned to the court below with directions that the defendant be discharged with costs de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a prosecution for bigamy. It is admitted that the defendant, Felipe Isla, was married to Aleja Pascual on November 14, 1901, in the parish church of Tondo in this capital. On 5th of November, 1899, in the parish church of Santa Cruz, this capital, Felipe Isla was married to Maria Hilario, the complaining witness. The defendant claims that he is not the Felipe Isla who was a party to the marriage of 1899. The evidence to show that he was is the following: He admits that he knows Maria Hilario and that she was living with him as his mistress in 1899. She testifies that the defendant is the person whom she married. Also so testify the two witnesses to that marriage who are named in the record thereof, namely, Maximo Briseno and Alejandra de los Angeles. The defendant is a native of Parañaque. So was the Felipe Isla of that marriage. Passing the statements of the defendant’s witnesses that they understood that he was a bachelor prior to his marriage in 1901 as not entitled to any weight in face of the direct evidence to the contrary, the only other ground on which the defendant rests his denial is the fact that the record of the first marriage shows that the Felipe Isla there mentioned was the son of Valentin Isla and Maria Madayag, both deceased, while the defendant testifies that he is the son of Gabriel Isla and Petra de Leon. <br/><br/>If the only evidence of the first marriage had been this certificate, it is undoubtedly true that it would not have been sufficient to show that the Felipe Isla therein named is the defendant. But other evidence was received which proved that fact. This evidence shows that the statement in that record as to the parentage of the defendant was incorrect. The record, however, was still competent evidence to prove the marriage of a Felipe Isla, the other evidence pointing out who that Felipe Isla is. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the defendant that he should have been convicted under article 440 of the Penal Code and not under article 471. The history of the former article is given by Viada in the Commentaries on the Penal Code (vol. 3, p. 128) as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The object of the disposition of this article (455) introduced by the revisors of 1870, was to restrain the public scandal which would result from the fact of a person uniting himself in canonical matrimony after the promulgation of the Civil Marriage Law, abandoning his consort, and contracting a new marriage according to the beforementioned civil law, with another person, without the canonical having been legitimately annulled, or vice versa; both cases equally possible without resorting to intrigue and deceit from the moment that article 2 of the before-mentioned law of June 18, 1870, did not recognize civil effects with respect to the persons and property of the husband and wife of their descendant, except in the case of civil marriage or that celebrated according to the provisions of the before-mentioned law; and furthermore, the ecclesiastical power could very well ignore the legitimacy and validity of said civil partnerships, in which case the latter would not be an obstacle to a legal celebration of the canonical marriage between persons distinct from those who were only bound by a civil tie. <br/><br/>\"But from the time that article 1 of the royal decree of February 9, 1875, conceded all the civil effects recognized by the laws of Spain until the promulgation of the 18th of June, 1870, to canonical marriages, celebrated or to be celebrated, in accordance with the sacred canons, the existence of the crime mentioned, prescribed, and punished in this article 455 is not possible, since every new marriage, either civil or canonical, celebrated without being legitimately relieved of the previous obligation, will constitute an offense against the civil status of the persons, and therefore the crime of bigamy, prescribed and punished by article 486.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The law of 1870 relating to civil marriages never was promulgated and was never in force in these Islands. The provisions of the Civil Code relating to civil marriages and a civil registry were in force here for two weeks after the promulgation of the Civil Code, and then were suspended by royal order. It can therefore be said that civil marriages were never recognized here until the promulgation on the 11th day of December, 1899, by the Military Government of the United States, of General Orders, No. 68. <br/><br/>Why article 440 was retained in the Penal Code when it was placed in force here is not apparent. It is enough to say that in this case both marriages were canonical and indissoluble and that the defendant falls exactly within the terms of article 471. This court has applied said article to a case where the second marriage was celebrated in accordance with the provisions of said General Orders No. 68. (The United States v. Leoncio Cruz, December 13, 1901.) <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated the judgment of the court below is confirmed with costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Between 1 and 2 o’clock in the afternoon on the 29th of April, 1900, Mauricio Rubeta went to the house of Jose Marcos, a resident of the colony of San Antonio of that district, and went up the stairs of the kitchen looking for the owner of the house. Salome Valderas, a little girl 10 years of age, who was in the kitchen, told him that Marcos was sleeping in his bedroom. The accused immediately went into the room and, approaching the sleeping man, inflicted upon him two wounds in the breast, from which he died in a few moments. The little girl, seeing that Rubeta was attacking her master, left the house and told Gervasio Fernandez what had occurred. Fernandez, with Justo Balais, went to the house of Marcos, where they found his dead body, showing two wounds inflicted by a sharp instrument, stretched on the ground near the stairway. The little girl Valderas stated that she believed the motive of the aggression was that Marcos had objected to one of his servants marrying a son of his slayer. <br/><br/>The facts stated constitute the crime of murder, defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the violent death of Marcos was the consequence of the mortal wounds which were inflicted upon him while he was in bed and asleep and from which he died in a few moments. This circumstance constitutes alevosia, because the aggressor, availing himself of the condition in which he found his victim, evidently employed means for the commission of the crime which directly and specially tended to insure its consummation without any risk to himself resulting from an attempt on the part of the injured party to defend himself, for, as the latter was asleep, it is unquestionable that Rubeta acted with the assurance of success in the realization of his criminal purpose. <br/><br/>The record demonstrates conclusively the guilt of the accused as author, by direct participation, of the crime prosecuted. The exculpative allegation of the defendant that he was attacked by the deceased is not admissible, because not supported by the evidence, and because the witness for the prosecution, whom he called to prove this allegation, denied it absolutely. Furthermore, the drops of blood which were found by the two witnesses who went to the house shortly after the commission of the crime, together with other signs observed on the bed on which Jose Marcos was attacked, confirm unquestionably the testimony of the girl Salome Valderas, the only eyewitness to the aggression. The fact that the body of the deceased was found in another part of the house does not show that the accused was struck before the attack, as it is quite natural and by no means extraordinary that Marcos, aroused by the wounds received, should have gotten out of bed and attempted to walk until he fell dead. <br/><br/>In addition to the qualifying circumstance of alevosia, which carries with it an increase of punishment and makes the crime committed that of murder, we must also consider the concurrence of the twentieth aggravating circumstance of article 10 of the Code, because Marcos was attacked and mortally wounded in his own house, without provocation on his part. This circumstance, however, is compensated in its effects by article 11 of the Code as a mitigating circumstance to be applied, in view of the personal conditions of the defendant and the nature of the crime. Therefore the accused will be punished by the medium grade of the penalty assigned in article 403 of the Penal Code, and by virtue of articles 13, 17, 27, 81, and 122 of the Penal Code, rule 51 of the provisional law, section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, and Act No. 194 of August 10, 1901, we are of opinion that the judgment appealed should be affirmed in so far as by it Mauricio Rubeta is condemned to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) and to the costs of the prosecution; the defendant to be also condemned to suffer the accessories designated in rules 2 and 3 of article 54 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 1,000 Mexican pesos, and to pay the costs of this instance.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The petition sets forth, in substance, that at the trial of the main action in the court below certain material evidence offered by the petitioner was excluded; that he excepted to the exclusion thereof and duly tendered a bill of exceptions to the judge; that the judge refused to sign such bill of exceptions or to restate the facts and exceptions embraced therein, but directed the opposing counsel to prepare a bill; and that without notice to the petitioner the judge signed and certified the bill so prepared, which was thereupon transmitted to this court as the bill of exceptions of the petitioner. The prayer of the petition is that the printing of this bill of exceptions be suspended and that a mandamus issue to the judge directing him to transmit to this court the entire record, together with the bill tendered by the petitioner, and for such relief as may be deemed equitable. <br/><br/>Construing the petition liberally, as we are bound to do (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 2), we think it is evident that the object is to obtain relief against the action of the judge in refusing to sign the petitioner’s bill of exceptions, under the provisions of section 499 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This section provides that where  \"from any cause the bill of exceptions,\" a mandamus may issue from this court upon petition  \"requiring him forthwith to make return of his reasons for not certifying the bill of exceptions and for a hearing upon the judge’s return, at which other testimony than the return may, in the discretion of the court, be received  \"in determining the validity of the reasons given by the judge for his failure or refusal to sign the bill of exceptions.\" If the reasons given in the return are insufficient or no return is made, an absolute mandamus is to issue commanding the judge to sign and certify  \"the bill of exceptions as set forth in the petition or as modified by the Supreme Court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We think the remedy provided in this section applies not only to cases where the judge has declined to take action on the bill of exceptions tendered by the party or has refused to certify such bill without substituting another in its place, but also to cases where he has certified a bill of exceptions but has refused to embody therein some or all of the exceptions embraced in the bill tendered him, and which the party claims to have been properly taken. The language of the Code does not expressly limit the remedy to cases where no bill of exceptions has been signed, but on the contrary it is to be available whenever  \"from any cause the bill of exceptions is not certified . . . without fault of the party tendering the bill of exceptions,\" the implication clearly being that it may be invoked whenever the specific bill of exceptions tendered by the party is improperly disallowed, either as a whole or in any material part. <br/><br/>Some inconvenience may result from permitting parties to establish the truth of exceptions in this court, but a like procedure prevails under statutes more or less similar to the provisions in question in several of the United States (3 Enc. of Pl. and Pr., 493), and the framers of the Code may well have considered that it was necessary or expedient to grant such relief to parties who should claim that they had been deprived of their right to bring their cases to this court for decision by erroneous or arbitrary and unauthorized action on the part of the trial judge. <br/><br/>It is difficult to see why any distinction should be made between a case in which no bill of exceptions whatever has been certified and one in which the bill of exceptions certified does not conform to the truth of the facts. A trial judge may as effectually destroy a party’s right to have an adverse judgment reviewed in the appellate court by refusing to embody in the bill of exceptions as signed a single exception of vital importance to the party’s case, as by refusing to sign any bill of exceptions whatever. <br/><br/>The petition is denied as respects the suspension of the printing of the bill of exceptions transmitted to this court, the printing being already so nearly completed as to render such suspension impracticable. Upon the filing by the petitioner of a copy of the bill of exceptions presented to the judge a mandamus will issue to the latter directing him forthwith to make return of his reasons for not certifying the same. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>This is an application to this court for a writ of mandamus against W.F. Norris, judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros, to compel him to certify a bill of exceptions prepared by petitioner and presented to the said judge for approval in the case of D. Jose V. L. Gonzaga v. Doña Carmen F. de Cañete. It is alleged in the petition that on the 15th day of May, 1902, a judgment was rendered by the Court of First Instance against the petitioner in said suit; that petitioner, through his attorney, within the time prescribed by law, prepared and presented a bill of exceptions for appeal which the judge of the Court of First Instance refused to approve and sign, and required him to amend the same; that another bill of exceptions was presented which was examined by the judge and also disapproved; that the judge thereupon directed the opposite party to prepare and present a bill of exceptions in the case; that this bill of exceptions was approved, signed, and ordered filed in the case without notice to petitioner, and that the case has been appealed to this court on this bill of exceptions, the contents of which are to him unknown. He attaches a copy of the bill of exceptions prepared by him to his petition and asks that the judge below be compelled by writ of mandamus to send up the judgment of the court below with his bill of exceptions; that the printing of the bill of exceptions signed and approved by the judge of the Court of First Instance, and certified to this court, be suspended, and that a mandamus issue to the judge directing him to transmit to this court the entire record together with the bill tendered by the petitioner. <br/><br/>Our statute regulating the perfecting of bills of exceptions provides that  \"the excepting party shall cause to be presented to the judge a brief statement of the facts of the case sufficient to show the bearing of the rulings, orders, or judgments excepted to, and a specific statement of each ruling, order, or judgment that has been excepted to, for allowance by the judge. The judge shall thereupon, after reasonable notice to both parties and within five days from the presentation of the bill of exceptions to him, restate the facts if need be, and the exceptions, so that the questions of law therein involved, and their relevancy shall all be made clear, and when the bill of exceptions has been perfected and allowed by the judge, he shall certify that it has been so allowed, and the same shall be filed and thereupon be transferred to the Supreme Court for determination of the questions of law involved.\" (Sec. 143, Code of Civil Procedure, 1901.) <br/><br/>While by statute a bill of exceptions drafted and tendered on behalf of the party appealing should be taken by the trial judge as a basis of the authenticated bill, still, where the bill is found by the judge in his opinion not correct, the trial judge must decide as to the proper contents of the bill, and state the facts, if need be, and proceed to settle and sign it accordingly. (Sec. 143, Code of Civil Procedure, 1901.) <br/><br/>Where the statements of the bill as settled are deficient or false, a restatement should be asked before the transcript has been transferred to the appellate court; because the record of the trial court remains within the power of the trial court, while the record on appeal lies within the power of the appellate tribunal. (Elliott, Appellate Procedure, 205.) <br/><br/>It is admitted by the petitioner that a bill of exceptions was prepared in the case and has been filed in the court below and certified to this court on the appeal. An examination of the bill of exceptions shows a strict compliance with the provision of this section. A bill of exceptions signed, filed, and made part of the record as the law requires, imports absolute verity. (Elliott on Appellate Procedure, sec. 811.) The bill of exceptions filed in the case and certified to this court being in strict compliance with the law must, under this principle, import absolute verity, unless the provisions of section No. 499 of the Code of Civil Procedure (1901) are applicable to the case. <br/><br/>In the opinion of the majority of the court the petition is construed to have for its object relief against the action of the judge in declining to sign the petitioner’s bill of exceptions. Regarding it as such, does the petitioner bring himself within the provisions of section 499? The section in question reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"SEC. 499. Judge failing to sign exceptions, how compelled. — If from any cause a bill of exceptions is not certified by the judge of the court below, without fault of the party tendering the bill of exceptions such party, or his attorney, may apply at the next term of the Supreme Court, and on petition obtain from said court a mandamus directed to such judge. (1) Such petition must set out substantially the bill of exceptions tendered, and shall be verified by oath by the lawyer as to the truth of the bill of exceptions as tendered by the party or his lawyer and as to the other facts stated therein. (2) Upon the filing of such petition, the Supreme Court shall issue a mandamus directed to the judge of the Court of First Instance, requiring him forthwith to make return of his reasons for not certifying the bill of exceptions, and the judge shall forthwith make such return, and the Supreme Court shall hear the original parties and determine the validity of the reasons given by the judge for his failure or refusal. (30 If the reasons be insufficient, or the judge fails or refuses to make any return to the mandamus, the Supreme Court shall issue a mandamus absolute, commanding the judge to sign and certify the bill of exceptions, as set forth in the petition, or as modified by the Supreme Court. (4) If he still refuses to do so, the cause shall be heard by the Supreme Court on the exceptions as verified in the petition for mandamus. (5) In the hearing upon the judge’s return, as provided in subdivision 2 of this section, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, receive other testimony than the judge’s return, in determining the validity of the reasons given by the judge for his failure or refusal to sign the bill of exceptions.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The duty of settling a bill of exceptions is judicial. Mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to settle and sign a bill of exceptions, but it would be a violation of principle to specially direct him what to put in the bill in a case where there is a controversy as to what the bill should contain. (Elliott on Appellate Proceedings, secs. 516, 798, 810.) A bill of exceptions must be settled by the trial judge, and by him only. The appellate court is not authorized to act except by statute. (Enc. Pl. and Pr., vol. 3, p. 442.) <br/><br/>In the State of California, one of the States referred to in the decision of the court as having a statute resembling our statute, and in which a similar practice is supposed to prevail, it has been held that the statute of that State applies only in cases where upon the settlement of a bill of exceptions or statements of facts, the judge refuses to allow an exception, but where the judge merely refuses to settle a bill as presented, a mandamus is the proper remedy. (Tibbets v. Riverside Banking Co., 97 Cal., 258; Landers v. Landers, 82 Cal., 480; Saig v. Saig, 49 Cal., 263.) <br/><br/>The proceedings under these statutes is not against the judge to compel him to sign a bill of exceptions, where from any cause a bill of exceptions has not been certified to, but is a proceeding before the appellate court to establish by proof some exception which has been disallowed by the trial judge. On the contrary, the proceeding under our statute is where from any cause the bill of exceptions is not certified by the judge of the court below to compel him by mandamus to make return of his reasons for not certifying the bill of exceptions. It is said in the decision that the remedy provided by this section of the statute applies not only to cases where the judge has omitted to take any action upon the bill of exceptions tendered by the party, or has declined to certify such bill without substituting another in its place, but also to those where he has certified the bill of exceptions, but has refused to embody therein some or all of the exceptions or facts contained in the bill tendered him, and which the party claims to have been properly taken. In other words, that it is within the scope of the remedy to disprove before this court a bill of exceptions duly authenticated and filed in the case by the judge below, and which has been certified to this court on appeal. <br/><br/>The fact that a trial judge may as effectually destroy a litigant’s right to have an adverse judgment reviewed in the appellate court by refusing to embody in the bill of exceptions as signed an exception vital to the party’s cause, as by refusing to sign any bill of exceptions whatever, is a matter which addresses itself to the legislative discretion, and a statute or provision not intended for this purpose should not be used to effect such results. The law as expressed in this opinion is in accordance with the law upon the subject prevailing in a large number of the States of America. In fact it seems to be the established doctrine of all the American courts except those in which this practice has been changed by statute. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated I am unable to concur in the opinion of the majority of the court. </div>'\n",

As soon as he obtained this deed it was recorded in the office of the Registrar of Property, and then, at his instance, the Court of First Instance directed that he be put in possession of the said lands. However, in view of the opposition made by Flaviano Abreu to the possession which Reyes sought to obtain, the proceeding was declared contentious by a subsequent order of the court dated the 16th of June, 1894. <br/><br/>The record shows that on the 16th of June, 1893, the judge of First Instance of Bulacan, with his assistants, a surveyor and a representative of Flaviano Abreu and his wife, went to the places called Nagdasic and Panducot, and that the said representative was put in possession of certain lands in each one of the two places mentioned, of which lands the boundaries and superficial area were separately recited in the minutes of those proceedings. <br/><br/>With these antecedents, counsel for the complaining witness accused Lino Reyes of having committed the crimes of estafa and falsification, alleging that he, pretending to be the owner of the land situated at the place called Panducot, of the town of Calumpit, of the value of more than 5,000 pesos, and by means of a proceeding in voluntary jurisdiction, obtained from the Court of First Instance the possession of said land on the 16th of June, 1894, to the prejudice of the Abreus, who had been in possession thereof since June 16, 1893, and that he, to that end, made use of fraud and deceit, and that upon the true facts being known to the court, and in view of the opposition of the possessors, the Abreus, by order of the 16th of June, 1894, above mentioned, the proceedings were declared contentious, and that consequently the said Reyes was liable to suffer the penalties prescribed by article 537 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>It was further alleged that the crime of falsification was committed because said Lino Reyes made a false statement of facts in his petition prepared for the purpose of obtaining a title from the State to the said lands, and by deceit obtained a title deed to the same, and that subsequently, by means of this title deed, he obtained judicial possession of the said lands, and that consequently he was subject to the penalties prescribed by articles 301 and 302, in connection with article 300 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The case having come on for trial, the defendant in his testimony alleged that by composition with the State he had obtained a title deed to a piece of land situated at a place called Mayto; that he had solicited this composition in May, 1893, and that, by virtue of the deed issued, he was judicially given possession of the said lands, and further stated that, before seeking to obtain the said title, he was already in possession of the land as guardian of his children, who had inherited the same in 1890 from their deceased grandmother, Regina Estrella. <br/><br/>From the facts related it does not appear that the crimes of estafa and falsification charged have been committed. <br/><br/>The mere fact that the defendant, Reyes, solicited composition with the State concerning certain lands which he alleges to have been in possession for more than twenty years under title derived by inheritance, and the fact that he obtained a deed to the said lands, there having been no opposition on the part of any third person with a better right, after compliance with the other legal requirements, are not those which constitute the crime defined and punished by article 537 of the Code, because there was no deceit employed, lucri causa, to the prejudice of a third party. Nor has Reyes, under a simulated claim of ownership, sold, leased, or encumbered the said lands, and thereby violated the articles of the Penal Code cited. <br/><br/>Apart from the fact that it does not appear with sufficient clearness whether the Mayto lands are or are not the same lands situated at Panducot and Nagdasig, as this fact does not appear to have been determined in the proceeding of ocular inspection (folio 167); and in view of the fact that the complaining witness, Flaviano Abreu, opposed the judicial possession which the defendant, Reyes, sought to obtain of the land situated at Mayto, it is evident that the real question at issue is the validity or nullity of the deed obtained by Reyes, and the real question in controversy is the ownership of certain lands, which, furthermore, do not appear to have been sufficiently identified. <br/><br/>With respect to the falsification also charged in this case, it does not appear from the record that the defendant when he affirmed in writing that he had been in possession of the Mayto lands for twenty years in representation of his minor children, who inherited the same from their grandmother, Regina Estrella, maliciously perverted the truth with the wrongful intention of injuring the complaining witness; and with respect to the deed given the accused by the Government, the same is an official document which, on its face, complies with all the requisites established by the administrative laws and is guaranteed by the State. Its validity and legal efficacy are unquestionable. <br/><br/>The charges of estafa and falsification made in this case are deficient in that they take the issue itself for granted. The evidence does not disclose any false statement of fact nor the simulation of any title. <br/><br/>Upon these considerations, therefore, and because the facts charged do not constitute the crimes of estafa and falsification, there being no indication that such crimes have been committed, we are of opinion that the judgment of acquittal of the court below should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance de oficio, and that the judge should dissolve the attachment levied upon the property of the defendant, Lino Reyes.

The defendant, Vicente Villamor, a Filipino and resident of the Islands, was at that time his secretary. On that day the soldiers of Guillermo Ballesta pursuant to his orders seized the person of Bernardo Dumasal and conveyed him to a house in the said pueblo. He was there tried by a council of war presided over by said Guillermo Ballesta as jefe principal and composed of the said Ballesta and the jefes parciales of that vicinity. The defendant acted as secretary of this council. Dumasal was by the council convicted and sentenced to death, and we will assume that the proof shows that the sentence was executed. <br/><br/>The judgment of the council was in writing. The defendant signed it, as secretary, and gave a copy of it to the officers charged with its execution. He had, according to the testimony, neither voice nor vote in the council. Dumasal was tried for the crime of having bought cows for the Americans and was convicted of being a traitor to his country. The trial and conviction were had pursuant to laws and regulations promulgated by officials of the insurrectionary forces superior in rank to the defendant. <br/><br/>The case being here on review and upon appeal by the defendant from a sentence of death, he moved for his discharge on the ground that he was included in the proclamation of amnesty of July 4, 1902. The Solicitor-General joined in the motion. We think that it should be granted. <br/><br/>The defendant was and is an inhabitant of the Philippine Islands. At the time the act complained of was committed he was participating against the United States in the insurrection then existing. The execution of Dumasal was  \"an offense of a political character.\" (In re Castioni, R. (1891), 1 Q.B., 149; in re Ezeta, 62 Fed., 964; United States v. Carmona, decided by this court August 19, 1902.) <br/><br/>The evidence shows that it was committed pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities superior in rank to the defendant. <br/><br/>So that, assuming that the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him, a question which we do not decide, it also shows that he has been pardoned. <br/><br/>The defendant is therefore declared to be entitled to the benefit of the proclamation, upon filing in this court the oath prescribed therein as a condition of the amnesty, and upon the filing of such oath the cause will be returned to the court below with direction that the defendant be discharged, with costs de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">One day in the month of July, 1900, Carlos Velasco, having heard that Juan Custodio and a lad called Pedro, whose surname is unknown, both of them residents of the town of Cainta, were bandits and engaged in assaulting and robbing travelers, he proceeded to arrest them. By order of the revolutionary general, Francisco de los Santos, to whom he reported upon the case, he turned the prisoners over to Gavino Ramos, with directions to kill them. This order was carried out by Gavino Ramos in the presence of Carlos Velasco, by striking the deceased with an iron crowbar. The bodies of the two deceased were then buried in a hole dug by the accused. Cirilo Vergara, who was plowing a field a short distance from the place where these crimes were committed, was an eyewitness to the crimes, and he it was who pointed out the graves to Mateo Custodio, a brother of one of the deceased, who, accompanied by the police, was looking for the missing man. In a hut close by the place of burial were found two belts and two hats which had belonged to the deceased, a Remington rifle with forty cartridges, and two carabaos belonging to the defendant Velasco. It appears from an investigation of the record that these goods and animals were turned over to the municipal president of Cainta. <br/><br/>The facts related constitute two crimes of murder, because the violent killing of Juan Custodio and the lad Pedro is homicide, qualified by the specific circumstance of alevosia, which, under article 403, makes the penalty applicable heavier than that prescribed by article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the deceased were bound, unarmed, and unable to defend themselves, or even to avoid by flight the criminal aggression of their heartless slayer, who, in killing them, acted without risk to himself in the perpetration of these horrible crimes, in the commission of which means were used which completely assured their consummation. <br/><br/>Velasco is guilty because he induced or ordered Ramos to kill the deceased, and Ramos is guilty because he it was who actually committed the crime as described in articles 12 and 13 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>It does not appear from the record that Velasco, when ordering Ramos to kill the two men whom he had arrested, was acting in obedience to orders from General Francisco de los Santos, and even if he had so acted, he would not thereby be relieved from responsibility, nor would Gavino Ramos, the person who actually committed the crimes. The allegation of the latter that Velasco it was who killed the lad Pedro can not be believed, because of the lack of evidence and because the statement is denied by Velasco, who affirms that it was Ramos who killed both the deceased by his order, which statement is corroborated by the testimony of Cirilo Vergara, the only eyewitness, whose testimony is of the greatest importance in this case and is worthy of full credit. Thanks to this witness, the full details of the crimes were ascertained, and the record contains nothing which tends to offset or destroy the truthful statement by this witness of the fate of the unfortunate victims. <br/><br/>Upon the merits of the case, and more especially upon the testimony of Velasco himself, it is evident that with respect to him in the commission of the double crime of murder, the aggravating circumstance of premeditation must be considered, by reason of the fact that he it was who arrested the deceased and subsequently ordered his codefendant to kill them in his presence, later assisting in the burial of the bodies. These acts demonstrate conclusively that Velasco deliberately formed the criminal intention of killing the two men he had arrested, without any legal reason or authority therefor, in order to effect their death by means of his codefendant. It follows, therefore, that he unquestionably acted after thinking over and meditating upon the perpetration of these grave crimes. <br/><br/>With respect to Ramos, the actual guilty agent in the commission of these murders, the circumstance of premeditation can not be considered, as Ramos simply committed the crimes in obedience to the orders from Velasco. The record does not disclose evidence showing that he took part in the arrest or detention of the deceased, or that he acted after reflection and meditation upon the perpetration of these crimes. The facts which constitute circumstances that either increase or mitigate criminal responsibility must be proven in order that such circumstances may be taken into consideration, and consequently, as the record does not contain evidence showing whether the place of the killing was or was not inhabited, or what was the age of the lad Pedro, deceased, there is no basis upon which to rest the application of any other circumstances connected with the facts indicated. <br/><br/>Furthermore, in consideration of the abnormal condition of affairs consequent upon the state of war at that time prevailing in the Province of Rizal, as well as in other provinces of the Archipelago, and the moral and material disturbance prevailing at the time when these crimes were committed, and which had practically broken down all authority, in consequence of the revolution started several years ago, the respect for the law was with difficulty maintained outside of the towns held by military garrisons, and consequently the writer is of the opinion that the circumstance established in article 11 of the Code should be applied to mitigate the penalty, in view of the character of the crimes committed and the personal condition of the defendants. Consequently, the aggravating circumstance of premeditation, the only one existing against Velasco, is offset, and, with respect to Ramos, no aggravating circumstance having been appreciated, it is evident that Velasco must suffer the medium grade of the penalty assigned by article 403 of the Penal Code, and Ramos the minimum degree of the same penalty for each one of the two crimes of murder, article 87 and the last two paragraphs of article 88 of the Penal Code, however, to be applied. Therefore, by virtue of General Orders, No. 58, April 23, 1900, the act of August 10, 1901, of the Civil Commission, and rule 51 of the provisional law for the application of the Penal Code, the judgment of the court below should be reversed and Carlos Velasco condemned to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) for each one of the crimes of murder, it being understood, nevertheless, that in computing the duration of each one of the two penalties indicated thirty years will be allowed for each one, and to the accessory of civil interdiction, and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the lifetime of the convict; and in case the principal penalty should be remitted by pardon, then absolute, perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for life shall be imposed, unless this accessory penalty shall be expressly remitted in the pardon of the principal penalty. Gavino Ramos is condemned for each one of the two crimes of murder to the penalty of twenty years cadena temporal and the accessories of civil interdiction during the duration of the penalty, to absolute disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the lifetime of the convict, and to the payment, jointly and severally with his codefendant, Carlos Velasco, of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of each one of the deceased, and of one-half each of the costs of both instances, the court to act in accordance with law with respect to the two carabaos belonging to the defendant Velasco, delivered to the municipal president of Cainta.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 27th of December, 1901, Maria Esperanza Evangelista, a young woman 21 years of age, left her parents’ house without their knowledge and went to the house of the defendant in the same pueblo, where she remained in his company ten days. The defendant was married, but it would appear that he lived apart from his wife. He had represented himself to Maria to be a widower, and had agreed to marry her. The intimacy between them had existed for some months prior to the elopement. Maria testifies that she went to the defendant’s house in pursuance of an arrangement had with him, and this evidence, taken in connection with the natural inference which arises from the facts which we have stated — all of them established independently of her testimony — affords ample warrant for the finding of the court below to the effect that she was induced to leave her home by the persuasions of the defendant. Nor can it be doubted, in view of the deceit practiced by the defendant and in the entire absence of any evidence upon which any other explanation of his conduct in receiving her in his house can be based, that his purpose was an immoral one. It is not, however, shown that he actually assisted her in any way in making her escape from her home, further than to receive and conceal her in his house. <br/><br/>Upon these facts, the defendant was convicted under article 446 of the Penal Code, which punishes  \"the abduction of a virgin under 23 and over 12 years of age, effected with her consent.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It is claimed that the conviction is wrong (1) because the young woman was not taken physically from her parents’ home, either by the defendant or through his agency, and (2) because the fact of her virginity at the time of the alleged rapto was not established. <br/><br/>(1)\tThe etymology of the word  \"rapto\" would indicate that the offense involves a physical taking of the person, but in the case of a rapto with the consent of the woman, where ex hypothesi the woman is not taken away from her home by force, but abandons it of her own accord, enticed by the wiles and persuasions of the raptor, it is apparent that the word is not used in its original and proper signification, but is employed in the sense of seduction. <br/><br/>\"There are two kinds of rapto — rapto by force, punished by article 445 of the Penal Code, and rapto by seduction; the first is that which is effected by violence, against the will of the person abducted, and the second is that which is accomplished without the resistance of the person, when she consents to it through promises, enticements, or artifices of her raptor.\" (4 Escriche, Dictionary of Legislation and Jurisprudence, 793; article Rapto.) <br/><br/>In the latter case, if the woman leaves her home in the company of the raptor, or if he provides means whereby she may effect her escape, and so, in a sense, takes her from her house, these circumstances are merely incidents in the commission of the offense, and do not pertain to its essence. <br/><br/>The essence of the offense is not the wrong done to the woman, but  \"the outrage to the family and the alarm produced in it by the disappearance of one of its members.\" (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of November 30, 1875.) It has accordingly been held by the same court, in a case where the facts were not distinguishable from those now before us, that all the essential elements of the offense were present, the court stating the law to be that  \"it is not necessary . . . that the virgin . . . should have been taken physically from her parents’ house, but it is sufficient that she has abandoned it, and that, yielding to the allurements and promises of the seducer, she has withdrawn herself for a time from the power and vigilance of her parents.\" (Judgment of October 29, 1895.) <br/><br/>To the same effect is the judgment of March 31, 1896. We are satisfied, both upon principle and authority, that a forcible taking of the woman is not an element of the offense described in the article under which the defendant was convicted. <br/><br/>(2)\tUnder the Spanish system of proof, the mere fact that a woman was unmarried did not give rise to a presumption de jure of her virginity; nor would this fact, without any other evidence tending to show her good repute, be a sufficient basis for a presumption of fact. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of July 4, 1896. See also judgment of June 30, 1891.) <br/><br/>Under the system of proof established by the new Code of Civil Procedure, a presumption de jure of the woman’s virginity would arise whenever it was shown that she was unmarried, and would continue until overthrown by proof to the contrary. (Section 334, 1.) <br/><br/>The provision cited establishes, we think, a rule for both civil and criminal cases, and might be applied to the present case. It is not, however, necessary to decide that this is so, because we think that there is sufficient evidence in the case to warrant the inference of the young woman’s virginity, without the aid of any artificial legal presumption. Slight evidence is sufficient of a fact of this character, when there is no absolute proof to the contrary. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of June 30, 1891.) Here it is shown, not only that the young woman was unmarried, but that she lived at home with her parents, a mode of life not commonly or naturally associated with dissolute habits. This, we think, was sufficient. <br/><br/>The court below did not find the existence of any aggravating or extenuating circumstances, and we do not discover any. The penalty should, therefore, be applied in its medium degree, and the court erred in applying it in its minimum degree. We are also of opinion that the sum in which the defendant is required to endow the young woman is too large, having regard to the circumstances of the parties and the social and economic conditions of the country. <br/><br/>The defendant should be sentenced to one year eight months and twenty-one days of prision correccional; to endow the young woman in the sum of 500 pesos, Mexican, with costs. With these modifications the judgment is affirmed, and the case will be remanded for execution of the judgment as modified. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Torres and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The defendant went to the ball without any invitation from the owner, danced with an American doctor, and then went away. He returned after a short time. What then occurred is thus described by Don Teodoro:  \"I met him almost in the door of the stairway, took him by the hand, and said to him, ’Friend, what do you wish; do you come to dance?’ Without making any answer he roughly withdrew his hand and struck me.  \"Q. — Did you not ask him to take a seat? A. — I did so, but he answered nothing and immediately entered.\" Don Teodoro also testifies that he had heard that the defendant had some design of attacking Captain Davison, who was in the sala, and that he stopped him because he was attempting to enter that apartment. The testimony of Ramos is to the effect that the owner of the house attempted to stop the defendant as he was entering the sala. <br/><br/>The defendant admits that he struck Don Teodoro so that he fell, and that he had a quarrel with Captain Davison, in which he, the defendant, drew his revolver. <br/><br/>It seems clear to us that the purpose of the owner of the house was to prohibit the defendant not from entering his house but from entering the sala in order to avoid a quarrel between the two Americans. His taking the defendant by the hand, asking him if he came to dance, and requesting him to be seated, are inconsistent with the idea that he was attempting to keep the defendant from entering the house. His efforts to prevent this meeting were praiseworthy and the conduct of the defendant extremely reprehensible. The latter can not, however, under the evidence be convicted of the offense of allanamiento de morada. <br/><br/>It is unnecessary to consider other questions argued by counsel for the defendant. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and the defendant acquitted, with the costs of both instances de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Ladd, Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

It states that the defendant excepted to the judgment, and that he took no other exception during all the proceedings in the court below. He now moves this court that the bill of exceptions be amended by adding thereto all the evidence taken at the trial. <br/><br/>In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction this court considers three classes of cases, namely, appeals in criminal cases, appeals in special proceedings, and bills of exceptions. <br/><br/>In a prosecution for a public offense it considers upon an appeal all the evidence adduced in the court below, besides both questions of law and fact, and forms its own opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. The practice has not been changed in this respect from that which existed during the Spanish domination. In criminal cases of this character it is necessary that all the evidence be returned to this court. <br/><br/>In appeals in special proceedings, this court has also by the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure now in force the power to pass upon all questions both of law and fact. (Act 498.) <br/><br/>The Code indicates what parts of the evidence are to be returned to this court in the different classes of appeals in special proceedings. (Arts. 779, 781, 782.) <br/><br/>But in ordinary civil actions the power of this court on appeal has been limited and its practice radically changed. It has become for such cases only a court for the correction of errors of law, and no longer, except in the three cases mentioned in article 497, has the power to pass upon questions of fact raised by the testimony. The article says:  \"The Supreme Court shall not review the evidence taken in the court below, nor retry the questions of fact.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Outside of the three excepted cases mentioned in said article 497, our power in cases like the one at bar is limited to a consideration of error of law committed by the court below. And, moreover, we are allowed to consider such errors of law only when they have been duly excepted to. <br/><br/>If no errors of law are committed during the progress of the case or in the judgment, it will not avail the defeated party to bring it here on the ground that the judge should have believed his witnesses rather than those of the other side, unless his case falls within the exceptions mentioned in said article 497. Neither will it avail him to bring the case here, even if errors of law were committed, unless he duly excepted to the erroneous rulings of the court at the time they were made. <br/><br/>In the case at bar it appears that the defendant excepted to the judgment which the court rendered. Upon that exception he is entitled to discuss here the question as to whether or not, assuming that the facts recited in the judgment are true, the plaintiff was entitled as a matter of law to recover the amount of $1,035.40 and interest. He is entitled to argue that the facts stated by the judge do not justify the judgment ordered by him. Upon such an exception he can not argue that the facts are not as stated by the judge. He can not go into the question as to whether upon the evidence the judge should not have found the facts the other way. The case does not come within any of the three exceptions mentioned in article 497, and we are, therefore, expressly forbidden to retry questions of fact. So that, even if the evidence which the appellant asked to have sent up were all here, we would have no power to consider it. Neither would we have any power to examine it for the purpose of seeing if the court committed any error of law in receiving or excluding evidence, for the bill of exceptions states that the defendant took no exceptions to such erroneous rulings, if any there were. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated the motion is denied. The appellant is allowed thirty days from the entry of this order in which to file and transmit copies of his brief to the adverse party. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, withdrew from this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In this case Adriano Solar was convicted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan of the crime of  \"attempt to rape\" and sentenced to four years and two months imprisonment in the public prison of the province, with costs. He now appeals to this court from the judgment, and the only question raised by his appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence upon which his conviction was secured. The testimony for the prosecution as disclosed by the record is to the effect that about 10 o’clock of the morning of the 15th of November, 1901, the accused, Adriano Solar, having a knife in his hands, entered the house in which the prosecuting witness, Juliana Perez, then was and seizing her hands attempted to embrace her and to throw her on the floor. All this took place near an open window of the house and in the actual presence of Aniceta Solar, the aunt of Adriano Solar, and Potenciana Salcedo, the aunt of Juliana Perez. The accused said nothing from the time he entered the house and commenced the assault until he left it after the complainant, with the aid of the other two women, had released herself from him. The prosecutrix claims that she received injuries about the head and breast caused by the knife in the hands of Solar. From these injuries she says she recovered in about a week. <br/><br/>The only witness in behalf of the defense is the accused himself, who testified that he lived in the same house with his accuser and that she is the daughter of Antonio Perez and one Petra Salinas, who was the concubine of his father. He further says that he went to the house on the morning of the alleged offense and in the presence of Tomas Tirao, Maxima, his wife, and Aniceta Solar, ordered Juliana Perez to leave the house because she and her mother had stolen certain documents and money from him and had tried to bribe a man by the name of Pedro to kill him. He says, also, he inflicted no violence on the prosecutrix, and that she denounced him to the court in revenge for being ordered from the house. Neither Pedro, Tomas Tirao, nor his wife were produced as witnesses. <br/><br/>One of the essential elements of the crime of  \"attempt to rape\" is the intent to have carnal knowledge of a woman against her will, and in despite of any resistance she may make. If this element is wanting or the prosecution fails to establish it by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the charge is not made out and no conviction on it can be had. <br/><br/>The evidence in this case seems to show that an assault was committed, but hardly goes to the extent of establishing that it was committed with the intent to rape. There is no act, word, or deed which satisfactorily shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sought to have criminal knowledge of the person of the complaining witness or that his design was any other than the infliction on her of physical violence or bodily harm. <br/><br/>Any inference or presumption that he intended to violate the complainant which might be drawn from the fact that he seized her hands, put his arms about her, and attempted to throw her on the floor is overcome by the fact that these acts of violence were perpetrated in broad daylight near an open window in the presence of close relatives of both. Crimes against the chastity of women are not usually committed in the presence of persons not aiding and abetting the offense and much less in the immediate personal presence of kinswomen whose active opposition might be reasonably expected. <br/><br/>The evidence being insufficient to support the charge of  \"an attempt to rape\" the judgment based on it ought to be reversed, and it is so ordered, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Juan Luna for attempted abduction, and was brought before us by an appeal taken by the defendant against the judgment of the 12th of March last, by which he was condemned to one year eight months and twenty days of prision correccional, with accessories, and to the payment of costs. While the appeal was pending in this court the attorney for the appellant, by petition dated the 17th of May last, presented to the court a public instrument dated the 15th of the same month, by which, with the consent of the defendant, Tomasa Rivera y Felipe, a widow, who states that she is the mother of the minor Juana Isidro y Rivera, 12 years of age, the alleged victim of the crime prosecuted, granted an express pardon of the offense committed, as the representative of her said daughter, in favor of the defendant, Juan Luna, remitting the penalty to which he may have become liable, this pardon having been granted generously, without consideration of recompense and without coercion. The attorney for the defendant moved the court to declare that the penal action brought by the complaining witness was extinguished, and asked that the bail bond given by the defendant be cancelled. <br/><br/>This case deals with an offense in which the penal action or liability to the penalty fixed for its punishment may be extinguished by the express or implied pardon of the party offended, in accordance with the last paragraph of article 448 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The motion of the counsel for the defendant is based upon an express pardon, recorded in a public instrument, by the mother of the injured party, who, being a widow, exercises over the complaining witness the rights of parental authority. The Solicitor-General opposes this motion on the ground that the pardon was not granted by the injured party herself, as is expressly required by the Penal Code. <br/><br/>In view of the clear and precise terms in which paragraph 4 of article 448 is drawn, there can not be the slightest doubt that the express pardon for the offense must be granted by the injured party, and in case the injured party should be a minor, or should lack the necessary capacity to maintain an action, then, in order that the pardon have its effect, it is necessary that this defect be cured by the completion of this deficient personality. <br/><br/>In the third paragraph of article 448 it is provided that if the injured party, by reason of nonage or moral condition, should be without capacity to sue, and should be so unprotected as to be without parents, grandparents, brothers, tutor, or curator, then the fiscal may denounce the crime. It appears, therefore, that the right to prosecute the crime or to appear in the action is attributed in the first place to the person aggrieved, and, in the event of such person being unable to do so by reason of lack of personality, then the law designated in successive order the persons upon whom devolves the duty of prosecuting the crime. <br/><br/>Correlative to this precept, the following paragraph establishes the right, conferred by the law upon the injured party, to grant a pardon. In order that the pardon produce its effects it must be made by the person injured, or, in case that person be a minor, then the parents or guardian of such person must take part in the granting thereof. But the granting of pardon by these persons alone, in the name or on behalf of the minor, is not sufficient, because, as the offense essentially and directly affects the injured party, she alone is entitled to remit the offense and to authorize the extinction of the penal action. This pardon can only be presumed in the case of the marriage of the injured party with the offender, and can not be presumed from any act on the part of her representatives. <br/><br/>The best confirmatory demonstration of the doctrine that it is absolutely necessary and indispensable that the pardon be granted by the victim of the attempt herself is a decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 5th of January, 1898, applying the precept of section 4 of article 448 of the Penal Code, to the effect that a marriage entered into by a girl under age, although illegal because of lack of consent of the parents, is sufficient to produce the extinction of the penal action and of the penalty, because, by the celebration of this marriage, the pardon of the offense is presumed, and the crime is blotted out by the marriage of the injured party to the offender. Consequently, as it has not been made to appear that the offended party, Juana Isidro, has expressly pardoned the injury alleged to have been done her by the defendant Juan Luna, and the pardon of the girl’s mother not being sufficient to authorize the dismissal of the case in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code, we are of the opinion that the contention of the attorney for the defendant can not be sustained, and therefore the motion is overruled, with the costs, and the prosecution of this case in the second instance will be continued.

The American forces were then in possession of Pola, and he was performing such duties as the commander of those forces, through the municipal president, imposed upon him. In the early part of October he left the pueblo to bring from his sementera two of his children and some rice. he was captured by insurrectionary soldiers, and taken by them to their camp in the mountain, six hours from the barrio of Casiligan. There were in the camp between 150 and 200 revolutionary soldiers. The officer in command was Raymundo Corcuera, since deceased, before whom Eleno Afable was brought by his captors. The officer convened a council, of which the defendants Buenaventura Paola and Modesto Ramos, both officials inferior in rank to said Raymundo, formed a part. The latter asked the opinion of the other officers as to the acts of the accused and the disposition to be made of him. The investigation resulted in an order from Raymundo Corcuera that the prisoner be killed, because he was a spy of the Americans. <br/><br/>Six soldiers, under the command of the defendant Brigido Jimenez, were told off to execute the sentence. He was taken by the guard into the forest, about a thousand yards from the camp, and there decapitated by the defendant Miguel Monton. His body was brutally mutilated and buried at the place of execution. The guard returned to the camp, and Brigido Jimenez reported verbally to Raymundo Corcuera that his orders had been carried out. The defendant Victorio Pilar was one of these six men. <br/><br/>The five defendants were tried in the Court of First Instance of Mindoro for the murder of Eleno Afable. Buenaventura Paola, Modesto Ramon, Brigido Jimenez, and Miguel Monton were convicted and sentenced to death. Victorio Pilar was convicted and sentenced to twelve years and one day of cadena temporal. The case as to the first four has been brought here en consulta. Victorio Pilar did not appeal. The Solicitor-General and the counsel for the accused have joined in a motion that the defendants be discharged on the ground that they are included in the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902. <br/><br/>Under the circumstances above narrated it is clear that the murder of Eleno Afable was a crime of a political character. (United States v. Vicente Villamor, decided by this court, August 29, 1902; United States v. Carmona, decided by this court, August 19, 1902; In re Castioni (1891) Q. B., 149; In re Ezeta, 62 Fed. R., 972.) <br/><br/>At the time in question the defendants, Buenaventura Paola, Modesto Ramos, and Brigido Jimenez were participating against the United States in the insurrection then existing, and the murder was committed pursuant to an order issued by an officer engaged in that insurrection superior in rank to any of the defendants. Miguel Monton and Victorio Pilar both testified at the trial that they were prisoners to the insurrectionists. Federico Aguilar, one of the six, testified that they were all prisoners except Brigido Jimenez and Vicente Espinosa. The latter, Vicente Espinosa, in his testimony stated that he too was a prisoner. There is, however, direct testimony in the case that they were all insurrectionary soldiers. This is shown also by circumstances. A formation of all in the camp was made, from which the six men were selected. The six were all armed with bolos. They were over a thousand yards from the camp. If five of the six were prisoners, their escape could easily have been effected. We conclude that Miguel Monton and Victorio Pilar were participating against the United States in the insurrection, and that all of the defendants, except the said Pilar, are included within the said proclamation. <br/><br/>We have, however, no power to make any order in the case of Victor Pilar, as there was no appeal as to him, and his case could not come here in consulta. (Act No. 194 of the Commission.) <br/><br/>The defendants Buenaventura Paola, Modesto Ramos, Miguel Monton, and Brigido Jimenez are, therefore, declared to be entitled to the benefit of the proclamation, upon filing in this court the oath prescribed therein as a condition of the amnesty, and upon the filing of such oath the cause will be returned to the court below with directions that the defendants be discharged, with costs de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Appeal by counsel for Florencio Pozadas, allowed in both effects, from the order of the 24th of June, 1901, directing the reversal of the order giving Pozadas possession of the land referred to in this proceeding which is declared to be contentious, preserving to the parties their respective possession of land, with one-third part of the costs to the municipal president of the town of San Carlos, the other two-thirds of the costs to be paid by the plaintiff and the defendant, the said Pozadas being enjoined from molesting Domingo Martinez in his possession of the land in question. <br/><br/>By petition of the 13th of May, 1901, Florencio Pozadas, alleging that he was the owner of a parcel of land situated at a place called Pata, of the town of San Carlos, the extent and boundaries of which appear from the public instrument by which the land was acquired, recorded in the Register of Property, and which he exhibited as evidence of his rights of ownership, asked that he be judicially put in possession of the said land in accordance with the provisions of article 2015 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force. The petitioner prayed that the municipal president of San Carlos, acting as justice of the peace, be authorized to execute the order, and that the petitioner be given a transcript of the order directing that he be given possession of the lands, and also a transcript of the record of its execution, and that the public instrument exhibited by him be returned. <br/><br/>By order of the same date the court granted Pozadas’s petition, without prejudice to third persons with better right. On the 22d of May, after the publication of the edicts citing the owners of the adjacent lands; Pozadas was put in possession of the land referred to in the deed mentioned, without opposition on the part of any third person, and the area and boundaries of the land were recorded in the minutes of the proceeding. But the judge, by an order of the 25th of May, after an examination of these minutes, and in view of certain defects observed in the citation of the owners of the adjacent lands and the insufficient description of the boundaries, declared the act by which possession was given to be null and void, and ordered the municipal president of San Carlos to repeat the proceedings, after compliance with the formalities indicated. <br/><br/>The proceeding by which Pozadas was to be put in possession of the land claimed having been had de novo, the area and boundaries of which land were recorded in the minutes of the 31st of May, Domingo Martinez and Magdalena Martinez, husband and wife, appeared and made opposition thereto. <br/><br/>These individuals filed a petition on the 29th of May with the municipal president, the commissioner, asking that by virtue of the claims set forth therein, supported by documentary evidence, the possession which was about to be conferred de novo on Pozadas be suspended, if the land of which Magdalena Martinez was in possession as owner was included therein, and that report of this opposition be made to the Court of First Instance; but the municipal president, without granting this petition, notified the claimant Martinez to prosecute his claim before the Court of First Instance. This he did by filing a petition, dated the 1st of June, asking that the possession last conferred upon Pozadas be set aside, and that the latter be ordered to assert his rights in the corresponding civil action. <br/><br/>After an ocular inspection by the court, in pursuance with an order made by him in furtherance of justice, and upon a report by the clerk of the court, the order here appealed was entered, upon the ground that the possession given Pozadas by the last proceeding constituted an ouster from a judicial possession formerly conferred by final judgment rendered in a contradictory suit — a stronger title than a deed of sale, even if supported by a title obtained by composition with the State, which might be set aside in a similar action; that such a title might serve as a basis for obtaining the possession of realty by voluntary jurisdiction proceedings, provided this realty be not possessed by a third party, but that such proceedings should be suspended as soon as opposition is made by any third person, who can not be ousted without first having had his day in court; and that, therefore, it was the duty of the president of San Carlos to have suspended the proceedings by which he was conferring possession, in view of the opposition of Martinez and his wife. <br/><br/>This is a question concerning a proceeding of voluntary jurisdiction instituted for the purpose of obtaining judicial intervention in order to avoid damage which might be suffered in a property right, the petitioner to that end availing himself of the provisions of article 2015 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force. <br/><br/>The judge, in accordance with the provisions of article 2016 of the same Law, ordered that the possession solicited be given without prejudice to the rights of third persons. <br/><br/>It is true that on the 22d of May, 1901, Pozadas was placed in possession of the land to which the proceeding referred without opposition on the part of any third person, but it is also true that, by an order of the 25th of the same month, and for the reasons therein expressed, the proceeding by which possession was given was declared void, and directions were given that the proceeding be effected anew. <br/><br/>The order of the 25th of May having become final and unappealable, as the appellant took no exception thereto, we can not now discuss the question as to whether this order was correct or not; and therefore the new proceedings for giving possession of the 31st of the same month would have been perfectly legal had it not been for the opposition of Martinez and his wife before Pozadas was put in possession of the land. This opposition, made in due time, was sufficient to have given the proceedings a contentious character. <br/><br/>It must be remembered that the judicial order of possession can be executed only in case no opposition is made by a third person interested in the matter. This is the situation of Martinez and his wife, who allege that they are in possession under a claim of ownership of a piece of land included in the estate which was and is the object of Pozadas’s claim. The moment that opposition was made to the proceedings, as was that of Martinez and his wife, before possession was given, the execution of the order of possession should have been suspended, and the proceedings of voluntary jurisdiction dismissed, with the result of converting the action into one of contentious jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of article 1817 of the Law of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>From these considerations it is evident that the order appealed is without error, and, although the possession given Pozadas by the municipal president of San Carlos on the 31st of May, 1901, was in violation of the provisions of the said article 1817, nevertheless the fact that he was a layman and that he acted in good faith, as shown by the text of the order of the 20th of May, exempt him from responsibility or liability to any disciplinary correction, and for this reason no special order should have been made concerning the costs in the first instance. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds, therefore, we are of opinion that the order of the 24th of June, 1901, should be affirmed, with the costs of the second instance to the appellant, but the said order is understood as reversed with respect to the costs of the first instance and is to be understood as standing without any special declaration as to the costs of that instance.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Appeal by the defendant, Agustin Villanueva, against the judgment of the 18th of November, 1897, rendered in case No. 5606 by the court of La Laguna, for attempted estafa, by which he was condemned to pay 500 pesetas fine, or to the subsidiary personal penalty, and to the payment of one-third part of the costs. <br/><br/>On the 25th of November, 1884, Celestino Borlasa filed a complaint before the local authorities of the town of Lilio against Agustin Villanueva, stating that he, accompanied by Juan urna, had gone to the complainant’s house, and, after having examined the house, by order, as stated by Villanueva, of the forestry officer, Hermenegildo de Ocampo, and having observed that the house was built with new lumber, as well as several other houses also examined, demanded of the complainant the sum of 6 pesos and 2 reals for the purpose of avoiding a fine and with a view to preparing a petition for obtaining a free permit to cut timber. This amount the complainant was unable to pay, and Villanueva refused to receive 3 pesos, which was offered him by Borlasa. <br/><br/>This fact, proven by the testimony of two trustworthy witnesses, constitutes the crime of attempted estafa, defined and punished by section 1 of article 534 and section 1 of article 535 in connection with article 66 of the Penal Code. The facts established by the evidence in the case show that the attempt was made to obtain the sum of 6 pesos and 2 reals by fraudulent representations and for purposes not justified or authorized by the forestry law. If the estafa was not consummated it was because the complainant either could not or would not pay the amount demanded, and simply offered a little less than half, which the defendant, in turn, refused to accept. <br/><br/>The defendant, Agustin Villanueva, is guilty, as author by direct participation, of the crime of attempted estafa of a sum not exceeding 250 pesetas, by his own confession. Although the defendant did not succeed in consummating the crime of obtaining the money upon the fraudulent pretext of having been authorized by the forester, Hermenegildo de Ocampo, an employee of the Forestry Bureau, the fact is that he attempted to obtain the amount demanded and refused to receive the 3 pesos which the complainant offered him, this being less than one-half of the amount demanded. <br/><br/>All these facts are established by the testimony of the two witnesses there present and by another witness, who affirms that he saw Villanueva in conversation with the complainant, Celestino Borlasa, although not aware of the subject of their conversation. <br/><br/>The unsupported allegation by the defendant that he had acted under the orders and upon the authority of the ranger, Ocampo, who was not arrested and is still absent, can not serve as an excuse or relieve him from the charge brought against him, inasmuch as the forester was not authorized or empowered to give such orders, nor is such an action authorized by law. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime, and for the purpose or the imposition of the penalty, the concurrence of the aggravating circumstance of No. 18 of article 10 of the Code must be considered, because Villanueva has been already convicted by final judgment of three other crimes of estafa, and, therefore, no mitigating circumstance being present to offset the effects of the aggravating circumstance, the defendant must suffer the penalty prescribed by the law in its maximum degree, although, in consideration of the provisions of article 83 of the Code, and it not appearing that the financial position of the defendant is such that he may be classed as a rich man, which appears from the nature of the crime, the fine to which he has become liable should not be a heavy one, and therefore, by virtue of articles 26, 83, 92, and those above cited, section 50 of General Orders, No. 58, and the law of August 10, 1901, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed should be affirmed with reference to the defendant, Villanueva, but in case of inability to pay the fine, the subsidiary imprisonment can not exceed one month and one day, the preventive imprisonment suffered to be computed, the defendant to pay one-third of the costs of this instance, without special mention as to the defendant Juan Urna acquitted by the court below.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was convicted in the court below of falsificacion under article 304 in connection with No. 1 of article 300 of the Penal Code. The evidence at the trial tended to show that he had been furnished by his employer, Captain Harford, with money to pay certain shop bills contracted by the latter, and among others one of H. Price &amp; Co. for 64 pesos; that he signed the name of M. Legaspi, an employee of that firm, to what purported to be a receipt for the bill, which he then delivered to Captain Harford; and that he retained the money for about two weeks thereafter, when, having learned that his deception had been discovered, he sought out H. Price &amp; Co. and paid the bill to them. But as there was no evidence that he imitated or attempted to imitate Legaspi’s handwriting in the signature to the receipt the conviction can not be sustained. In order to constitute the crime of falsification by  \"counterfeiting or feigning any writing, signature, or rubric\" (Penal Code, art. 300, No. 1) there must be, as the language in which the crime is described imports, a similitude between the genuine and the pretended writing, signature, or rubric. This is the settled doctrine of the supreme court of Spain, and it has been adopted by this court. (The United States v. Emiliano Paraiso, decided November 13, 1901, citing decisions of the supreme court of Spain.)

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from the Court of First Instance of Manila, taken by the complaining witness, Julian Gonzalez, from a judgment of acquittal, upon a complaint for bigamy under article 471 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The defendant was married to the complaining witness in Manila, May 27, 1897. After living together in Manila for a time they separated, the defendant remaining in the house where they had been previously living until some time subsequent to July 12, 1900. On that day she was married in Manila by a Protestant clergyman to Ramon Martinez. Her defense is that she honestly believed her first husband was dead when she married Martinez. <br/><br/>It appears that the mother and some other relatives of Gonzalez lived, after the separation, in the same house with the defendant. Gonzalez testifies that the separation took place in March, 1900, and that he also lived for some months in the lower story of the same house, the defendant living in the upper story. He further testifies that after he left this house and went to live elsewhere he visited his relatives there nearly every day down to a few days before the trial, which took place in September, 1901. He says that he often saw his wife at these times, supplying her with means for her support through his relatives, but that he never spoke with her. A short time after her second marriage the defendant moved away from the house and has since lived elsewhere. <br/><br/>The defendant testifies that she and Gonzalez had been living together a year and two months when the separation took place. That would fix the date of the separation in July, 1898. She testifies that some time during the year following the separation she was told by the mother of Gonzalez that she had been informed that her son was dead, that thereupon prayers were said for his soul for nine nights, and that she put on mourning and wore it a year. She says that she contracted the second marriage with the consent of the mother of Gonzalez, and believing that the information which she had received from her as to the death of Gonzalez was true. The mother of Gonzalez died before the trial. <br/><br/>There was some further evidence from other witnesses on both sides, but it was of such a character as to throw but little light upon the facts of the case. On the whole, we have reached the conclusion, though not without some hesitation, that the story told by the defendant is in the main more likely to be true than false, and that she probably did contract the second marriage under a bona fide belief that the first marriage had been dissolved by the death of Gonzalez. <br/><br/>We have recently held, in the United States v. Marcosa Peñalosa and Enrique Rodriguez, decided January 27, 1902, that there can be no conviction under article 475 of the Penal Code, where by reason of a mistake of fact the intention to commit the crime does not exist, and we think the same principle must apply to this case. The defendant was therefore properly acquitted of the crime charged in the complaint. <br/><br/>We are, however, of the opinion that the defendant is chargeable with criminal negligence in contracting the second marriage, and should have been convicted under article 568 of the Penal Code. (See G. O., No. 58, sec. 29.) It does not appear that she made any attempt to ascertain for herself whether the information received by her mother-in-law as to the death of Gonzalez was to be relied upon. She never even saw or communicated directly in any way with the persons who gave her mother-in-law this information. Moreover, viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to her, she waited less than two years after hearing of the death of her husband before contracting the second marriage. The diligence with which the law requires the individual at all times to govern his conduct varies with the nature of the situation in which he is placed and with the importance of the act which he is to perform. In a matter so important to the good order of society as that in question, where the consequences of a mistake are necessarily so serious, nothing less than the highest degree of diligence will satisfy the standard prescribed by the law. We can not say that the defendant has acted with that diligence in the present case. <br/><br/>Applying the provisions of article 568 of the Penal Code, the act of contracting a second or subsequent marriage, the prior marriage not having been lawfully dissolved, being one which, if done with malice, would constitute a grave crime, the offense committed by the defendant is punishable by arresto mayor in its maximum degree to prision correccional in its minimum degree. There being no aggravating circumstance, and as we think the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code may properly be considered in this case, this penalty should be applied in its minimum degree. <br/><br/>We therefore sentence the defendant to four months and one day of arresto mayor and costs. The judgment of the court below will be modified in accordance with this opinion. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Smith, Willard, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the 20th of January, 1902, rendered in case No. 83 of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, by which the defendant was convicted of the crime of abduction and was sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of imprisonment with hard labor, to count from the day of the judgment, with the corresponding accessories, and to the payment of costs. <br/><br/>After 10 o’clock one night in the year 1900, day and month unknown, the defendant, Benigno de Vera, and several other men, provided with arms, went to the house of Rosa Magalon. De Vera immediately entered the house and seized Severina de Guzman, a girl some 18 years of age, the daughter of the owner of the house. Notwithstanding her opposition and her attempt to cling to her mother, he forcibly carried her off against her will, taking her out of the house. In the struggle he struck the girl’s mother a blow in the chest, upon which she fled from the house. The three women who were living in the house were unable to call for assistance or prevent the aggression, as they were overcome with fear. The abducted girl was placed on horseback by De Vera and taken to his house at a place called Bagnat, where she was held for three days and by threats compelled to accede to De Vera’s lewd desires, until Mariano Gonzalez, accompanied by several other men, came to the house and notwithstanding the opposition of the defendant succeeded in recovering the girl and restoring her to her mother’s house. <br/><br/>These facts constitute the crime of abduction, committed against the will of the victim, and with a lewd intent, a crime covered by article 445 of the Penal Code. The commission of the offense is fully proven by the testimony of the injured party, of her mother, and of another woman who lived with them in the house, all of whom uniformly testified to the occurrence in all its details. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding the plea of not guilty entered by the defendant, the evidence in the case is sufficient to establish his guilt. This evidence has not been contradicted by the defendant, who was present when the prosecuting witness testified and heard the testimony of each one of the witnesses for the prosecution without having alleged any exulpation or having made any attempt to show his innocence of the crime of which he is charged. <br/><br/>In the commission of the abduction for which this prosecution is brought, the circumstance of nocturnity, No. 15 of article 10 of the Code, must be considered in view of the fact that the defendant availed himself of the darkness and silence of night for the consummation of the crime. Furthermore, aggravating circumstance No. 20 of article 10 must be applied, by reason of the fact that the crime was committed in the dwelling of the offended person, this circumstance being compensated in its effects by article 11 as a mitigating circumstance to be applied in view of the nature of the crime, the disturbed condition of the country at the time the abduction took place, and the personal conditions of the defendant. Therefore the penalty assigned by the law must be imposed in its maximum degree. <br/><br/>Furthermore, with respect to the motion made by the counsel for the defendant for a dismissal of the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution was commenced without the express solicitation or instance of the offended party, it is a sufficient answer to consider the object and purpose of the penal law, which does not require a formal written denunciation as a basis for the prosecution of the crime of abduction. This formality is not required by article 448 of the Code, which expressly declares that it is not necessary that a formal petition be filed. <br/><br/>In this case the provincial fiscal filed an information by virtue of the complaint made to him by the complaining witness, who, with her mother, sustained and confirmed during the trial the action brought by the fiscal in the name of the Government. Therefore there is no legal reason or ground upon which the petition of the defendant that the proceedings be set aside can be granted, and, consequently, for the reasons stated, the defendant, Benigno de Vera, must be convicted and sentenced to the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of reclusion temporal, with the accessories designated in article 59, indemnification as a dowry for the girl Guzman of 500 Mexican pesos, and to acknowledge the issue, if any, unless the quality of its origin should prevent, and to support such issue, if any, and to pay the costs of both instances.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In the fall of 1901 Clayton J. Bailey was an inspector of the Constabulary and in command of the forces stationed in the Province of Tarlac. Complaints were made to him by some of the inhabitants of Gerona that the defendant had robbed them of carabaos and horses. After making investigations he seized about ninety head of stock in the possession of the tenants of the defendant and deposited this stock in the Government corral at Tarlac. Juan Jose produced at the trial, and there is attached to the record, a certificate of transfer to him in June, 1896, of a caraballa marked with the brands described in said certificate. The witness Bailey stated that he had personally compared the brands on one of the animals taken from Cardona’s farm, and at the time of the trial in the corral near the court-house, with the brands that are set forth in the said certificate and that they were the same. He also testified that Juan Jose had claimed this animal as his own. <br/><br/>Felix Llorente, an inspector of Constabulary of the fourth class, testified that the animal referred to by the witness Bailey had been taken from Cardona’s farm; that the day of the trial he had compared the marks on it with the marks on the certificate and that they were identical. <br/><br/>Juan Jose testified that about the 5th or 6th of March as he, in company with his uncle Paulo Jose and Cipriano Jose, was going toward Gerona with his caraballa and its calf, he met the defendant, Cardona, with four other persons in an unfrequented part of the road; that Cardona, holding a revolver at his head, told him to take himself off and leave his animals there together with the cart to which the caraballa was harnessed. That he at once departed with his uncle Paulo Jose and Cipriano Jose. Juan Jose then had in his pocket the said certificate, but Cardona made no inquiry for it. He testified that he had seen the animal referred to by Bailey then in the corral and that it was his. His uncle corroborated him as to the occurrence in the road, and also stated that since that date he had seen the caraballa of Juan in the said Government corral. <br/><br/>The testimony of the defense was directed to three points: (1) To show that Cardona was in Tarlac and not in Gerona about March 25; (2) to show his good character, and (3) to the fact that one Paulo Tañedo had bought in August, 1901, at public auction held in Gerona by the municipal authorities, the caraballa taken from Juan Jose. <br/><br/>(1)\tThe evidence is ample to show that Cardona by violence and intimidation took from Juan Jose his caraballa and sent it to his, Cardona’s farm, from which it was taken by the Constabulary. There was no attempt whatever to contradict the statements of Juan and Paulo Jose as to the forcible taking of the animal; and the identification of it with the one seized on Cardona’s farm was only sought to be overcome by the testimony of Paulo Tañedo, but that testimony and the documents presented on a motion for a new trial fall far short of accomplishing it. The most that Tañedo would say was that he did not know whether the caraballa which he had bought was the one taken from Jose or not; that his had three marks, one of which was like one of those on Juan Jose’s but the other two were not. The documentary evidence in connection with the public sale to Paulo Tañedo shows also that only one of the three marks corresponds to any of the three marks on the animal of Juan Jose. <br/><br/>(2)\tThe testimony as to the whereabouts of the defendant on March 25 was unimportant, as the evidence shows the robbery was committed about the 5th or 6th of March. The defendant in his brief claims that the evidence should be restricted to the date mentioned in the complaint, which was the 25th of March. In this case, however, the date was not a material ingredient of the offense, and under the provisions of article 7 of General Orders No. 58, the Government was not limited in its proof to the date stated therein. <br/><br/>(3)\tThe testimony as to good character could not in any event outweigh such positive and uncontradicted evidence as was produced in this cause to show defendant’s guilt. It is to be noted moreover that some of the defendant’s witnesses on this point admitted on cross-examination that they had heard that the defendant’s reputation prior to the American occupation of these Islands was bad. <br/><br/>(4)\tIn the petition for a new trial it is alleged that the trial was void because the evidence was not read over to the witnesses before they signed it as required by article 32, General Orders, No. 58. But it does not affirmatively appear that this was not done, and, even if it were not, this, without anything more appearing, would be a defect of form for which the judgment could not be reversed. (Art. 10, General Orders, No. 58.) <br/><br/>(5)\tThe defendant has filed a petition that he be discharged because he is included in the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902. It is obvious that this petition must be denied. <br/><br/>(6)\tThe offense proven is covered by article 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code. The complaint did not allege that the offense was committed in an unfrequented place. It is not necessary to decide whether without such an allegation the defendant could be convicted under the provisions of article 504, as we arrive at the same result which the court below reached by considering the fact that the offense was committed in an unfrequented place as an aggravating circumstance under the provisions of article 10. <br/><br/>(7)\tThere is not, in our opinion, sufficient evidence to show that the defendant in the commission of the crime took advantage of his official position as provincial secretary, so as to make applicable article 10, No. 11, of the Penal Code. Juan Jose testified that he did not know that Cardona held this office. It is true that he stated on cross-examination that he believed Cardona to be one of the authorities of Gerona, but we do not think this sufficient to justify us in saying that his official position was a material factor in the crime. Juan Jose was induced to abandon his property by the revolver which Cardona held at his head and by the fact that four men accompanied Cardona. <br/><br/>(8)\tThe defendant in his brief asks us to apply in his favor article 11 of the Penal Code as an attenuating circumstance. It is clear that we are not warranted in making any such application of this provision. <br/><br/>(9)\tThe presence of the aggravating circumstance which we have taken into consideration raises the punishment to the maximum grade. The penalty imposed by the judge below is within that grade, and the judgment is consequently affirmed with costs of this instance to the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Ladd, Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

A. Kincaid, counsel for the accused, filed a motion praying that the two accused be given the benefits of a general amnesty proclaimed by the President of the United States on July 4 last, and that the case be dismissed with the costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Counsel for the accused alleged that upon grounds of prudence and humanity, with a view to the establishment of peace and order and to promote the loyalty of the Filipino people to the sovereignty of the United States, the American Government, as a political measure, on the memorable Fourth of July, the anniversary of the independence of the United States, granted a full and general amnesty for the benefit of all Filipinos who took part in the insurrection against the Government of Spain, and who had committed during such revolution acts in violation of law, as also in favor of persons guilty of crimes which were the result of internal political feuds or of dissensions between the Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities during that insurrections; that in the judgment below certain facts were found which, if true, would constitute a crime resulting from political hatred between the accused and the deceased, Piera, and committed in the course of the said insurrection; that for these reasons the crime of murder of which they are charged and of which they have not yet been convicted, is clearly within the amnesty, whatever might be the punishment they might deserve, it being the will of the sovereign power that these offenses be remitted and their presumptive authors pardoned, they being Filipinos. <br/><br/>This case involves a most heinous crime committed on the person of Salvador Piera, lieutenant in the Spanish army, under greatly aggravated circumstances, the crime having been committed about the end of September or the beginning of October in 1898 by order of Simeon Villa, at that time a major in the revolutionary army and commanding officer of the forces occupying the district of Isabela. <br/><br/>A few days after Simeon Villa arrived at Ilagan as major of troops of the Filipino revolution he telegraphed Colonel Tiron, then in Aparri, to send Piera to him, the latter being at that time a prisoner of the revolutionary forces, in order to take Piera’s deposition; this Villa did, according to the accusors, at the instigation of Dimas Guzman, whose purpose it was to take revenge upon Lieutenant Piera, who was judge in a military prosecution which in 1897 was brought against Guzman on political grounds, by which reason the latter was a bitter enemy of Piera and of others who had taken part in the said prosecution; that, therefore, Guzman intended to revenge himself upon various Spaniards, and as soon as he became aware of the proximity of the Filipino revolutionary forces, Guzman went out to meet them, and subsequently some of the revolutionary officers were lodged in the house of the Guzman family, Dimas Guzman being possessed of great influence with the people by reason of his social standing and the abnormal condition of affairs. <br/><br/>As soon as Lieut. Salvador Piera arrived at the house in which Major Villa resided, the latter and the accused, Isidro and Jose Guzman, beat and kicked Piera, clubbed him with their guns, and then, having tied his arms behind his back, hung him from the roof of the parochial residence, letting him fall to the ground from time to time until he died, they subsequently burying his body in a hole which to that end had been dug near the said house. <br/><br/>No matter how odious and repugnant may be the crime of which the unfortunate Salvador Piera was the victim, and who, as a prisoner of war, was under the protection of the laws of war and of international law, for which reason the party or parties guilty of his horrible death have violated those laws and were subject to the heaviest penalties, from the moment in which the sovereign power of the territory in which the crime occurred saw fit to decree a remission and forgetfulness of a certain class of offenses, blotting out even the shadow of crime for reasons of state and motives of humanity, obedience to the will of the sovereign is compulsory and must result in the final dismissal of prosecutions instituted for the punishment of crimes expressly included within the amnesty proclaimed. <br/><br/>After a long and profound disturbance which has caused a moral, material, and radical upheaval of the Filipino people, and in view of the fact that during the revolution crimes due to or characterized by political passions have been committed, the amnesty proclaimed on July 4 last constitutes an act of policy, of wise prudence, and well-timed generosity, freely exercised by the President of the Union for high political motives for the purpose of tempering or mitigating the rigor of the law, following the dictates of common sense and a humane conscience, based upon the fact that society would suffer more by the execution of the penalty than by allowing crimes committed under the impulse of partisan spirit and agitated passions to go unpunished. <br/><br/>The record shows that the accused, Isidro and Jose Guzman, took part in the rebellion against the Spanish Government, and that they were officers of the revolutionary army and rendered services thereto, and also, passing upon the responsibility of the accused, that the murder of Lieutenant Piera was the result of political hatred and of dissensions between the accused, especially those of the Guzman family and the deceased — political hatreds which were the general rule between Spaniards or agents of the Spanish Government and the Filipinos. This is shown by the proceedings had in the case, and for these reasons and in accordance with the spirit, letter, purpose, and object of the decree of amnesty it is unquestionable that the said Jose and Isidro Guzman are properly included within its scope. <br/><br/>The words  \"When the Bastile fell, the day arrived for the settlements of accounts,\" \"Now you will give me satisfaction,\" and  \"Now we are even,\" addressed to the dead body of Piera and attributed by various witnesses to the accused, Jose and Isidro Guzman, among others, show that between the latter and the deceased, Piera, there existed enmity, hatred, and malice, and confirm the statement above made. <br/><br/>It is true that murder pertains to the class of common crimes, but it is also true that the murder in question was committed in violation of the laws of war, and in consequence of hatred and dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or authorities and officers of the Government of Spain, which arose from acts and feuds of a political nature; and that, therefore, notwithstanding the cruel and inhuman manner in which the unfortunate Piera was assassinated, there is no well-grounded reason to be deduced from the text of the said proclamation which can reasonably prevent the application of the amnesty in favor of the petitioners without misconstruing the meaning and high design of this sovereign disposition, which, under the circumstances then prevailing in the country, is an act of justice political rather than judicial in its nature. <br/><br/>Upon these considerations we are of the opinion that justice requires that the accused, Isidro and Jose Guzman, be declared to be included within the amnesty of July 4 of this year and entitled to enjoy its benefits; orders will, therefore, be given the judge of First Instance of Isabela, in order that after the taking of the oath prescribed as a condition in the said decree of amnesty the accused be immediately set at liberty, with directions to the judge to transmit the record of his proceedings in fulfillment of this order together with the original oaths, and upon their receipt let the court be informed thereof. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Justices Smith and Mapa did not participate in the hearing of this motion. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The complaint, which is for estafa, charges the defendant with having received three sums of money, viz, 5 pesos from Potenciano Ebora, 10 pesos from Marcelo Cueto, and 38 pesos from Isidoro Castillo, in payment of dues for timber cut on public lands; that he received these sums with obligation to pay them over to the United States and that he appropriated them to his own use to the prejudice of the United States. <br/><br/>The court below found the defendant guilty as to all three sums under article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, which punishes  \"those who, to the prejudice of another, shall appropriate or misapply any money, goods, or any kind of personal property which they may have received as a deposit, on commission, for administration, or in any other capacity producing the obligation to deliver or return the same, or who shall deny having received it.\" The defendant appealed. <br/><br/>The defendant was a ranger in the employ of the Forestry Bureau of the Insular Government in the Province of Batangas. His duties were to measure timber cut on the public lands and issue certificates of the amount cut and other particulars to the parties liable to the payment of the dues himself. <br/><br/>The payments by Potenciano Ebora and Marcelo Cueto and that by Isidoro Castillo must be considered separately. <br/><br/>(1)\tAs to the payments by Ebora and Cueto: Ebora testified that he paid the defendant 5 pesos 71 centimos and 4 octavos, and that he was with Marcelo Cueto when the latter, at the defendant’s instance, paid him 10 pesos, and that these sums were paid for licenses for boats, or, as we think he in effect says, as dues for timber used in the construction of boats belonging to Ebora and Cueto, respectively. The defendant, who testified in his own behalf, admitted the receipt of these sums, and that they were received by him as charges due the Government. He, however, says that the 5 pesos and 71 centimos were received from one Lorenzo Cueto and not Ebora. His testimony is in accord with Ebora’s as to the 10 pesos having been received from Marcelo Cueto. Neither Lorenzo Cueto nor Marcelo Cueto testified at the trial. <br/><br/>As to the date of the receipt of these sums there is no evidence except that of the defendant, who says that the 5 pesos 71 centimos were received in August, 1901, and the 10 pesos on the 13th of the succeeding month. The payments were made at Batangas, the capital of the Province. <br/><br/>The defendant was arrested September 28, 1901, and up to that date he had not paid the money into the Treasury or made any other disposition of it for the benefit of the parties from whom he had received it. <br/><br/>The defendant in his testimony undertook to explain and justify his conduct in receiving and retaining these sums. This part of his testimony is confused and obscure, but the purport appears to be, with reference to the payment of the 5 pesos 71 centimos, that it was only a partial payment, the boat not being at the time completed, and it being, therefore, impossible to ascertain the total amount that would be payable respecting it, and that it was understood that upon the completion of the boat the owner was to return and pay whatever balance might then be found to be due. With reference to the other sum the defendant says that he was obliged to go to Lemery on official business the day the payment was made, and that he therefore issued to Marcelo Cueto a provisional certificate, and that Cueto was to wait till his return on the following day, when he was to provide him with the definite certificate or order for payment to the Treasury, but that upon his return he found that Cueto had left town. We are unable to perceive that this evidence, admitting its truth, suggests any justification or excuse either for the original receipt of the money in either instance or for its subsequent retention. It was the defendant’s duty, immediately upon the receipt of these sums or within a reasonable time thereafter, to pay them into the public treasury. He had, indeed, no authority to receive them on behalf of the Government. But once having received them, although wrongfully, he was under obligation to the parties from whom he had received them, an obligation arising ex maleficio, to apply them to the purposes for which they had been delivered to him. His failure to do this — in the case of the 10 pesos for about two weeks and in the case of the other sum for a considerably longer period — furnishes in itself and without the necessity of taking into consideration his confession, to which we shall advert in another connection, an amply sufficient basis for the inference that he had fraudulently converted them to his own use. This constitutes the crime of estafa under the section of the Penal Code above quoted. The persons injured by the estafa were, however, the persons to whom the money belonged and not, as the complaint charges and as the court below finds, the Government of the United States, the payment to the defendant, by reason of his lack of authority to receive it, not having operated as payment of the debts due the Government. The indemnification should, therefore, be in the one case to Potenciano Ebora, who we think was the person who paid the 5 pesos 71 centimos, and in the other to Marcelo Cueto. The point that the allegation of the complaint, as to the person injured by the commission of the offense, is erroneous has not been raised by the defendant, and would not avail him if it had been raised. (G. O. 58, sec. 7)<br/><br/>(2)\tThe case stands upon a different footing with regard to the payment of Castillo. The defendant admits the receipt of 38 pesos from him — 13 pesos September 13 and 25 pesos September 25 — but says that he received the money to hold as a fund, upon which Castillo, who lived some distance from the capital of the province and found it inconvenient and dangerous to make frequent journeys there to pay timber dues, might draw to that purpose as occasion required. This evidence does not appear to us unreasonable, and there is nothing in the record to contradict it, Castillo himself, by whom it might have been disproved if false, not having been called as a witness. If it is to be believed, as we think it must be, the only obligation resting upon the defendant with respect to this money was to hold it till Castillo should direct its payment by him to the Government. So far as appears from the evidence, no such direction had ever been given. The fact that the money had not been paid into the treasury by the defendant can not, therefore, be used, as in the case of the payment by Ebora and Cueto, as the basis for an inference that it had been appropriated by him. <br/><br/>There is some evidence that the defendant, when threatened with arrest, made a verbal statement to Mr. Blanchard, the provincial treasurer of Batangas, confessing the receipt of 53 pesos in timber dues, and naming Ebora, Marcelo Cueto, and Castillo as the persons from whom he had received the money, and that he acknowledged that he had spent the money for medicine, and there is also evidence that subsequently, while in confinement, he wrote Florencio Caedo, the provincial Secretary of Batangas, to the same effect, except that he stated in this letter that he had lost the money gambling. The letter was not produced; the evidence as to the verbal confession is not as full, as clear, or as specific as is desirable in evidence of this character, and the defendant retracted the confession at the trial. <br/><br/>Even if we were satisfied upon this evidence that the defendant made use of the money received from Castillo for his own purposes, there would still, we think, be grave doubt whether upon this single fact, unaccompanied by any evidence tending to show that by so doing he placed it out of his power to perform the obligation he was under to Castillo, a fraudulent and prejudicial appropriation could be predicated. It would seem that if by the use of the money he did not alter his situation with reference to his ability to perform the obligation, he would not be guilty of estafa until the time for its performance had arrived and he had made default therein. (See 3, Viada, Penal Code, 515-516.) We do not decide this question in the present case, because, upon the whole, we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by the uncorroborated evidence as to the confession that the money received from Castillo ad been applied for his own use by the defendant prior to his arrest. The result is that he must be acquitted as to the 38 pesos received from Castillo. <br/><br/>The fact that the defendant is a mestizo was improperly considered by the court below as an aggravating circumstance. Nor are there any facts in the case which warranted the court in finding the existence of the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 12, viz, that means were employed or circumstances brought about which added ignominy to the natural effects of the act. There remains only the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 11, viz, that advantage was taken by the accused of his official position, which we think was properly applied by the court below. <br/><br/>In the view we have taken of the case it will not be necessary to specially consider any of the defendant’s assignments of error, all of which, we think, have been covered in substance by what has been already said. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the defendant is found guilty of two distinct offenses of estafa under article 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, each of a sum less than 250 pesetas, with the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 11, in each case, for each of which offenses he is sentenced to three months and one day of arresto mayor, the sentences to be served consecutively, and to perpetual special disqualification, in accordance with the provisions of article 399, and to indemnify Potenciano Ebora in the sum of 5 pesos and Marcelo Cueto in the sum of 10 pesos, the costs of this instance to be de oficio. The cause will be remanded to the court below for the execution of this judgment.

We can not admit as possible a third construction under which the court would decide the question, excluding from the consideration of it the members challenged. This construction would, if adopted, put it in the power of a party to stop all proceedings in the cause by challenging three of the justices. The court has examined the original documents referred to at the argument, and we find nothing in them to support the challenge or which expresses an opinion on the merits of the case. Inasmuch as the complaint of the fiscal had for its purpose the compelling of the judge to comply with the law, and as this officer had failed to send up the report which he had been directed to make in accordance with the complaint of the fiscal, now a Justice of this court, the latter simply made a written request that the judge be directed to send in this report — a mere matter of procedure. <br/><br/>In accordance with article 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force the challenge should have been made in writing, but it appears to the court more convenient to settle the question on the merits, and for the reasons stated the challenge is not allowed and the hearing of the motion will be continued on Monday next. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, withdrew from this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant in this case was brought to trial in the Court of First Instance of Manila on the charge of estafa, and after a full hearing of the case he was acquitted. From the judgment of acquittal the prosecuting attorney took an appeal to this court by virtue of the provisions of General Orders, No. 58, sections 43, 44, et seq., and the defendant now asks that the appeal so taken be dismissed on the ground that the Government is  \"not entitled to an appeal from a finding of not guilty and a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case.\" A similar motion heretofore made by counsel for the accused was denied by this court. The renewal of the motion is based on the theory that portion of the  \"Philippine Bill\" recently passed by Congress which secures a defendant against more than one jeopardy of punishment for the same offense ought to receive the same construction given like provisions in the Constitution of the United States and the constitutions of various States of the Union, and that therefore the previous ruling should now be reversed. <br/><br/>The court is still of the opinion that no jeopardy attaches to the defendant until the judgment for or against him has become final, and that the act of Congress temporarily providing for the administration of affairs in the Philippines affords no ground for any change in the ruling made on the first motion. Now, as then, the question is, Has the defendant been placed once in jeopardy by his trial and acquittal in the lower court? If he has, then he can not again be tried on the same charge, and the appeal ought not to be entertained, as no result could follow its determination. If he has not, then the appeal must be heard and determined in conformity with the law of procedure now in force in these Islands. <br/><br/>All civilized peoples are substantially agreed that when a person accused of crime has been once finally convicted or acquitted of the charge against him he ought not to be vexed again by a prosecution for the same offense. The plea of once in jeopardy is the res adjudicata of the criminal case. <br/><br/>But just when the right to the plea accrues, just when a defendant may call it to his protection and avail himself of it as a shield against further prosecution on the same charge has presented, particularly to some American courts, difficulties which, by the way, do not arise from any perplexities inherent in the plea itself, but rather from a more or less rigid adherence to a long line of precedents which nobody seems willing to disturb but which nearly all admit have now but little if any sound reason to support them. <br/><br/>Formerly, in England, the right to plead jeopardy after an acquittal or conviction was the necessary adjunct, the indispensable auxiliary of the trial by jury, inasmuch as the right of trial by his peers, reluctantly conceded as a remedy for judicial abuses, would have availed the citizen but little if the verdict of the twelve men, good and true, had been left to the mercy of a pliant judiciary who were the mere creatures of the authority or influence which made them. <br/><br/>Hence, no appeal was permitted from the verdict of the jury or from the judgment entered in conformity with it. Both were final, and therefore the jeopardy became complete, not because there had been a conviction or an acquittal but because the question of innocence or guilt, of punishment or no punishment, had been finally determined beyond all possibility of judicial change or alteration. From the fact, however, that the verdict of the jury marked the final and definite determination of the proceeding, it came to be regarded as the test of whether or not there was a complete jeopardy, and from this in its turn arose the correlative principle that once the trial had been begun before a competent court and jury, upon a valid indictment, no step backward being possible, any discharge of the jury not resulting by consent of the prisoner or from a cause beyond the control of the court, perfected a jeopardy of the accused which he might plead in any subsequent prosecution against him on the same charge. This construction, by which the verdict of the jury and not the final determination of the case was made the test of an accrued jeopardy, could affect no rights in England, either of the State or of the accused, inasmuch as the same result had to follow whether one construction or the other was adopted. <br/><br/>In some few States of the Union, however, whose constitutions gave voice to the common-law maxim that no man should be brought in jeopardy twice for the same offense, the acceptance of the verdict of the jury as the sole test of the accomplished jeopardy resulted in the reading into the constitutional provision the finality of a verdict of acquittal and the enunciation of the consequent doctrine that from a verdict of acquittal there could be no appeal, even though such a step were expressly authorized by statutory enactment. This, too, although the courts of these very States found it entirely consistent to uphold the right of an accused to appeal from a judgment of conviction and secure a new trial upon the convenient doctrine, lugged in by the ears, that by taking an appeal the defendant waived his right to plead jeopardy. That is to say, he waived his plea — a most substantial right — when he sought by appeal to have an illegal conviction set aside for errors committed against him; but when the State invoked the same remedy to vacate an illegal acquittal secured, let us say, by his successful objection to proper, competent, and material evidence of his guilt, he waived nothing. <br/><br/>The proposition that a person accused of crime is entitled to have an illegal and improper judgment against him modified, corrected, and set aside and that the State can have no relief against a similar judgment in his favor, has neither sound sense nor sound law to support it. It prevents uniformity in the administration of justice and strikes at the ultimate purpose of all jurisprudence — a correct judgment, legally obtained. The defendant has no higher right to be protected against an improper conviction than has the body politic to be secured against an unlawful acquittal and a miscarriage of justice. At first, when judges were the corrupt and willing tools of tyrannical power, there may have been good reason for not permitting an appeal by either side from the verdict of twelve men duly selected to try the case, but when the courts became good enough to pass on the validity of a verdict of conviction, it would seem that they might be safely trusted to pass on the legality of a verdict of acquittal. When the reason for the rule ceased, the rule ought to have ceased with it, and at all events it should not be read into the organic law as a limitation on legislative power to provide a proper remedy for the correction of judicial errors and mistakes. <br/><br/>But even if the cases cited by respondent (People v. Weber, 38 Cal., 467, and 19 Ill., 342) are correct in construing that the constitutional provision on jeopardy makes the judgment of acquittal final and beyond attack or impeachment, their authority is of little avail in support of the motion unless it can be further shown that Congress adopted the jeopardy clause of the  \"Philippines Bill,\" not in the light of existing insular laws but in the light of a judicial construction applicable at best to jury trials, which have not now, never have had, and are not likely to have in the immediate future any place in the jurisprudence of the Archipelago. <br/><br/>The court is of the opinion that Congress did nothing of the kind. Any other conclusion would lead to the assumption that Congress intended the provision under discussion to be interpreted by precedents not only far from satisfactory to many of the best jurists of its own country but wholly at variance with the judicial system, procedural law, and established precedents of the people for whose benefit the law was enacted. <br/><br/>Before the change of sovereignty there never was in the Philippine Islands any finality to the judgment of the trial court in felony cases until it had been ratified and confirmed by the court of last resort. Such a judgment was merely advisory to the appellate tribunal, and might be modified, set aside, or changed, on a review of the record, either to the benefit or the prejudice of the defendant, with or without an appeal. Whether the Court of First Instance acquitted the defendant or convicted him, he could not be placed at liberty in the one case or receive the punishment adjudged in the other until the reviewing authority had finally affirmed the judicial determination of the lower court. More than that, if the trial court acquitted the accused, the Audiencia (Supreme Court) might convict him, and if he was convicted it might raise or lower his punishment or even acquit him altogether. <br/><br/>This was the law of the land when the change of sovereignty took place, and it has only been modified since to the extent of making the judgments of Courts of First Instance in felony cases (except those for capital offenses) final unless an appeal has been taken either by the Attorney-General or the accused. So then, so now: Once a criminal cause is before the court, whether on appeal or on review, the judgment may be changed, altered, or reversed as to the appellate tribunal may seem proper. <br/><br/>Not being inconsistent with the act of Congress, this law can not be construed to have been repealed by implication, and it must be held to be now in full force for the purposes it was designed to affect. <br/><br/>To be in jeopardy in the legal sense it is not sufficient that the danger should have begun. It must also have ended before the plea can be made effectual. Jeopardy is not the peril of more than one trial, but the peril of more than one punishment, and in the same proceeding there can be no danger of a second punishment until the first has been finally adjudged. <br/><br/>Attention is called to the following decisions of this court and its immediate predecessor: D. Juan Garcia v. D. Cesar Lopez Gascon, Criminal Branch Supreme Court of Justice, P. I., September 12, 1900; United States v. D. Mateo Perez, Supreme Court, P. I., April 9, 1902. <br/><br/>For the foregoing reasons the court is of the opinion that respondent’s motion to dismiss the appeal taken by the Government must be denied, and it is so ordered, with costs against the moving party. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The defendants were tried in the Court of First Instance in the city of Manila and acquitted of the charge. <br/><br/>The acquittal of the defendants was based upon the fact that such contradictions were found in the evidence as to cause a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendants. We have examined the testimony and find many discrepancies which seem to justify the conclusion reached by the Court of First Instance. The prosecuting witness, Benita Varela, in her testimony states that on the 2d day of December, 1901, she delivered to the defendants, Sotera Galvez and Matea Jose, twelve pieces of jusi cloth and forty pieces of piña cloth with the understanding that the cloth was to be sold and money paid over, or the goods returned that same evening. That the defendants disappeared and never returned again; that Sotera had been her laundry woman for two or three years; that the goods were delivered to the defendants jointly, but on the faith of her acquaintance with Sotera. In her testimony she says that she began to look for Sotera after Christmas and contradicts this by saying that she began the search for Sotera on the day the goods were delivered to her, December 2. She says that she saw Sotera only once afterwards, then testifies that she saw her twice. She testifies that Sotera continued as her laundry woman until the date of arrest — 13th of February. Sotera also testifies this. It is hardly probable that the witness should have retained Sotera as laundry woman if such defalcation had occurred, and still less probable if Sotera so continued that the witness not have seen her quite frequently. <br/><br/>The witness testifies that she never had a like transaction with the defendants except on December 2, when the twelve pieces of jusi and forty pieces of piña were delivered. The testimony of the accused Sotera shows that she had been in the habit for a long time of taking goods on commission from the prosecuting witness. Both defendants deny the occurrence out of which the prosecution arose, but testify to previous transactions had with the prosecuting witness. <br/><br/>There are other discrepancies in the statements made by the prosecuting witness and also in the statements made by the other witnesses produced. While there is evidence to show that the transaction occurred, as stated by the prosecuting witness, and testimony showing a confession by the defendants of having had a transaction with the prosecuting witness on the date mentioned, still there are such discrepancies in the evidence as would cause a reasonable doubt, and the Court of First Instance did not err in acquitting the defendants. <br/><br/>The judgment of acquittal is affirmed, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The facts alleged in the complaint compel me to resolve the doubt in favor of the plaintiff;\" and that the petitioner, in answer to the complaint, denied the principal allegation of fact therein, to wit, the mutual agreement to be husband and wife alleged by the plaintiff to have been entered into before witnesses; that while the case was in this condition the plaintiff filed a motion for a monthly allowance as alimony, costs, and attorney’s fees; that on the 22d of July last the said judge ordered the petitioner to pay the plaintiff, in advance, a monthly allowance of 250 Mexican pesos from and after the 11th of March last past, and to pay on the 1st day of August following all accrued allowances, in addition to the allowance for the said month, amounting to the sum of 1,500 pesos; that the plaintiff in the said action owns no property, and the judge not having required from her any security, it is certain that the petitioner, defendant in the said action below, should judgment be rendered in his favor, would be unable to recover such sums as the judge might compel him to disburse; that against the ruling of the court he has no right of appeal or any plain, speedy, or adequate remedy; therefore he prays the court to render judgment declaring the Hon. William J. Rohde, judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, has acted in excess of his jurisdiction in attempting to oblige petitioner to pay to the said Victorina Obin the said allowance, and to direct that a writ of prohibition issue to the said William J. Rohde prohibiting him from attempting to compel petitioner to pay the said amount. <br/><br/>Against this petition the attorney for the respondent, William J. Rohde, filed a demurrer and motion to dismiss upon the following grounds: (1) That this court is without jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action; (2) that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. It is to be observed that in the oral argument and brief filed no denial was made, but on the contrary the fact alleged by the petitioner was affirmed in that the ruling on the demurrer in the Court of First Instance the respondent had expressed his opinion that  \"the question (as to the alleged marriage) is not clear nor free from doubt.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"Nevertheless,\" he says,  \"this being so, the said Victorina Obin acquired a right to all conjugal rights, and in particular to the allowance of alimony pendente lite.\" And upon this supposition he cited articles of the Civil Code as to rights enjoyed by a married woman by virtue of the marriage, and those which she may further exercise by reason of divorce pending litigation and those granted to her finally in case of a favorable judgment. <br/><br/>The entire theory developed by the demurrer now before us may be expressed in the following terms: The respondent judge had jurisdiction to try the divorce case and its incidents, among others that of alimony; in an interlocutory ruling he held that the alleged matrimony existed, although it appeared to him to be a matter not clear or free from doubt; in another interlocutory order, notwithstanding the fact that the existence of the marriage is not clear or free from doubt, he directed an allowance of alimony pendente lite in favor of the plaintiff; against this interlocutory order no appeal lies on behalf of the alleged husband who is to pay this allowance; this alleged husband must pay it without any guaranty of recovery in the event that the proof should establish a contrary condition of affairs to that assumed to be correct, notwithstanding the fact that the question is not clear or free from doubt; and as the judge is not devoid of jurisdiction, and as no appeal lies against an interlocutory order, that such an opinion, such an interlocutory order so rendered, although erroenous and causing irreparable damage, can not be reviewed by any other court during the course of the trial. <br/><br/>Such a theory was not possible in these Islands under its former Law of Civil Procedure, nor is it possible now under the present Code of Civil Procedure. Under article 1591 of the old Code any person believing himself entitled to that provisional alimony or support was required to file with the complaint documents proving conclusively the title by virtue of which the same was sued for. If the title was based upon a right created by law, it was necessary to present the documents establishing the bond of relationship between the plaintiff and defendant or the circumstances which gave a right to the alimony, such evidence to be completed by the testimony of witnesses if necessary. The judge, under article 1592, could not admit the complaint unless the documents referred to in the preceding article were submitted. it is evident from this that under the provisions of the law then in force a suit for alimony could not prosper upon the mere opinion of the judge expressed, not in a final judgment causing status, but in an interlocutory order which has no other purpose than to facilitate the continuance of the trial. This, apart from the fact that under the former procedural law every interlocutory order not merely of practice was appealable, and consequently the case of one finding himself prejudiced by an order capable of causing him irreparable damage, such as that of paying an allowance without security or possibility of recovery, could never arise under that system of legislation. <br/><br/>The necessity of founding the action for support or alimony on a title, and a title supported by documentary evidence, is a consequence of the precepts of article 143 of the Civil Code cited by the respondent judge himself. In this article the right to support is granted (1) to spouses inter se; (2) to legitimate descendants and ascendants inter se; (3) to parents and certain legitimated and acknowledged natural children; (4) to other illegitimate children, and (5) to brothers and sisters. In all these cases it is a civil status or a juridical relation which is the basis of the action for support — the civil status of marriage or that of relationship. <br/><br/>In the present case the action for the support or alimony is brought by a woman who alleges that she is a wife; therefore it is necessary for her to prove possession of the civil status of a spouse — that is, a marriage, without which one has no right to the title of husband or wife. Marriages celebrated before the adoption of the Civil Code must be proven by the means established by the former laws (art. 53).  \"Marriages celebrated before the operation of the Code,\" says Q. Mucius Scaevola,  \"Must be proven by the canonical certificate.\" (Vol. 2, p. 137.)  \"Before the Council of Trent,\" says manresa,  \"no absolute provision of law required the parish priests to make entries in their books with regard to the birth, marriage, or death of their parishioners . . . The council required the parish priests to open books in which to record baptisms, marriages, and deaths . . . The state, the attention of which was called for the first time to the importance of the records established by the provisions of the council, gave evidence of its interest by issuing the royal order of March 21, 1749, according to which the prelates of the Kingdom were directed to require the evidence referred to be kept exclusively in the churches.\" (Commentaries, vol. 1, p. 262.) <br/><br/>This evidence being lacking, and the civil status of marriage being in litigation, it is evident that nothing can be taken for granted upon the point in issue. There is no law or reason which authorizes the granting of alimony to a person who claims to be a spouse in the same manner as to a person who conclusively establishes by legal proof that he or she is such spouse, and sues for divorce or separation. In this case the legal evidence raises a presumption of law; in the former there is no presumption, there is nothing but a mere allegation — a fact in issue — and a simple fact in issue must not be confounded with an established right recognized by a final judgment or based upon a legal presumption. The civil status of marriage being denied, and this civil status, from which the right to support is derived, being in issue, it is difficult to see how any effect can be given to such a claim until an authoritative declaration has been made as to the existence of the cause. It is evident that there is of necessity a substantial difference between the capacity of a person after the rendition of a final judgment in which that person is declared to be in possession of the status of marriage and his capacity prior to such time when nothing exists other than his suit or claim to be declared in possession of such status of marriage. Any other view would render useless all the legal effects which flow from the authority of res adjudicata. <br/><br/>Nor can such a theory be sustained under the Code of Civil Procedure now in force. It is true that an interlocutory order such as that rendered by the respondent judge in the present case is not appealable during the course of the trial, but only after a final judgment has been rendered therein; but it is none the less true that it can not be the intention of the law, when prohibiting an appeal against interlocutory orders, to give executory force to all kinds of interlocutory orders which the judge may see fit to make in the course of a trial, and still less when the effect would be to cause irreparable damage, such as that alleged by the petitioner in the present case, by reason of the insolvency of the person in whose favor the granting of alimony has been ordered, and which allegation has not been objected to or denied by the <em>Respondent</em>. It is indeed a wise rule of procedure which refuses to permit the interruption of a trial by means of incidental appeals; but, if the judge incidentally in the course of a trial proceeds without or in excess of his jurisdiction, this rule which prohibits an appeal does not leave the party aggrieved without remedy. The same Code of Civil Procedure establishes several means by which such excess may be prevented. <br/><br/>In this case the remedy of prohibition is invoked. (Art. 516 in relation with 226.) This remedy must be based upon a lack of jurisdiction or an excess in the exercise of jurisdiction in order that the judge may be prohibited from continuing the proceedings. This remedy having been established by the Code of Civil Procedure now in force, it is not allowable to apply the theories and principles concerning the lack of jurisdiction or an excess in its exercise which prevailed in the law of these Islands prior to the promulgation of that Code. We must of necessity apply the theories and principles which prevail in the law which has established the remedy, or the authorities, which, in the American law, establish the doctrine upon the subject, and more especially the views prevailing in the State of California, whose Code of Procedure is strictly in accord with the Code in these Islands as to the remedy in question, with respect to which it may be said that the California Code is its true legal precedent. <br/><br/>To this end and as an illustration of the case as to the propriety of the remedy by prohibition, we may cite a decision of the supreme court of California of July 9, 1890. (Havemeyer &amp; Co., <em>Petitioners</em>, v. the Superior Court, Judge Wallace, <em>Respondent</em>.) <br/><br/>This was a case of quo warranto brought by the attorney-general of the State against a California corporation, the American Sugar Refinery Company, for the cancellation of its charter, and in which case judgment was rendered on the 8th of January, 1890; an incident having arisen as to the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the property of the company pending the taking of an appeal or to proceed to distribute the same according to law in case an appeal should not be taken, inasmuch as the corporation had been dissolved and its corporate rights forfeited, the judge made an order appointing a receiver. The receiver attempted to take possession of the sugar refinery, which he found in the possession of Messrs. Havemeyer &amp; Co., who claimed to have purchased it in the month of March, 1889, and asserted that since that time they had been in full and complete possession as absolute owners in their own exclusive right. After several other incidental proceedings the judge made an order directing the sheriff to put the receiver in possession of the locus in quo. Havemeyer &amp; Co. then applied to the supreme court for a writ of prohibition, which was issued.  \"The question now remains,\" says the court in its decision,  \"whether the superior court had jurisdiction to make an order appointing the receiver and ordering him to take from the possession of the petitioners certain property, the petitioners not having been a party to the quo warranto proceedings and alleging a right of their own to the said property.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In disposing of this question the court holds that the judge was without jurisdiction to make this order, and continues:  \"We now come to the question as to the remedy. Prohibition arrests the proceedings of an inferior judicial tribunal or officer when such proceedings are without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal or officer, and the writ issues in all cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. We have shown that the superior court in appointing a receiver exceeded its jurisdiction, and there is no question that the petitioners are seriously injured by the enforcement of the order. If then they have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, they are clearly entitled to the benefit of the writ of prohibition to arrest the proceedings under the void order.\" The court, to fortify its decision, takes up and discusses various objections, such as the following: (1) That the petitioners might have bowed to the authority of the receiver, giving him possession, and then obtained leave from the court to sue him in ejectment; (2) that the order appointing the receiver was appealable, and that, therefore, the remedy for prohibition would not lie; (3) that before availing themselves of this remedy petitioners should show that an objection to the order in question had been overruled. With respect to the first point the court says:  \"It is true petitioners might have done this, but the remedy would have been neither speedy nor adequate. They had the right not merely to get their property back after a long and expensive litigation — they had a right to keep it. The wrong with which they were threatened when they applied for the writ and when the writ issued was the deprivation of the possession and the use of their property. To give the property up in the hope of being allowed by the superior court to sue for it and to recover it after years of litigation was neither an adequate nor speedy remedy. It would be as reasonable to say that an injunction should never issue to restrain a threatened injury because the injured party may always have his action for damages.\" As to the second point the court states:  \"There must not only be a right of appeal but the appeal must furnish an adequate remedy in order to prevent the issuance of the writ. A number of cases have been decided in this court in which writs of prohibition have been refused because there was a right of appeal, but in all of those cases the appeal afforded a complete and adequate remedy for the threatened excess of jurisdiction.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>With respect to the third point the court says that  \"the following propositions applicable to the case are fully supported by the decision in the case of the Mayor of London v. Cox, L. R., H. L., 278-280: (1) If a want of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the proceedings in the lower court, no plea or preliminary objection is necessary before suing out the writ of prohibition. (20 If the proceeding in the lower court is not on its face without the jurisdiction of such court, but is so in fact by reason of the existence of some matter not disclosed, such matter ought to be averred in some proper form in order to make the want of jurisdiction of the superior court to grant prohibition. it is only laches which may or may not be excused, according to circumstances. <br/><br/>\"Accordingly, we find that frequently a failure to plead in the lower court was excused for the reason that it appeared that the plea would have been rejected if made.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>By judgment of the 12th of December, 1891, the same supreme court in a similar proceeding against the superior court of San Francisco, Judge Wallace used the following language:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Prohibition lies in all cases where there have been proceedings ’without or in excess’ of jurisdiction, and there ’is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.’ Jurisdiction is usually defined as ’the power to hear and determine;’ but, of course, it is difficult to express in abstract terms a statement of the distinction between error in exercising jurisdiction and jurisdiction itself that can be readily applied to all cases as they may arise. The law endeavors to fix definitely everything that can in its nature be so fixed, so as to leave as little as possible to the judgment or caprice of those who administer it. But as many future events can not, in the nature of things, be foreseen and provided for, it follows necessarily that much must be left to the discretion of courts and other tribunals.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This doctrine was applied to the procedure of the judge who had taken action upon a void information presented by a grand jury which by reason of its defective organization was not regarded as a legally existing body, and the court decided  \"that the jury not being a legal body and the so-called indictment being void, the court below was without jurisdiction to try the accused upon such an indictment, hence the attempted action of the court was without and in excess of its jurisdiction.\" As to whether the petitioner had any other prompt, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the court said:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"If there be such remedy, it must be by appeal. But it would be a difficult proposition to maintain that a defendant in a criminal case, forced through all the stages of a trial for felony without any indictment against him, or, which is the same thing in effect, upon a void indictment, would have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, because, after conviction and judgment, and perhaps after suffering the ignominy of imprisonment in the state prison, he could have the illegal proceeding reversed on appeal . . . We are of opinion, therefore, that there is no jurisdiction in the respondent to proceed with the trial of petitioner; that the latter has no ’plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,’ and that prohibition is the proper remedy.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Mr. Justice Garmette added:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The case of Quimbo Appo v. People, 20 N. Y., 542, received an exhaustive consideration from the court of that State, and, after referring to many authorities upon the question as to when the writ of prohibition should issue, it said: ’These cases prove that the writ lies to prevent the exercise of any unauthorized power in a cause or proceeding of which the subordinate tribunal has jurisdiction, no less than when the entire cause is without the jurisdiction.’ And again: ’This shows that the writ was never governed by any narrow, technical rules, but was resorted to as a convenient mode of exercising a wholesome control over inferior tribunals. The scope of this remedy ought not, I think, to be abridged, as it is far better to prevent the exercise of unauthorized power than to be driven to the necessity of correcting the error after it is committed.’\" <br/><br/>In its decision of December 8, 1890, the same supreme court in a proceeding similar to that now before us, instituted, by J. M. McDowell against Aaron Bell, judge of the superior court of Shasta County, upon the ground that this judge in an incidental proceeding similar to that which now occupies our attention directed that certain property claimed by a third person be subjected to the satisfaction of a judgment rendered against the grantee, held as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"In this the respondent exceeded his jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of his court. His only power in the premises was to make an order authorizing the judgment creditor to institute an action in the proper court against the parties claiming the property for the recovery of the property and the subjection of the same to the satisfaction of the debt, and forbidding a transfer of the property until such action could be commenced and prosecuted to judgment.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This indicates what is meant by an act without or in excess of jurisdiction in accordance with the principles upon which article 226 of the present Code of Civil Procedure is based. <br/><br/>The court below had jurisdiction to try the divorce suit, but he was without jurisdiction to grant alimony when the right to claim alimony had not accrued in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code. This Code only grants the right to alimony to a wife. This status not appearing by a final judgment, the court is without jurisdiction to make any order in the matter. Therefore mandamus is the proper remedy upon the facts related. <br/><br/>It is not necessary to decide at this time if an exception could be made with respect to a case in which the fact of the marriage is admitted of record by the defendant. In the case before us this fact was denied. The motion and demurrer are overruled and the defendant is authorized to answer the complaint within twenty days from this date. <br/><br/>Torres, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The petition for the writ of prohibition presents a case in which the Court of First Instance of Manila in an action for divorce has, by an interlocutory order upon application of the alleged wife after a hearing had thereon, granted the alleged wife, the plaintiff in the suit, alimony pendente lite. The defendant bases his application for a writ of prohibition, staying and annulling the order granting the alimony, on the grounds that the Court of First Instance in granting alimony pendente lite has acted in excess of its jurisdiction; that the alleged wife, the plaintiff in the divorce suit, has no resources whatever, and that the judge not having required of her security for the return of the money to be received as alimony, in the event of the rendition of judgment against her upon the final trial the money will be lost to him, and that the remedy by appeal is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. A demurrer was presented to the application which has been overruled by this court. The reasons of the court for overruling are summarized as follows: (1) The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction in the matter of divorce; (2) in this suit the power to grant alimony depends exclusively upon the provisions of the Civil Code, and that this does not permit the granting of such alimony except in favor of a wife; and (3) that such status not having been established by a final judgment the court lacks jurisdiction to pass any judgment upon the matter of alimony. <br/><br/>I regard this decision as establishing an inequitable rule in cases of alimony, and also a practice in the granting of writs of prohibition not authorized by law. <br/><br/>The learned Chief of Justice in his opinion seems to have in view the practice prevailing in the ecclesiastical tribunals formerly existing here, but which have passed out with the Spanish domination. <br/><br/>These courts having ceased to exist, the practice peculiar to them has been abolished. <br/><br/>The jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts depended upon a canonical marriage, proof of which was jurisdictional and was the prerequisite to an action. Only one kind of proof was admissible — this was the evidence contained in the registers of the church. If this character of proof was not forthcoming and the marriage was disputed the party was sent to the civil tribunal to establish the marriage; the action would not be admitted otherwise. Again, alimony could not be granted in the ecclesiastical court, the court which had cognizance of the main suit, because the ecclesiastical decree produced no civil effects whatever; therefore, in order that it might be granted, the matter was remitted to the civil tribunals which had power to deal with the property of the parties, and this was usually done under the provisions of articles 1591-1599 of the Code of Civil Procedure formerly in force in these Islands. These provisions are for temporary maintenance and apply generally to all cases where the applicant is entitled to support under the law. <br/><br/>Actions for divorce were invariably brought in the ecclesiastical courts, but this was on account of the universal custom of the celebration of canonical marriages. The ecclesiastical courts, as stated, exercise jurisdiction only in cases of a canonical marriage. They had no jurisdiction in cases of civil marriage or any other form of marriage such as marriages under foreign laws. The civil tribunals had jurisdiction of divorce suits and suits for nullity of marriage in these cases, and not only had jurisdiction of the main suit but they were also given jurisdiction of the proceedings for alimony pendente lite. Articles 103 and 107 of the Civil Code, which vest this jurisdiction, read as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"(103) The civil tribunal shall take cognizance of the suits for nullity of marriages celebrated in conformity with the provisions of this chapter (regulating civil marriages) and shall adopt the measures indicated in article 68 (the article providing for alimony pendente lite), and shall give sentence definitely.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 107 is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The provisions of article 103 shall be applicable to suits for divorce and their incidents.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>From this it will be seen that the ecclesiastical courts and the civil tribunals admitted suits in their respective jurisdictions on different principles — the former only where the marriage was not contested or where the status of marriage had been established in a civil tribunal. The latter did not require proof of marriage as a prerequisite to the exercise of its jurisdiction; marriage was only one of the issues involved in the suit. The decrees of the ecclesiastical courts produced no civil effects whatever, and it was necessary to call to their aid the civil tribunals in order to deal with the property of a party. On the other hand, the civil tribunal might settle the whole dispute in one proceeding, they having the power both to adjudge and to enforce their decrees upon the property of the parties. A party in this tribunal would never have been remitted to any other proceeding to establish the civil status of the wife, nor to any other proceeding to enforce its decrees against the property. Consequently the civil tribunals having the full power to adjudge every matter in dispute between the parties after taking cognizance of the cause would retain it until its final termination and the fruits of the judgment had been secured. In the clear language of the statute, it has jurisdiction of divorce suits and its incidents and the granting of the alimony; the law in express terms gives it this jurisdiction. <br/><br/>While section 68 of the Civil Code gives alimony to the wife, the jurisdiction of the court can not be made to depend upon this article, nor can the word  \"wife\" in any manner be regarded as a word of limitation on the power to adjudicate alimony. <br/><br/>Nor do we apprehend that the Court of First Instance as now organized, with general jurisdiction and with its admitted power to hear divorce suits, can be circumscribed in its power by any such reasons as that the civil status of the wife is a prerequisite to its power to adjudicate the case. <br/><br/>If it is intended to be asserted in the decision that in order to obtain alimony it is necessary that the parties should resort to the special proceedings as provided in article 1591, a serious objection to such position is that it is probable these provisions of law are no longer in force. Our present Code of Civil Procedure contains a sweeping clause in the repeal of all other procedure. It reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"SEC. 795. All codes, statutes, acts, decrees, and orders or parts thereof heretofore promulgated, enacted, or in force in the Philippine Islands prescribed in the Procedure in Civil Actions or Special Proceedings in any court or tribunal are hereby repealed, and the procedure in all civil actions and special proceedings and all courts and tribunals shall hereafter be in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>However this may be, the courts organized under our present laws of procedure pursue their course in the exercise of jurisdiction in accordance with American laws. The Spanish system of procedure is scarcely recognized among its enactments. <br/><br/>In divorce suits, according to American practice, alimony is regarded as an incident to the suit and the granting of alimony as an auxiliary proceeding. (Encl Pl. and Prac., 408, alimony; 2 Am. and Eng. Encl. Law, 93.) Such a practice as dividing up the suit and trying the issues in the divorce suit in a separate and distinct action from the proceedings for alimony would not be tolerated in an American court. (Bennett v. Southard, 35 Cal., 691.) Nor would it be practicable to separate the two proceedings. Alimony being a provision for the wife pendente lite, if the granting of it was separated from the main suit its adjudication might not reach a final conclusion until long after the principal suit, in aid of which it is supposed to be granted, has been disposed of; besides, it would require a multiplicity of suits without any compensating benefit whatever. <br/><br/>The proper parties being duly before the court and the court having the power to hear and determine the matter at issue between them constitutes its jurisdiction. The Court of First Instance in this case clearly had the power to hear and determine all the issues involved in the main suit and in the application for alimony, and having the power to hear and determine these questions, in both of which marriage is an issue, it did not exceed its jurisdiction, and prohibition will not lie to correct any errors that may have been committed in the hearing. <br/><br/>If it be admitted that the court was not acting without or in excess of its jurisdiction the language of our statute authorizing prohibition seems too plain for controversy. Section 226 reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"When the complainant in an action pending in any Court of First Instance alleges that the proceedings of any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person where exercising functions judicial or ministerial were without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal, corporation, board, or person, and the court on trial shall find that the allegations of the complainant are true and that the plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, it shall render a judgment in favor of the complainant including an order commanding the defendant absolutely to desist or refrain from further proceeding in the action or matter specified therein.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In order for a party to avail himself of this remedy the inferior tribunal must be acting without or in excess of its jurisdiction, and in addition to this there must be no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <br/><br/>As we have attempted to show, the Court of First Instance had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues upon which the right to alimony depended, and whether the remedy by an appeal from an erroneous exercise of this jurisdiction is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy it is unnecessary to determine. It is the only remedy that has been provided, and if cases occur in which it does not afford adequate relief it is the fault of the legislative power and it rests with it to provide additional remedies. The case of Havemeyer v. Superior Court, 84 Cal, 327, is in no way in conflict with these views, but rather supports them. The same may be said of the other cases cited. <br/><br/>Let us now examine the nature of alimony pendente lite and the principles upon which it is granted. Article 68 of the Civil Code provides that after a petition for a nullity of marriage or for a divorce has been interposed and admitted certain provisions shall be adopted during the pendency of the suit, among which is a provision for the support of the wife and such children as do not remain under the power of the husband. This provision of law contemplates a separation of the consorts in every case. This character of suit is generally marked by obstinacy and bitterness. For here is found property and the offspring as the stake at issue. Passions engendered by resentment, pride, cupidity, and affection find scope in the action. <br/><br/>The husband and wife thus involved in litigation and their position as to the right and wrong of the matter being as yet unascertained, we find with reference to their resources the law has placed them in the following condition: The wife’s estate consists of her dowry, paraphernalia, and one-half of the conjugal community property. Her dowry is composed of the property and rights brought as such by her to the marriage at the time of contracting it and those which she acquires during the marriage by donation, inheritance, or legacy as total property. The dowry may have been obligatory, i.e., such as the law has required the parents to give to their legitimate daughter on marriage. Now, dowry, if it be an estimated dowry — that is, if the property of which it consists was appraised at the time of its constitution — is transferred in ownership to the husband, who only upon the dissolution of the marriage is pledged to return its value. Of this he has absolute control and power of disposition. <br/><br/>The ownership of the dowry not estimated is retained by the wife, but she can alienate, encumber, or mortgage it only with the license of the husband, who, in case of such litigation, is not likely to consent. Of this part of the dowry the husband is the administrator and usufructuary. <br/><br/>The paraphernalia is the property which the wife brings to the marriage, not included in the dowry and what she acquires after the constitution of the same, and which is not added to the dowry; of this the wife still retains the dominion as well as its management, unless she has delivered the same to the husband with the intent that he may administer it. This property she can not alienate, encumber, or mortgage without the like permission of her husband, and when it consists of available property, such as money or public stocks, or valuable personal property, the husband has the right to require that it be deposited or invested in such a way that the alienation of the same should be impossible without his consent. <br/><br/>With reference to the conjugal community property, which is the earnings or profits indiscriminately obtained by either of the consorts during the marriage and which belongs to the husband and wife share and share alike, when the marriage is dissolved she finds herself in no better position, for the husband is the administrator of his property and has the exclusive disposition of it. <br/><br/>So we find that the husband at the beginning of this litigation, in which a separation is contemplated, has all of his individual separate property brought to the marriage or acquired during the marriage by him with the absolute power of control and disposition; he is the administrator of the conjugal community property and has the power of its control and disposition; he is the owner, and has the control and disposition over the wife’s estimated dowry, and is administrator and usufructuary of the dowry not estimated; he has a veto power upon the right of the wife to alienate, encumber, or mortgage the dowry not estimated and the paraphernalia. The wife has been shorn of power over all of that which she possesses in her separate right as well as that held in her conjugal community right. <br/><br/>In this situation she turns in despair to the law and finds that it has done her scant justice by making provisions for her alimony. <br/><br/>But this court so construes the law as to substantially deprive her of this benefit. She asks for support while she carries on the litigation; she is told that she must institute an independent action to establish her status as a wife, and that this action must be prosecuted to final judgment. Upon her is thus imposed the additional burden of another suit, in which no provision has been made for alimony; and further, this second suit being commenced subsequent to the divorce suit and the judgment being alike appealable, according to the natural course of events, will probably not reach a final determination until the main suit has been settled; as a result alimony pendente lite is made impossible. <br/><br/>She is also met by another objection, which is that she is totally without resources and will be unable to return the amount of the alimony received from the husband in the event that she fails in the litigation unless she gives security for it. We have seen that the law absolutely prohibits her from encumbering, without the license of her husband, that part of her separate property which it has not taken from her and given to the husband. <br/><br/>The law thus mocks her in the helplessness in which it has placed her. She asks for bread, a stone is given her. <br/><br/>Conclusions leading to such inequitable results ought not to be readily adopted by a court of justice. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated I dissent from the opinion of the court. </div>'\n",

The defendants appeal from this judgment. <br/><br/>It appears that the deceased, Claudio Magligsay, disappeared from the place of his residence about the 8th of July, and that his body was found floating in an estero called Allañigan. <br/><br/>The conviction is sustained chiefly on the testimony of the defendants themselves. Santiago Bolar testifies that about 12 o’clock at night, in the month of July last, on returning toward his house after having made watch on his land, he accidentally met Claudio Magligsay, who was coming in an opposite direction; that the witness asked Claudio if he still had resentment and jealousy against him for having formerly been the lover of Baldomera Cabalse, and as a reply the deceased gave the witness a blow with a stick on the left shoulder, which caused the witness to fall to the ground; that upon getting up the defendant answered, giving the deceased a blow which struck him on the head. <br/><br/>Baldomera Cabalse states that some time ago Santiago Bolar asked for her hand; that there afterwards resulted intimate relations; that from these relations a child was born, and that afterwards Santiago withdrew from her his affections by reason of having fallen in love with another woman, and the witness entered into new relations with Claudio Magligsay, with whom she was to marry; that on the night of the killing Claudio left her house at a late hour. <br/><br/>Agapito Palos y Cortalos testified that the body of the deceased when found contained a wound in the breast and that the body was almost decapitated. <br/><br/>Jose Cabbadol y Torres, one of the defendants, states that two weeks before the crime occurred the defendant Santiago Bolar said to witness states that he had to kill Claudio Magligsay; the witness states that Baldomera Cabalse was the querida of Claudio and Santiago wished to renew his relations with the woman and that this was the cause of the enmity which Santiago bore against the deceased; that one night when the witness and Santiago Bolar were returning from watching their land, about 12 o’clock at night, the witness, being a little behind Santiago, saw that the latter met Claudio Magligsay, who was coming in the opposite direction, and that upon such meeting Claudio struck Santiago a blow with a stick, the latter falling to the ground; that Santiago immediately got up and in turn struck a like blow on the head of the deceased, who then took to his heels, and meeting the witness a short way off Claudio also struck him with the stick, whereupon, in self-defense, the witness stabbed Claudio, killing him; that afterwards the witness and Santiago took the body and placed it in a large basket and threw it into the river. <br/><br/>In weighing the testimony given by a defendant in a criminal case the same rules are observed as prevail in considering the testimony of other witnesses. That part which is consistent and generates belief will be accepted, and such parts as are inconsistent and produce an opposite effect may be rejected. <br/><br/>We discredit the statement made by the defendants that the deceased was the aggressor. There is an entire lack of probability that such should have been the case. This view is based upon a reasonable deduction from the evidence and by considering the previous statement made by Santiago Bolar to Jose Cabbadol that the deceased must be killed; the jealously and resentment of Santiago toward the deceased; the lack of any such feeling on the part of the deceased, so far as the record discloses; that the defendants were found at a late hour of the night without satisfactory explanation near the residence of Baldomera Cabalse, where the deceased was; that the body of the deceased was mutilated by the defendants, placed in a basket, and thrown into the river, showing strong feelings of hate and a purpose to conceal the crime not consistent with innocence; also the improbability that the deceased, who was unarmed and alone, should have provoked the difficulty and attacked the defendants. We think it more probable that the defendants, knowing that the deceased was in the house of Baldomera Cabalse, were lying in wait there, and that Santiago, with the aid of Jose Cabbadol, sought the occasion with a heart full of hatred to wreak bloddy vengeance upon the deceased. <br/><br/>Under the most favorable view that can be taken the defendants must be found guilty of homicide, punishable under article 404 of the Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstances existing of nocturnity as defined in paragraph 15 of article 10 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance will be reversed and judgment rendered against the defendants, Santiago Bolar and Jose Cabbadol, sentencing each of them to the penalty of reclusion temporal, punishable by imprisonment for the period of seventeen years four months and one day, with indemnification in the sum of 1,000 pesos, Mexican, with costs of suit adjudged against the defendants. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> Torres, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendants, Isidro Paddit, Marcelino Lozano, and Julian Serios, are accused of robbery en cuadrilla, resulting in homicide, in the following manner: The defendants on a night in November, 1900, in the town of San Nicolas, presented themselves at the house of Jacob de la Cruz, and after having tied him carried him to a place where the deceased had hidden a certain package, the property of Don Gregorio Mejia, which contained various articles and jewelry, and there committed the robbery and the killing of the deceased. The defendants were found guilty under the provisions of article 503, Penal Code, and the penalty of death was imposed upon them, from which judgment they have taken an appeal to this court. It was proven at the trial that on the night in question, on the occasion of the entering into the pueblo of the American Army, four persons armed with guns and bolos went to the house of the deceased, Jacob de la Cruz, and after binding his hands carried him off. Nicolasa Valdez, the widow of the deceased, testified that the three defendants were the persons who came to the house and commanded her husband to come downstairs. She lit a candle and went with her husband and recognized these three defendants; that she knew the three men because they lived in the same pueblo and barrio in which she was living; that the defendant Marcelino Lozano was a neighbor; that she had known him since her childhood; that in the month of November one Gregorio Mejia, on account of the confidence which he had in her husband, confided to his keeping a package containing the articles mentioned; that the defendants knew her husband was keeping the property of Gregorio Mejia because they saw the property when it was brought to his house; that she supposed they killed her husband in order that he might not report the matter to the authorities. That she know they were killing her husband after taking him away, because he called to her aloud just before they succeeded in killing him in a phrase used by the natives in bidding good-bye just before death; that about one hour and a half afterwards, on the return of her father, she told him what had happened, and they immediately went out and found the body of Jacob de la Cruz. He had five wounds on the breast and one on the back near the spinal column; it was east of the house that her husband was killed, near the place where the package was buried. She went to look for the package next day after her husband was killed and found that it was gone. <br/><br/>This witness was corroborated in her statements, as to the carrying off of her husband on the night in question, by Gregorio Mejia, Vicenta Valdez, and Lorenza Javellana, and as to the finding of the body and the character of the wounds which had been inflicted upon him and the disappearance of the articles mentioned. The defense offered the witnesses Joaquin Martinez; Eugenia Vicente, wife of Isidro Paddit; Juana Bibat and Ciriaca Serios, wife and daughter of Julian Serios, who testified that the three defendants were, during the whole month of November, in their respective houses; Paddit in the barrio of Santo Tomas, and Lozano and Serios in the same barrio in which the occurrence took place. We give no credence to the proof of alibi by these witnesses for the defendant. <br/><br/>If the charge had been murder (asesinato) the evidence would have been entirely sufficient to sustain the charge as qualified by alevosia, with the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, and the sentence of the court to the death penalty might have been sustained, but the charge is for robbery resulting in homicide. <br/><br/>After a careful consideration of the testimony we are inclined to believe that the offense of robbery has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. No witness saw the taking of the package by the defendants and none of the property has been found in their possession. The property was hidden two weeks before the occurrence; there was no evidence as to the manner in which it was hidden nor whether it remained at the place or was seen there at any time from the time it was placed there two weeks previous to the time of its disappearance. <br/><br/>By the provisions of section 29, General Orders, No. 58, a defendant may be found guilty of any offense the crime of which is necessarily included in the charge under the complaint and information. <br/><br/>The offense of homicide is included in the offense of robbery resulting in homicide, and we find the defendants guilty of homicide with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, which is punishable under article 404, with seventeen years and four months reclusion temporal in its medium degree. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is reversed and the defendants are each now sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of reclusion temporal in its medium degree, with indemnification of 1,000 pesos, Mexican, to the family of deceased, and costs of suit. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> Torres, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The decision of this court have followed this line of cases. (United States v. Paraiso and United States v. Roque, cases Nos. 91 and 895.) <br/><br/>In this case the Government cites three decisions of the supreme court of Spain, dated the 24th of November, 1882, the 24th of January, 1883, and the 31st of January, 1884, in which the doctrine is laid down that the person who signs a receipt on a bill of exchange with the name of another, he not being the lawful owner thereof, and signs the name of the true holder of the bill, is guilty of the falsification of a mercantile document, because of having falsely caused it to appear on the face of the document that some one who did not really sign it was a party thereto; that is to say, in the present case Francisco Buenaventura made it appear by the indorsement that the real P. San Buenaventura had indorsed the check, the fact being that he did not do so. <br/><br/>It is difficult to imagine how a case could arise in which one person’s signature is substituted for another, whether simulated or not, without it being made to appear by the person making the substitution that some person who did not actually sign had done so. Neither is it easy to understand how a case could arise which would fall within paragraph 1 of article 300 of the Code without at the same time falling within paragraph 2 of the same article. Upon this theory, in all those decisions in which the court held that there was no falsification because there was no attempt to imitate, counterfeit, or simulate the true signature, the court omitted to consider, as in the three judgments cited, that the person accepting the signature had feigned the participation of a person who did not actually participate. <br/><br/>It may, perhaps, be attempted to rest the distinction upon the fact that in the last three judgments and some others which might be cited the documents referred to are commercial, whereas in the former judgments, as well as in some others rendered in recent years which might also be cited, the questions concern private documents. But the fact remains that this differentiation must fall to the ground upon an examination of another judgment rendered July 1, 1890. This was a case of a clerk in a commercial firm who had presented a check to a bank for collection, having signed his principal’s name and indorsed the check  \"Received,\" signed by himself with the name of another person. The check was not paid on presentation by reason of the fact that the signature appended thereto was not recognized as authentic. <br/><br/>The criminal branch of the court of Havana held that these facts constituted the crime of frustrated estafa, but the Government took the case up on cassation for infraction of law, assigning as error the failure to hold that these facts constituted the crime of falsification, urging that this offense consists not only in counterfeiting the handwriting or signature of another but also in simulating the participation in an act of a person who did not so participate, or in perverting the truth in a narration of facts. Nevertheless the supreme court held that the court of Havana had not erred in its determination as to the crime resulting from the facts upon which the appeal was based, holding that the facts found by the judgment, to the effect that the defendant signed a check and signed the receipt with another’s name but without counterfeiting the handwriting, signature, or rubric of the supposed signer, the case did not constitute any one of the falsifications covered by article 310 of the Penal Code of Cuba and Porto Rico (art. 300 of the Philippine Penal Code), but constituted an integral part of the deceit which, together with the intent to defraud, constituted the essence of the crime of estafa; that orders for payment known as mercantile documents in the Code of Commerce in force acquire their validity from the signature of the person who issues them, and when the supposititious signature has been written in such a way that the difference between the true and supposititious signature is observed as soon as the check is presented for payment, and the difference is such as to avoid all possibility of error on the part of the person called upon to pay the check, it simply shows an intention on the part of the criminal to commit the crime of estafa. <br/><br/>Therefore the judgment below, by which the defendant was condemned to eight years and one day of prision mayor and to pay a fine of 5,000 pesetas, is reversed, and the defendant is acquitted of the charge of falsification. The crime committed is that of estafa. <br/><br/>Cooper, Willard, Smith, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Francisco Buenaventura was accused of the crime of the falsification of a mercantile check on the Hongkong-Shanghai Banking Corporation in favor of P. S. Buenaventura, a copy of which appears on folio 3. He had made the signature of the latter to appear on the indorsement in favor of Segundo Madera, and after two subsequent indorsements the check was presented and paid by the bank. A prosecution was commenced and the defendant, a young man 19 years of age, having been called upon to plead to the charge, plead guilty, and stated that he had signed the check with the name of P. S. Buenaventura, and that he had collected the amount thereof, because his name was Francisco San Buenaventura, and as on other occasions his American employers had issued checks to him in which the first letter of his Christian name was confused with the letter  \"P,\" and as the rest of his surname is exactly the same as that which appears on the check, he indorsed the same in the belief that it was his and collected it in good faith. <br/><br/>These facts do not constitute a misdemeanor as contended by the defense, but the crime of falsification of a mercantile document, defined and punished by article 301, in connection with article 300, paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Penal Code. The fact that the defendant wrote an indorsement with the letters  \"P. Sn.\" and the surname  \"Buenaventura\" on a check issued to the latter, simulating the signature of the owner of the check and transferring it to a third person, from whom he received its value, $25, it follows that the crime of falsification has been committed, because in the operation of indorsement he simulated the participation of P. S. Buenaventura, and perverted the truth in the narration of the facts, lucri causa, and with the malicious intent to defraud the person from whom he received the value of the check. <br/><br/>It is of no importance that in the substitution of the signature of P. Sn. Buenaventura in the indorsement of the check to Segundo Madera no attempt was made to imitate the handwriting and signature of the real owner of the check. This requisite of imitation with respect to the crime of forgery by substitution of signature is only applicable when the falsification is of a private document, such as the simulation of a letter, duebill, or receipt. With respect to public, official, or mercantile documents the crime of falsification is present whenever any one of the offenses enumerated in article 300 of the Penal Code is committed, and even a case falling under paragraph 1 of that article, where no attempt has been made to imitate the handwriting and signature of the person whose signature has been substituted. <br/><br/>It is a general principle, established by articles 301 and 304 of the Penal Code, that a private individual who, in a public or official document or in a mercantile document or in a private document, commits any of the falsifications enumerated in article 300 shall suffer the penalties respectively prescribed in each one of these articles, according to whether the falsified document is public or mercantile or merely private. It is to be observed, however, that with respect to private documents the falsification of the latter can only be brought within one of the first six paragraphs of article 300, inasmuch as the last two paragraphs refer to the falsification of public instruments. <br/><br/>There is an essential difference between the falsification of a public or mercantile document and that of a private document. In order that the latter be punishable as a crime it is an indispensable condition that a third person be prejudiced thereby or that the crime was committed with the intent to cause such prejudice. With respect to the falsification of public documents, it is a matter of indifference whether it has or has not caused damage to a third person by reason of the fact that the falsification of public documents is controlled by other principles distinct from those applicable to private documents. In the latter the prejudice or damage suffered by a third person is the principal element. With respect to the public documents it is the public interest which it is principally sought to protect, and, with respect to mercantile document of June 3, 1873, of the supreme court of Spain.) <br/><br/>As long as the present Penal Code is in force it is indispensable, for a proper application of its principles, to follow the doctrine established by the decisions of the supreme court of Spain. <br/><br/>This high tribunal, applying the general principle referred to, has laid down the proposition which has now the force of law, that the crime of falsification of documents is committed when any one of the falsifications narrated in article 300 of the Penal Code, equivalent to article 314 of the Spanish Code, is committed. With respect to a mercantile document, the falsification of which exists in the substitution of the signature of its lawful owner, the crime of falsification exists even if no attempt has been made to imitate the handwriting, signature, or rubric of the true owner of the document. (Judgments of November 24, 1882; January 24, 1883; January 31, 1884; April 21, 1897.) <br/><br/>As an exception to this rule the court has held that the mere simulation of the receipt, letter, or duebill, or of any private document made or committed for the purpose of estafa, does not constitute the crime of falsification of a private document unless an attempt is made to imitate the handwriting and signature of the person by whom such documents purport to be made. (Judgments of October 18, 1873; January 15, 1874; December 27, 1882; April 15, 1885; May 20, 1886.) <br/><br/>The guilt of the defendant appears from his own spontaneous and express confession of what he did for the purpose of consummating the crime. It can not be considered that he acted in good faith, as his own statements demonstrate that by availing himself of similarity which he alleges — and which has not been proven — between the letters  \"P\" and  \"F\" and the identity of his surname with that of the owner of the check, he substituted the signature of the latter with the malicious intent to convert to his own use the amount of the check, to the prejudice of the person paying him its value, he well knowing that he had no right to collect the same. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime no mitigating or aggravating circumstance appears to be present, and certainly not that set up by the defense with respect to the age of the defendant, because the latter is over 18 years of age. He stated himself (p. 4) that he was 19. <br/><br/>In view of these considerations I am of the opinion that the judgment below by which the defendant was sentenced to eight years and one day of presidio mayor and to pay a fine of 5,000 pesetas should be affirmed with the costs of both instances to the defendant, although the ruling of the court below as to subsidiary imprisonment should be omitted, in view of the character of the penalty imposed and in accordance with article 51 of the Penal Code. </div>'\n",

Upon this the two girls left the closet for the purpose of going back to the house, but before they succeeded in this the defendants approached them, Manuel seizing Manuela and Jose seizing Felicisima. They embraced the girls and tried to throw them on the ground, with the intent to rape them. Notwithstanding their forcible efforts to do so they did not succeed in carrying out their purpose, owing to the resistance of the girls and their screams for help, which attracted the attention of their parents. Manuela retained in her hand a piece of her aggressor’s shirt as a result of the struggle. The girl’s parents were unable to catch the accused, as they made their escape before the parents reached the spot. <br/><br/>The facts related constitute the double crime of attempted rape. The accused, by the mere fact of having embraced the complaining witnesses and struggling with them and endeavoring to lay them or throw them on the ground, with the unquestionable intent of raping them, evidently commenced the execution of the crime of rape by exterior acts, and if they did not succeed in consummating the crime or performing the other acts necessary for its complete realization, it was not due to any voluntary withdrawal, but to the resistance of the victims, and the fact that their parents, attracted by their cries, came to their assistance. It follows, therefore, that the crime committed is that defined and punished by article 438, in connection with articles 3 and 66 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Although the defendants plead not guilty to the charge, the record discloses sufficient evidence for the prosecution to conclusively establish their guilt, as authors respectively of these attempted rapes, notwithstanding the denials and exculpative allegations of the defendants. <br/><br/>The testimony of the girls and that of their parents and that of several other witnesses, some of whom heard the screams and others observed from a distance the struggle between the complaining witnesses and the defendants and who say the latter ran away upon the approach of the girls’ parents; the piece of Manuel’s shirt which, as a result of the struggle, was left in Manuela’s hand; the two letters written in the native dialect, by the accused to each one of the complaining witnesses, respectively, some days after the event, in which, confessing their guilt, they asked pardon, and begged that the girls themselves impose the punishment upon them, and the statements made by Manuel Banzon in his sworn testimony, in which he relates the occurrence as having a different character, all tend to prove the facts upon which the complaint is based and to show that there was not a simple quarrel, as they allege by their unsupported statements. This conclusion is further supported by the other circumstances connected with the commission of the crime. <br/><br/>No aggravating circumstance was present in the commission of the offense, but the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code should be applied, in view of the character of the crimes prosecuted, and the personal conditions of the defendants and of the complaining witnesses. Therefore, each one of them must be condemned to the minimum degree of the penalty assigned by law. <br/><br/>We are, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed, and each one of the defendants convicted and sentenced to one year and six months of prision correccional, and to pay, each one, a half of the costs, they being also condemned to the accessory penalties established by article 61 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The offense with which the defendant was charged and of which he has been convicted is that defined in section 14 of Act No. 292 of the United States Philippine Commission, which is as follows:  \"Any person who shall have taken any oath before any military officer of the Army of the United States, or before any officer under the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands, whether such official so administering the oath was specially authorized by law so to do or not, in which oath the affiant in substance engaged to recognize or accept the supreme authority of the United States of America in these Islands or to maintain true faith and allegiance thereto or to obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by its duly constituted authorities and who shall, after the passage of this act, violate the terms and provisions of such oath or any of such terms or provisions, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or both.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant is a former insurgent officer and is entitled to the benefit of the proclamation of amnesty if the offense is one of those to which the proclamation applies. Assuming, for the purposes of the present motion, that the defendant is guilty of the offense, there is no evidence in the record showing that it was committed pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities, or that it grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities, or that it resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves. If it is covered by the amnesty it must be because it is embraced within the words employed in the proclamation to designate the first class of offenses amnestied, namely,  \"offenses of treason and sedition.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>If these words are to be given a construction in accordance with their strict technical signification, there will be some difficulty in holding that they include the offense in question. Treason is defined in section 1 of Act No. 292 to consist in levying war against the United States or the Government of the Philippine Islands, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the Philippine Islands or elsewhere. Sedition is defined in section 5 of the same act as the rising publicly and tumultuously in order to obtain by force or outside of legal methods certain enumerated objects of a political character. A violation of an oath containing the comprehensive engagements of that in question may be committed without by the same act committing either the crime of treason or that of sedition as thus defined, as, for example, in the case of a conspiracy to commit these crimes or to commit the crime of insurrection. (Act No. 292, secs. 3,4,7.) And, conversely, the crime of treason or that of sedition may be committed, without a violation of the oath of allegiance when it is committed, as it, of course, may be, by a person who has never taken such oath. The act, therefore, by which the offense of violation of oaths of allegiance, as defined in section 14 of Act No. 292, is committed, is not necessarily identical, although it may be in particular cases, with that by which the technical crime of treason or that of sedition is committed. And in all cases the offense of violation of an oath of allegiance involves, in a sense, an element, namely, the breaking of an express promise, which may not be present in treason or sedition. <br/><br/>In the present case the act by which the defendant is found by the court below to have violated the oath was that of denying to an officer of the United States Army the existence of certain rifles, which had been concealed by his orders at the time of his surrender in April, 1901, and of the existence and whereabouts of which he was cognizant at the time of the denial. If this act was a violation of the oath, which upon the evidence in the case may be doubtful, it was probably also an act of treason, as being an act of adhering to the enemies of the United States, giving them aid and comfort, and if the element of breach of promise is to be regarded as merely an incidental circumstance forming no part of the essence of the crime of violation of oaths of allegiance, the offense in this particular case might, perhaps, be held to be covered by the amnesty as being, in substance, treason though prosecuted under another name. <br/><br/>We prefer, however, to base our decision upon a broader ground, and one which will cover all cases of prosecution for the offense of violation of oaths of allegiance. <br/><br/>There are a variety of offenses in the criminal codes of all countries which are not directed primarily against individuals, but rather against the existence of the state, the authority of the government or the general public tranquility. All or nearly all of the offenses created and defined in Act No. 292 are distinctly of this character. Among them are treason properly so called (section 1), misprision of treason (section 2), insurrection (section 3), conspiracy to commit treason or insurrection (section 4), sedition properly so called (section 5 and 6), conspiracy to commit sedition (section 7), seditious words and libels (section 8), the formation of secret political societies (section 9), and finally the offense in question (section 14). The line of distinction between some of these offenses is often difficult to draw. They are all closely related and may all be embraced under the general description of offenses of a treasonable and seditious nature. When the framer of the proclamation used the words  \"treason and sedition\" to describe the purely political offenses covered by the amnesty, we think it was his intention, without specially enumerating the political offenses defined in Act No. 292, to include them all under those two general heads. <br/><br/>Treason, in its more general sense, is the  \"violation by a subject of his allegiance to his sovereign or liege lord, or to the supreme authority of the state.\" (Century Dictionary.) Sedition, in its more general sense, is  \"the raising of commotions or disturbances in the state.\" (Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, title  \"Sedition.\") Technical terms of the law when used in a statute are ordinarily to be given their technical signification. But in construing an executive act of the character of this proclamation, as in construing a remedial statute, a court is justified in applying a more liberal rule of construction in order to effectuate, if possible, the beneficent purpose intended. Certainly a limitation of the words in question to their literal and technical signification would utterly defeat the unmistakable general object of the amnesty. Upon such a construction treason, the highest of all political crimes, a crime which may be punished by death under section 1 of Act No. 292, would be included in the amnesty, while insurrection, which is a crime of precisely the same nature and differs from it solely in being inferior in degree and punishable by fine and imprisonment only, would be excluded. A construction leading to such manifest inconsistencies could be accepted only when the language admitted of no other. We think the construction suggested as the true one though somewhat less restricted than the precise legal signification of the terms  \"treason\" and  \"sedition\" might warrant, may be adopted without doing violence to the language of the proclamation, and there is no room for doubt in our minds that by adopting that construction we carry out the real intention of the President. <br/><br/>We hold, therefore, that the offense of violation of oaths of allegiance, being one of the political offenses defined in Act No. 292, is included in the general words  \"treason and sedition,\" as used in the proclamation. The defendant is entitled to the benefits of the proclamation, and upon filing in this court the prescribed oath the cause will be returned to the court below with directions that he be discharged.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The evidence produced by the defendant to prove an alibi is not sufficient to overcome the positive testimony of two persons who identified him as the author of the assault in question. The judgment can not, therefore, be reversed on that ground. <br/><br/>Gregorio de Leon, the person attacked, was so seriously injured that he was taken to a hospital. While there, on the 24th day of August, eight days after the injury was inflicted, he signed, in the presence of the defendant, apparently, a written statement as to the occurrence. He recovered from his injuries, and at the time of the trial was in the provinces. <br/><br/>This statement was formally offered in evidence at the trial below. No objection was made thereto by the defendant or his counsel, and it was admitted. In this court the lawyer for the appellant claims that this statement should not have been received. This presents the only serious question in the case. The written declaration was doubtless inadmissible, but the defendant did not object to its reception. Why he did not the record does not show. In certain respects the statement contradicted the testimony of the other eyewitness who had already given his evidence at the time this declaration was offered. If Gregorio had been called to testify in court he might have explained these contradictions and in other respects made the Government’s case stronger than the statement made it. The lawyer who represents the defendant here did so below. Considerations such as these may have induced him to refrain from objecting. But whatever his reasons were, we can not hold that he had a right to remain silent — submit the case on this short statement of the injured person; have the chance of an acquittal by reason of its defects, and when the judgment went against him say in this court, for the first time, that the statement should not have been received. When it was offered he should have objected to it. From his failure to do so may be presumed his consent that it might be received. It is now too late to withdraw that consent. The judgment is confirmed with costs of this instance against the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It is a fact proven in this case that at about 11 a.m. on the 6th day of July, 1900, and for reasons which do not sufficiently appear, an armed conflict broke out between Marcos Bautista and his son, Gregorio Bautista, 20 years of age, on the one hand, at Antonio Yacat, Bautista;s brother-in-law, Eugenio Yacat, Cristino Yacat, Macario Mangilit, and Pedro Lising, on the other hand, at a place called Guyonguyong, near the town of Cabiao, the result of the fray being that Marcos received eight wounds, some serious and others mortal, in consequence of which he was left dead on the scene of the fight. Gregorio, Macario, and Cristino were also wounded more or less seriously. <br/><br/>The violent death of Marcos Bautista, which is charged in the information filed by the fiscal as murder, is fully proven in the record. The facts constitute the crime of homicide in a confused and tumultuous affray, and the case falls within article 405 of the Penal Code. Not only does the record fail to disclose which of the five men with whom the deceased and his son, Gregorio, fought was the one who killed Marcos, but it also fails to disclose which of them inflicted upon him the wounds. As all his five adversaries, Antonio Yacat, Eugenio Yacat, Cristino Yacat, Macario Mangilit, and Pedro Lising, during the conflict in which Marcos Bautista received his eight wounds, at least inflicted upon the said Bautista more or less serious personal violence, it is unquestionable that the homicide prosecuted occurred in a confused and tumultuous affray, and that the five defendants are responsible for the killing. Of these five defendants four were arrested and prosecuted and the fifth is absent. <br/><br/>The four defendants before the court, Antonio Yacat, Eugenio Yacat, Cristino Yacat, and Macario Mangilit, plead not guilty. From their self-contradictory testimony it may be inferred that all of them, together with the absentee, Pedro Lising, took part in the fight with the Bautistas, father and son. Their respective exculpative allegations can not, however, be admitted, as the same were not supported by the evidence. Nor can it be declared as a fact that they were attacked by the deceased Marcos and his son Gregorio, because, if their statement that they were at that time unarmed were true, they have failed to give any explanation of how it is that Marcos received eight wounds before he was killed, and that Gregorio was also wounded. <br/><br/>The record does not show that the defendants, acting on agreement or impelled by the sole purpose of killing Marcos, simultaneously attacked the latter without there having been a fight. The wounds of Macario Mangilit and Cristino Yacat show that there was a fight, but it is not possible to determine which of the contending parties provoked or commenced the quarrel. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding the testimony of Gregorio Bautista, it does not appear which of the five adversaries of his father, Marcos, was the one who killed the latter, nor which of them inflicted the serious wounds upon him, as Gregorio was unable to designate them. From the testimony for the prosecution it is to be inferred that the five adversaries of Marcos and his son, Gregorio, at least committed violence upon the person of the deceased. <br/><br/>From these statements it necessarily follows that the crime of murder has not been committed, because none of the qualifying circumstances referred to by article 403 of the Code were present in the killing by violence of Marcos Bautista. The killing occurred in such a manner as to fall within the provisions of article 405 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime no generic mitigating or aggravating circumstances can be considered. The guilt of the defendant Antonio Yacat appears to be aggravated by his relationship with the deceased, who was his brother-in-law by marriage with his sister, Tiburcia Yacat. Upon this ground, the reasons which led him to make this attack upon the life of his brother-in-law and leave his sister a widow, not having been proven, circumstance No. 1 of article 10 of the Code must be applied as aggravating his culpability. <br/><br/>If the judgment of acquittal against which the prosecuting attorney appealed is unsustainable, this can not be said of the contention of the counsel for the Government. If the crime of homicide is included in that of murder because homicide qualified by certain specific circumstances constitutes murder, it is unquestionable that upon an information for murder the courts can convict the defendants, as in this case, of the crime of homicide, under section 29 of General Orders, No. 58. It is not necessary that a new information be filed charging the latter offense. <br/><br/>It is true that the record contains no data upon which Eduardo Llanera can be held responsible as an accessory to the homicide in question. It is, however, unquestionable that Pedro Ureta, who was the local president of the town of Cabiao at the time the crime was committed, has incurred criminal liability. Abusing his public office, he refused to prosecute the crime of homicide and those guilty thereof, and thus made it possible for them to escape, as the defendant Pedro Lising did in fact. This fact is sufficiently demonstrated in the record, and he has been unable to explain his conduct in refusing to make an investigation of this serious occurrence, of which complaint was made to him, and consequently he should suffer a penalty two degrees inferior to that designated by paragraph 2 of article 405 of the Code, by virtue of article 68 thereof. <br/><br/>With respect to the motion of the counsel for the defendants that the case be dismissed on the ground that his clients are entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902, in view of the fact that these defendants did not take part in any way in the late insurrection to which the amnesty refers, and of the further fact that the record does not disclose sufficient evidence that the homicide in question was the result of a political hatred or of political dissensions between Filipinos, we are of the opinion that the application for amnesty can not be granted. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated, therefore, the motion for the dismissal of the case and the application of the amnesty proclamation of July 4 in favor of the defendant is hereby overruled. The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the offense being classified as homicide in a confused and tumultuous affray, the defendant Antonio Yacat is convicted and sentenced to the penalty of five years of correctional imprisonment, and the other three, Eugenio Yacat, Cristino Yacat, and Macario Mangilit, to the penalty of four years, each one, of correctional imprisonment, with the accessories of article 61, and to the payment, jointly or severally, of 1,500 Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of the deceased, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one year, and to the payment each of one-seventh part of the costs of both instances, they to be given allowance for one-half of the time they have been held as detention prisoners. The accessory, Pedro Ureta, is convicted and condemned to three months of arresto mayor, the accessories of article 61 of the Code above mentioned, and with subsidiary liability for the payment of the said indemnification in case of the insolvency of the authors of the crime, and, in case of his failure to pay the same, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one month, and to pay one-seventh part of the costs of both instances. Eduardo Llanera is acquitted, by reason of the lack of proof of his guilt, with one-seventh part of the costs de oficio, no decision being made for the present with respect to the absentee, Pedro Lising, and without prejudice to the criminal action which may be brought for the wounding of Gregorio Bautista, Macario Mangilit, and Cristino Yacat.

It can not be doubted that Marcos Bautista was killed by the defendants, or some of them, and not by his son. It is also clear that the wounds received by some of the defendants were inflicted by Marcos and Gregorio, and not by any of the defendants. <br/><br/>All of the defendants were engaged in an unlawful attack upon the two Bautistas which resulted in the death of Marcos, caused by one or more of them, this, in my opinion, making them guilty of homicide. Such a conflict between two well-defined bands does not constitute a confused and tumultuous affray mentioned in article 405. The four defendants engaged in the conflict should therefore be punished for the crime of homicide, defined in article 404. </div>'\n",

The parties stipulated in writing, under date of September 17 following, that the appellee should be allowed to file his brief in reply to the brief of the appellant, which brief, with the bill of exceptions and assignment of errors, had been duly served upon him. A motion was subsequently made by counsel for the appellee for the dismissal of the bill of exceptions brought up by the appellant, on the ground, first, that neither the said appellee nor his attorneys had been notified of the motion of the appellant in the Court of First Instance for a new trial under article 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure; second, that the said motion was decided by the judge below without the knowledge or presence of the appellee; third, that the said bill of exceptions does not show that the appellant has taken any exceptions in the course of the trial in the court below; and fourth, that neither the appellee nor his attorney had received notice of the presentation to the judge of the said bill of exceptions, or of the allowance of the same, and that therefore the appellee had no opportunity to make objections or offer amendments thereto, and that the same is incomplete and incorrect. <br/><br/>On page 8 of the bill of exceptions it appears that the defendant made a motion for a new trial, upon the grounds therein stated, which motion was overruled, and that he then presented to the judge the corresponding bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>If no notice of the motion which was overruled by the court below was served upon the plaintiff, no prejudice has been suffered by him, and for this reason the judge considered it proper to deny the motion without service of notice upon the adverse party, in accordance with the provisions of section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>The bill of exceptions was presented in due time and allowed by the judge. The appellee has not stated in what the bill is deficient or why the said bill is not complete or correct, or, if it was incomplete or incorrect, what prejudice has been occasioned him thereby.

His petition states:  \"I base my exception upon the fact that our demurrer was overruled.\" Under article 142 an exception to the order overruling the demurrer should have been taken  \"forthwith\" upon receiving notice thereof.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Ciriaco Baluyut, Felipe Duban, Camilo Angeles, and Cenon Patdu were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga with having gradually and furtively made away with three gold buttons, two silver ones, a few razors, a watch, an umbrella, a ring, and a general assortment of more or less useful wearing apparel. The complaint neglects to state who owned the property abstracted, but for the purposes of this case it will be assumed that it did not belong to the accused. <br/><br/>To enable the fiscal to utilize them as witnesses for the State the charge was dismissed on the trial as to all the defendants except Ciriaco Baluyut, who was found guilty of having stolen from the house in which he was employed as cook one razor of the value of $2.70. In the opinion of the trial court this disregard of the property rights of his master constituted the crime of domestic theft, and Baluyut was therefore sentenced to one year and a day of presidio correccional, and the usual accessories. <br/><br/>From the judgment Baluyut appealed to this court, and the only question raised by the record is the sufficiency and competency of the evidence on which his conviction was secured. <br/><br/>The Attorney-General recommends that the judgment of conviction be reversed, and we are of the opinion that his recommendation is well founded. The only evidence against the defendant is his own confession and the uncorroborated testimony of his codefendant, Camilo Angeles. Unfortunately the confession seems to have been made under such circumstances as to raise the presumption that it was induced by fear of physical violence, and that it was not of such a free and voluntary character as to give it weight and value as competent evidence. Baluyut and Angeles having been arrested on the charge, they were confined together and examined touching the misappropriation of the property in question. Both at first denied having any guilty knowledge of the matter, and persisted in their denials until Camilo Angeles, having been beaten and buffeted by Epifanio Carreon, finally admitted that he had received the razor from Baluyut in satisfaction of a debt. Baluyut then admitted that he had given the razor to Angeles. That Angeles was beaten is not denied by the prosecution, although he himself testifies that his incriminating statement was  \"spontaneous.\" Inasmuch as the prosecution carefully refrained, however, from asking him if he had been struck before making it, and declined to examine Goodale, Carreon, or Reyes on the subject at all, although they were witnesses for the prosecution and present at the time of the alleged beating, it is reasonably safe to assume that any spontaneity on the part of Angeles was accomplished by the strenuous measures described by defendant and his witness, Gutchillan. <br/><br/>No physical violence appears to have been visited upon Baluyut himself, yet, for all that, his confession made under the circumstances set out in the record must be excluded from consideration by the court for the lack of that free and voluntary character which would otherwise give it value as evidence. The physical violence to his codefendant, inflicted within his hearing, and almost in his immediate presence, to force a damaging admission, was as much an intimidation of the appellant, as much a warning to him of what he might expect under like circumstances, as if he had been openly threatened with similar ill treatment should he further persist in his denials of guilt. That confession may have any weight whatever with courts of justice, as legal proof, it is absolutely necessary that they should be freely and voluntarily made. If they are brought about by menace, threat, or intimidation or by a promise of reward or even of leniency they are stripped of the only element which makes them valuable to courts in determining the truth. With this confession out of the way the only evidence remaining against the defendant is the testimony of Angeles to the effect that Baluyut sold him the razor. The testimony of this witness standing alone and uncorroborated by other competent evidence does not convince the court of the guilt of the accused to a moral certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt. <br/><br/>The testimony of this witness is a substantial repetition of the statement obtained from him as the result of physical violence and force. It is impeached by the witness Batac, who testifies that Angeles informed him before the arrest that an American had given him (Angeles) the razor to sell. It is weakened by the fact that the prosecution failed to call Eulalio Razon or Pedro to corroborate Angeles’s statement that the razor had been given to him by Baluyut in their presence. It is unreliable because of the character of the witness, who is shown by the evidence to have stolen the cochero’s watch, which he only returned after being threatened with prosecution for the theft by Mr. Goodale. <br/><br/>For these reasons the unsupported evidence of his codefendant is not sufficient to warrant a conviction of the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court must therefore be reversed, and the defendant acquitted of the charge, with costs de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The appellant based his motion to amend the bill of exceptions on two grounds. The first one was that he had made a motion for a new trial in the court below; that this court under article 497, 3, had therefore a right to review the evidence, and that for such a review it was necessary to amend the bill of exceptions by adding thereto the evidence omitted. After the judgment was entered in the court below the defendant presented a bill of exceptions which contained the pleadings, decision, and judgment and certain allegations of fact and law. It concluded as follows:  \"Therefore the defendants pray the court that its judgment be amended, and that the defendants go hence without day, or else that this bill of exceptions be sent to the Supreme Court for its decision thereon.\" The judge, adding some statements of his own to it, signed this bill of exceptions and a copy thereof has been sent here. The claim of the appellant is that the aforesaid prayer found in the bill of exceptions was in effect a motion for a new trial. We can not agree to this contention. It is evident that the parties below did not so treat it. The judge made no order granting or denying it. It was simply a part, improperly so, of the bill of exceptions and we can not consider it as a motion for a new trial under article 145. The appellant is therefore not entitled to have the evidence brought here for the purpose of enabling us to review it. <br/><br/>The second ground on which the appellant bases his motion is that the bill of exceptions should be amended in the respect that the judge should certify as a part thereof that the cane in question belonged to Jose de Luna before it belonged to the plaintiff. At the trial the defendant offered certain evidence tending as he claimed to show that certain cane once belonging to Jose de Luna had been burned. The court rejected this evidence, to which the defendant excepted. This exception properly appears in the bill of exceptions. But the appellant says that this exception will be valueless to him unless the bill of exceptions shows, and he claims this to be a fact, that this cane so burned passed to the plaintiff from Jose de Luna, and having been burned could not have been converted by the defendants. <br/><br/>A decision of this motion does not involve a consideration of article 499. That article has been construed in the case of Gonzaga v. Norris, August 26, 1902, with which decision we are content. The question here is: Can the appellant have the bill of exceptions amended in the particular named under the last clause of article 500? That clause reads as follows: \". . . nor shall such dismissal be granted whereby an amendment to the bill of exceptions, which is hereby declared to be lawful and allowable, and imperfections or omissions of necessary and proper allegations, could be corrected from the record in the case.\" The bill of exceptions should contain not only the exceptions taken, but enough of the evidence to show the bearing of the rulings . . . excepted to.\" (Art. 143.) The judge should  \"restate the facts if need be, and the exceptions so that . . . their relevancy shall be made clear.\" (Art. 143.) The bill of exceptions in this case does not do that. It does not show that the fact that Jose de Luna at one time owned this cane is at all relevant to the case. The defendant claims that its relevancy does appear in the record of the case and that this imperfection in the bill of exceptions can be corrected by reference to that record. We can not give to the word  \"record\" as it is used in the last part of said article 500 its ordinary signification. If it means there only the complaint, answer, bill of exceptions, decision, and judgment, that provision of the article would be useless. Imperfections in the bill of exceptions, decision, and judgment, that provision of the article would be useless. Imperfections in the bill of exceptions could rarely be corrected by reference to those documents. Resort would have to be made to what took place at the trial or in other proceedings in the court below. We therefore hold that the word  \"record\" as there used includes everything that was done in that court. <br/><br/>The defendant subjects to the allowance of the amendment on the ground, among others, that the defendant prepared the bill of exceptions; that this statement should have been placed in it, and that the defendant has been negligent in prosecuting his appeal and asking for this relief. It appears that the case was tried below by Señor Avanceña; that before the decision he moved to Manila to take office in the Fiscalia; that Señor Yusay, who had not participated in the trial, prepared the bill of exceptions; that they were prepared and presented in haste, as the term was about to close. The certified copy of the bill of exceptions was received in this court on May 31, and Señor Yusay then notified thereof. The printed copies were delivered to the parties on September 1. It is plain that there has been delay and negligence on the part of the defendant, but there is no claim that it has prejudiced the plaintiff except that if the amendment is allowed the case may have to go over to the November, 1903, term of the court at Iloilo. The plaintiff is protected by a bond which was required by the court below as a condition precedent to a stay of execution. It is also said that the bill of exceptions was presented one day after the term closed at which the case was tried. But it appears that the judge acted upon the bill so presented; that notice of this action was waived by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has made no motion to dismiss the bill on that ground. The plaintiff also claims that the amendment should not be allowed because in no event can the defendant prevail on his appeal, his exceptions being all without merit. But on this application we can not go into the merits of the appeal. There has been no argument upon that subject. It is the purpose of article 500 to enable the appellant in this way to get his bill of exceptions in such shape that he can present and argue the questions of law which are raised thereby. <br/><br/>We have had considerable doubt not over the power of the court to grant this motion but over the propriety of so doing. We have, however, finally decided to do so on terms which we think will protect the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Within ten days after the arrival in Iloilo of the judge of that province, the defendant on five days’ notice to the plaintiff may move said judge that he add to the bill of exceptions a statement in substance as follows:  \"The cane mentioned in the complainant belonged to Jose de Luna before it belonged to the plaintiff.\" The order of the judge granting or denying the motion shall be certified to this court. The defendant shall serve his brief on the plaintiff within thirty days after the date of the order of said judge. The plaintiff shall have thirty days in which to reply, and the cause shall, at the option of the plaintiff, be heard in Manila at any time when the court is in session on ten days’ previous notice to the defendant. This order is conditional on the defendant within five days after notice thereof paying to the clerk for the benefit of plaintiff the sum of ten dollars, United States currency. If this sum is not paid the motion will be dismissed. <br/><br/>Torres, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>This is an application made by the appellant, the defendant in the court below, to amend a bill of exceptions. It is stated that the defendant on the trial of the case offered in evidence certain documents which were, on the objection by the plaintiff, excluded by the court, and to which ruling the defendant excepted. That in order that the relevancy of the document may appear the bill of exceptions should show  \"that the cane mentioned in the complaint belonged to Jose de Luna before it belonged to the plaintiff.\" The appellant requests that the judge of the Court of First Instance be required to certify this in the bill of exceptions. The motion has been granted. The decision of the court is based upon the construction given article 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901. <br/><br/>So far as it is material to the consideration of the question that article reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Nor shall such dismissal be granted whereby an amendment to the bill of exceptions which is hereby declared to be lawful and allowable and imperfections or omissions of necessary and proper allegations could be corrected from the record in the case.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It is not contended that the proposed amendment can be effected by reference to anything that is contained in the record of this court or anything so far as that is concerned contained in the lower court, unless the word  \"record\" as used in the last part of article 500 be given a different meaning from that which it possesses according to the ordinary signification of the term. <br/><br/>The question to be determined is, whether under the provisions above cited an amendment of the bill of exceptions can be made in this court so as to incorporate in it oral testimony taken in the court below upon the trial of the case. <br/><br/>The decision of the court is to the effect that this may be done, and that the word  \"record\" as used in the last part of article 500 should not receive its ordinary signification; that the word should be considered in its meaning so as to include everything that was done in the Court of First Instance, and that the oral testimony, though not reduced to writing, is a part of the record within the meaning of the word as so construed. <br/><br/>It is unnecessary to cite definitions of the word  \"record,\" for it is admitted that the word in receiving the construction given has been wrested from its ordinary signification. <br/><br/>Is the language of the statute so doubtful or does the context show an intention at variance to such an extent with the word  \"record\" as used in its ordinary signification that the first and primary rule of interpretation should be disregarded?<br/><br/>It is said in the opinion that to give the word  \"record\" as used in section 500 its ordinary signification, and if it means only the complaint, answer, bill of exceptions, decision, and judgment, that the provision of the article would be useless, as bills of exceptions could rarely be corrected by reference to those documents. <br/><br/>It is immaterial, in my opinion, whether the word used in its ordinary signification would tend to give the section in question a limited operation or not, or even whether it would have any operation whatever. This would not justify judicial revision, correction, or amendment of the law. <br/><br/>The rule which governs in such cases is well stated in the case of McClusky v. Cromwell (11 N. Y., 593), in the following language:  \"It is beyond question the duty of courts in construing statutes to give effect to the intent of the lawmaking power, and to seek for that intent in every legitimate way, but in the construction both of statutes and contracts the intent of the framers and parties is to be sought first of all in the words employed, and if the words are free from ambiguity and doubt and express plainly, clearly, and distinctly the sense of the framer of the instrument there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation. It is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation, and when the words have a definite and precise meaning to go elsewhere in search of conjecture in order to restrict or extend the meaning. Statutes and contracts should be read and understood according to the natural and most obvious import of the language without resorting to subtle and forced constructions for the purpose of either limiting or extending their application. Courts can not correct supposed errors, omissions, or defects in legislation or vary by construction the contracts of parties. The object of interpretation is to bring sense out of words used and not to bring sense into them.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Some ambiguity might arise from the phrase  \"record in the case,\" whether this means the record as contained in the transcript or the original record as it exists in the lower court. <br/><br/>This question has been decided by the Supreme Court of Georgia in a decision rendered prior to the enactment of our statute, in which the words  \"record in the case\" have been held to mean  \"the record as contained in the transcript sent up and duly certified by the clerk.\" (79 Ga., 210.) <br/><br/>This decision has peculiar weight in determining the question. It was made on the construction of article 5570 of the Code of Georgia, 1895, from which our statute was taken and of which it is a literal copy. The ordinary rule announced in such cases is that if the legislature of a State in enacting a statute literally or substantially copies the language of the statute previously existing in another State or borrows from such statute the provision, clause, or phrase, the same having received a judicial interpretation in the State of its origin, it is presumed that the enactment was made with a knowledge of such interpretation, and that it was the design of the legislature that the act should be understood and applied according to that interpretation. (Black on Interpretation of Laws, p. 159, citing Metropolitan R. R. Co. v. Moore, 121 U. S., 555; Stutsman Co. v. Wallce, 142 U. S,., 293, and various decisions of States not accessible to the court.) <br/><br/>This decision from the court of Georgia affords not only a reasonable construction of the phrase, but is in harmony with the principles applying to the amendment of records under the practice prevailing in the United States. Where the defect is in the trial court record or where the rulings of that court have not been duly entered, the application to correct or amend the record must be made to that court. (Elliott, Appellate Procedure, 206, 2 Enc. Pl. and Prac., 301.) This rule is strictly applicable to the amendment of bills of exception. The court to which the appeal is taken has no power to amend. It is amendable only in the trial court. (3 enc. Pl. and Prac., 502.) it is also a rule that after the expiration of the trial term even the trial court can not make an amendment without some minute or memorandum as evidence on which to base the amendment. (3 Enc. Pl. and Prac., 505.) <br/><br/>It may be urged that as the court has not undertaken to amend the bill of exceptions, but has simply given the appellant leave to apply to the lower court for an amendment, that the question of the right of this court to amend the bill of exceptions does not arise in the case, and that the discussion of the question is premature. <br/><br/>But it will be noticed that while the order passed in the case contemplates that the amendment should be made by the trial judge the discussion of the question has proceeded upon the right of this court to amend the bill of exceptions under the provisions of section 500. Besides, it is immaterial whether section 500 is invoked as authority for the amendment in this court or in the court below. This section of the law can not be construed as giving the right to amend the bill of exceptions in either case in the manner attempted. <br/><br/>If the same rules of practice under our Code are to prevail here as in America, the provisions of which have been largely taken from the Codes of the several States, an amendment of the character permitted can neither be made in this court nor in the court below. <br/><br/>The parties, however, are not entirely without remedy, for, under the practice prevailing in the United States, a motion, timely made, to the lower court for an amendment of the bill of exceptions will be granted. If made within the time for the filing of the bill of exceptions or within the trial term, the judge may permit any character of amendment to be made so as to make the bill of exceptions conform to the facts. After the expiration of the term the power of the trial judge over the bill of exceptions is more restricted and only such matters as are made to appear by some minute or memorandum in the record can be incorporated in the bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>It is also possible that section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, will apply to cases which do not come within these rules. <br/><br/>It reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Upon such terms as may be just the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, provided that application therefor be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The writer is inclined to think that the provisions of this section are sufficiently broad to cover amendments of bills of exceptions of the character applied for in this case. But the application can not be granted under this provision, for the reason that it was not applied for within six months from the date of the bill of exceptions, and further, because the allegations of the application are wholly insufficient. <br/><br/>There is no allegation whatever of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable negligence. <br/><br/>The court recognizes in its decision the insufficiency of the application in this respect when it says that it is plain that there has been delay and negligence upon the part of the defendant. By reference to the bill of exceptions it will be seen that the provisions of the Code and the rules of this court have been ignored by the <em>Appellant</em>. The final judgment was rendered in the case on the 11th day of February, 1902. <br/><br/>Section 143 of the Code requires that a party desiring to prosecute a bill of exceptions shall so inform the court at the time of the rendition of final judgment or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and before the ending of the term of court at which final judgment is rendered. <br/><br/>This provision was not complied with. <br/><br/>Within ten days afterwards the excepting party is required to present to the judge a brief statement of the facts in the case sufficient to show the bearing of the rulings excepted to, for allowance by the judge. This was not done until the 21st day of February, one day after the adjournment of the court. <br/><br/>The statute also requires that within five days from such presentation to the judge the bill of exceptions shall be allowed and filed. It was not allowed and filed until the 14th day of March. <br/><br/>Section 14 of the rules of this court require that the appellant shall within sixty days after the bill of exceptions is filed cause the proper certified copies to be filed in the clerk’s office of this court, and if they are not so filed the court will, on application by the appellee, declare the bill of exceptions abandoned, unless for cause then shown it extends the time for the filing of such copies. The bill of exceptions was filed in the case on the 14th day of March. The certified copy of the bill was not filed in this court until the 31st day of May. <br/><br/>Section 15 of the rules provides that upon the receipt of the certified copy of the bill of exceptions the clerk shall make an estimate of the expense of printing the same, and notify the appellant thereof, and if after such notice the appellant fails to furnish the money necessary for the printing of the transcript the court may, on motion of the appellee, declare the bill of exceptions abandoned. The appellant was duly notified by the clerk on the 31st day of May, 1902, and on the 29th day of August the rule had not been complied with, on which date, on account of this failure the appellee moved to dismiss the bill of exceptions. Neither have the rules of this court with reference to filing assignments of errors and the printing of brief been complied with; in fact, there seems to have been no effort whatever made by the appellant to comply with the rules or the statute, nor any excuse given for his failure to do so. He simply states in his application that the amendment is necessary in order that the relevancy of the ruling of the court may appear. Not even the poor excuse that his attorney was changed after the trial, referred to in the opinion of the court, is given in the application, for this was stated only in the oral argument on the application to amend. It is also to be further noticed that the bill of exceptions was prepared by appellant’s own attorney. It is difficult to imagine a case in which a more flagrant violation of the statutes and rules of the court could occur. <br/><br/>To grant such an application tends strongly toward the exercise of arbitrary discretion. The indulgence shown in the case has been done with a view to prevent the possible miscarriage of justice. <br/><br/>But the exercise of such power subverts the law and finally defeats its own object. The danger is strongly portrayed in the following celebrated words of Lord Camden:  \"The discretion of the judge is the law of tyrants; it is always unknown; it is different in different men; it is casual and depends upon constitution, temper, and passion; in the best it is oftentimes caprice, in the worst it is every vice, folly, and passion to which human nature is liable.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>By the establishment of such precedents the domain of doubt is extended so as to embrace not only the lawyer who neglects to read or fails to comprehend the statute and rules of the court but also embraces the diligent and intelligent attorney who reads and comprehends the statutes and rules but remains in doubt as to what construction and application shall be made of them by the courts of the country. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated, I dissent from the decision. </div>'\n",

The other defendant, Salandanan, has also acknowledged by implication the truth of the facts charged in the information, but has endeavored to excuse himself by alleging, without proving his statements, that although he accompanied the persons who committed the crime, and was armed with a gun, it was because he also had been kidnaped. <br/><br/>These facts constitute the crime of illegal detention, defined and punished by article 481 of the Penal Code. The judge below so held correctly, and condemned the defendants to eight years and one day of prision mayor, not applying any circumstance in mitigation of the responsibility arising from the commission of the crime prosecuted. <br/><br/>The defense in this instance admits that the guilt of the defendants is disclosed by the record, but contends for them as a mitigating circumstance, in the first place, the loss of self-control which, it is alleged, was naturally produced with respect to both of them by reasons of the suspicion they entertained that the injured parties were members of the secret police. There is nothing in the record to justify such an assertion, and this alone is sufficient to demonstrate, without the necessity of further consideration, the inadmissibility of such contention. It is absolutely necessary, in order to consider the concurrence in the commission of a crime of the mitigating circumstance invoked by the defense, that the record contain proof of the causes which are supposed to have produced such powerful excitement as to overcome reason and self-control. <br/><br/>Counsel for the defense also invokes the circumstance of race, established by article 11 of the Penal Code. This circumstance is not necessarily mitigating. It rests in the discretion of the courts to apply it in mitigation or aggravation according to the special circumstances of each case. In the present case no reason can be found which would lead us to apply this circumstance as a ground for the mitigation of the penalty in favor of the defendants. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendants.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case was tried in the Court of First Instance of Mauban, Tayabas, for the crime of murder. The defendants Miguel Arevalo and Germiniano Almagro appealed to this court against the judgment of May 12, 1902, by which the two defendants mentioned and the third defendant, Catalino Ortiz, who did not appeal, were condemned to the penalty of life imprisonment (cadena perpetua), with the accessories, and to the payment of civil damages. While the case was pending here Mr. Lionel D. Hargis and the Solicitor-General filed a joint motion asking the court to declare that the defendants are entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4 last, and that they be acquitted and restored to liberty, after taking the required oath. <br/><br/>The facts in the case are that one night in the month of July, 1901, Mariano de Mesa, who was held as a prisoner by a party of revolutionists who were scouring the province under command of Maj. Ruperto Reus, was put to death, it being supposed that he was a spy of the American Army. Catalino Ortiz and Miguel Arevalo were those who actually committed the crime by order of Germiniano Almagro, who was the captain of the party, and who in turn acted upon orders received from the said Major Reus. <br/><br/>The crime was classified as murder because the aggressors, in order to assure the consummation of the crime without any risk which might arise from an attempt on the part of the victim to defend himself, tied him to a telegraph pole, and while he was in this defenseless condition inflicted upon him with a cutting weapon three wounds, in the head, on the chin, and in his right side, which wounds resulted in his death. His body was found in this condition on the following day by the police of the town of Atimonan. Attached to it was a paper stating that he had been killed as a spy. <br/><br/>From the facts related it follows that the murder in question is of a political character and is a result of the political hatred or of political dissensions between Filipinos, as both the deceased and the defendants were natives of the Islands. The defendants were revolutionists and were members of the revolutionary faction. Furthermore, they killed the supposed spy, Mariano de Mesa, by order of the said Maj. Ruperto Reus, who was commanding the party, his orders having been transmitted to the defendant through Almagro, who styled himself captain. it does not appear that the crime was due to any personal resentment, but simply to the belief that Mesa was in fact a spy and an enemy to the revolution. <br/><br/>As Almagro and Arevalo appealed from the judgment rendered against them in the court below, and the appeal is now pending before us, it is evident that they have not been convicted by final judgment, and therefore it follows that, from the facts above stated, they are entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation. But the other defendant, Catalino Ortiz, did not appeal and therefore with respect to him the judgment below became a finality. He, therefore, falls within one of the excepted cases foreseen in the amnesty decree, and consequently this court is without jurisdiction to apply the amnesty to him; but he may present a special petition to that end to the proper executive authorities. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated we hold that the defendants Germiniano Almagro and Miguel Arevalo are entitled to the benefits of the amnesty of July 4 last, and, upon taking before a competent officer the oath prescribed in the said proclamation, they will be set at liberty. The judge will forward to this court proof of compliance with the instructions contained herein, together with the original oaths.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Both the private prosecutor and the defendant have appealed from the judgment of the court below, finding the defendant guilty of the offense of injurias graves under articles 457 and 458 of the Penal Code, and sentencing him to pay a fine of 4,000 pesetas, with subsidiary imprisonment and costs. <br/><br/>(1)\tNo brief has been filed by the defendant, nor did he appear, either personally or by counsel, on the day fixed for the argument, and under the rules of this court the motion that his appeal be dismissed for lack of prosecution might be granted, but we have nevertheless deemed it proper to consider the whole case upon the merits. The evidence shows that the defendant was in September, 1901, the editor of  \"Miau,\" a periodical published and circulated in Manila, and that an article containing the alleged injurious matter was published in the issue of that periodical of September 15, 1901. The article is couched throughout in grossly abusive language, and in terms not capable of being misunderstood; charges the private prosecutor, who had been then recently appointed a member of the United States Philippine Commission, with having displayed cowardice at the time of the murder of his mother and sister and with having subsequently entered into intimate political relations with the assassin. The article contains other statements and imputations of a derogatory character, but we base our opinion upon that portion to which reference has been made. Injurias graves are classified by article 457 of the Penal Code under four heads, as follows:\" (1) The imputation of a crime of the class not subject to prosecution de oficio. (2) That of a vice or moral shortcoming, the consequences of which might seriously injure the reputation, credit, or interests of the person offended. (3) Injurias which by reason of their nature, occasion, or circumstances are commonly regarded as insulting. (4) Those which may be reasonably classified as grave in view of the condition, dignity, and personal circumstances of the injured party and the offender.\" The statements in question do not involve the imputation of a crime, and, possibly, not a vice or moral shortcoming in the strict sense, but they are obviously of a character calculated to bring the person attacked into public obloquy and contempt, and specially so in the present case in view of the position of the private prosecutor as a high official of the Government, and they are therefore clearly comprehended under Nos. 3 and 4 of the article cited. The defendant’s offer to prove the truth of the statements was properly rejected. (Penal Code, art. 460.) The conviction must be sustained. <br/><br/>(2)\tThe question raised by the appeal of the private prosecutor relates solely to the propriety of the punishment imposed by the court below. Article 458 of the Penal Code provides that  \"injurias graves, put into writing and made public which is the present case shall be punished with the penalty of destierro in its medium to its maximum degree, and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas.\" Act No. 277 of the United States Philippine Commission  \"defining the law of libel,\" etc., and reforming the preexisting Spanish law on the subject of calumnia and injurias affixes to the offense of publishing a libel as defined in the act the punishment of  \"a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for not exceeding one year, or both.\" Section 13 of the same act provides as follows:  \"All laws and parts of laws now in force, so far as the same may be in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall operate as a repeal of existing laws in so far as they are applicable to pending actions or existing causes of action, but as to such causes of action or pending actions existing laws shall remain in full force and effect.\" This act went into effect October 24, 1901, subsequent to the publication of the article in question, and during the pendency of the prosecution. By article 22 of the Penal Code  \"Penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a crime or misdemeanor,: etc. The court below in fixing the punishment proceeded upon the theory that by the operation of this general rule the penalty prescribed in the Penal Code for the offense in question was necessarily modified and could not be inflicted in its full extension. In so doing we think the court overlooked or improperly construed the proviso in the section of Act No. 277, above cited, by virtue of which the previously existing law on the subject covered by the act is left intact in all its parts as respects pending actions or existing causes of action. The language is general and embraces, we think, all actions, whether civil, criminal, or of a mixed character. In this view of the case we have no occasion to consider the question argued by counsel for the private prosecutor as to whether the provisions of Act No. 277 respecting the penalty are more favorable to the accused than those of the former law or otherwise. The punishment must be determined exclusively by the provisions of the former law. <br/><br/>It is urged by counsel that the official position of the private prosecutor should be considered as an aggravating circumstance under Penal Code, article 10, No. 20. We are inclined to think that in the view we have taken of the case this circumstance is qualificative rather than generic. (Penal Code, art. 78.) <br/><br/>The result, then, is that the penalty prescribed by article 458, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code should be applied in its medium grade, and in view of all the circumstances of the case we fix the penalty as four years of destierro and a fine of 4,000 pesetas, with subsidiary liability to one day’s banishment for every 12 1/2 pesetas not paid, and the costs of both instances. The judgment of the court below will be modified in accordance with this opinion, and the record will be returned to that court for the execution of the sentence as thus modified.

We do not understand that it is claimed by counsel for the defendant that the language of the letter is not defamatory, but appears to be claimed that the  \"private, confidential, and secret\" character of the letter is sufficient to rebut the presumption that the publication was malicious. <br/><br/>The new libel law, under which this prosecution was brought, attaches the presumption of malice to an injurious publication,  \"if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\" (Act of the United States Philippine Commission, No. 277, sec. 3.) Without undertaking to state what motives may be deemed justifiable under this act, it is sufficient with reference to the present case to say that it would involve a contradiction in terms to hold that the letter in question — a solicitation to commit adultery — was published by the defendant with justifiable motives. There is nothing in the case to rebut the presumption of malice which arises from the mere fact of publication. <br/><br/>It is further claimed that it was not shown that the defendant parted with the custody of the letter  \"under such circumstances that as a natural and logical consequence it might be read by a third person.\" Section 5 of the Libel Act provides that  \"to sustain a charge of publishing a libel, . . . it is enough that the accused knowingly parted with the immediate custody of the libel under circumstances which exposed it to be read or seen by any other person than himself.\" The circumstances of the present case meet these conditions fully. <br/><br/>An examination of the record shows that the statement of counsel that the court below did not permit the defendant to testify at the trial in his own behalf, upon which the first assignment of error is based, is not true in point of fact. The same is the case with reference to the statement upon which the second assignment of error is based, viz, that the court permitted the wife of the private prosecutor to testify without the previous consent of both spouses. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, the subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency to be at the rate of one day for every 12 1/2 pesetas, such imprisonment not to exceed six months in all.

Three days afterwards the head of Don Juan, wrapped in a sack (bayan), was found suspended from the bridge in the pueblo of Silay. Upon the outside of the sack was this inscription:  \"Juan Carballo, hombre pernicioso a la revolucion. E. P. D. (Juan Carballo, a bad man for the revolution. R. I. P.) <br/><br/>Don Juan Carballo was killed by reason of a written order issued by a council of war convened by the revolutionary forces then operating in that province. The officer then in command of these forces was Luis Ginete. Before this council of war the defendant acted as judge-advocate. According to the testimony in this case, the decision of the council was that Don Juan be brought before them for trial. The charges against him were that he was a spy and guide of the Americans. The order provided that in case of resistance he should be killed. This order the defendant delivered to the persons charged with its execution. There was no attempt made to arrest Don Juan. he was attacked and killed without warning. <br/><br/>The defendant was tried for the murder of the deceased and was acquitted. The provincial fiscal appealed. In this court the Solicitor-General asks that the defendant be discharged on the ground that he is included in the amnesty of July 4, 1902. While the defendant has asked us to pass upon the merits of the case, yet he also asks the benefit of the amnesty and has filed here the oath required by the proclamation. <br/><br/>His case is clearly within its terms. He was participating against the United States in the revolution. He was acting pursuant to the orders of his superior, Luis Ginete. The killing of Don Juan Carballo was an offense of a political character. (United States v. Vicente Villamor, August 29, 1902.) Upon its facts the case at bar is practically the same as the case cited. Under the circumstances we do not feel called upon to decide this case on its merits. Such a decision would involve the determination of questions concerning the status of Filipinos engaged in the revolution, and their liability, civilly and criminally, before the courts for acts committed in the prosecution of that revolution. These questions are of such importance that they ought not to be decided in a case where such a decision is unnecessary. The defendant was acquitted below, and a holding that he is included in the amnesty in no way prejudices his rights. <br/><br/>Therefore, assuming, without deciding, that he is legally responsible for the killing of Don Juan Carballo, we hold that he is included in the amnesty.

An application has been made for the discharge of the accused under the provisions of the amnesty granted by the President of the United States by his proclamation of the 4th of July, 1902. <br/><br/>It is stated in the application that the accused is a Filipino and that the crime was committed by him while taking part in the insurrection against the Spanish Government in these Islands, and that the offense has the character of a political crime committed during the course of the insurrection, in obedience to orders given by the military authority of the insurrection, or, at least, the offense was committed as the result of internal political feuds and dissensions among the Filipinos; that the death of the deceased was not committed through any personal motive, and therefore the accused is comprehended in the proclamation of amnesty, and asks this court that he be placed at liberty after his taking and subscribing the oath of allegiance prescribed in the amnesty proclamation. <br/><br/>The testimony in the case shows that the defendant, Marcelo de Guzman, was a captain in the insurgent army and had many posts under his command, and often visited the pueblo of Binmaley during the time that the insurgents occupied that pueblo. That upon one occasion on one of his visits there, about the time the Spanish army surrendered at Dagupan, the deceased, Pelagio Bonifacio, was brought before Guzman, the defendant, charged as a spy of the Spaniards; that deceased was interrogated by Guzman and admitted that he was a spy, whereupon the defendant, after assaulting and abusing him, ordered a couple of soldiers under his command to carry the deceased to the cemetery near by, there to be killed. The order was duly executed by the soldiers. <br/><br/>The defendant testified in the case and stated that his action was based on an order given by one Vicente Prado, his superior in command, who directed him to look out for a spy in the pueblo of Binmaley and when found to have him executed; that the deceased was captured and brought before him, and having been asked whether he was a spy or not answered in the affirmative, and thereupon he reported the circumstances back to Vicente Prado, who ordered the defendant to kill the deceased. <br/><br/>This statement as to the defendant having received direct orders from Vicente Prado for the execution of the deceased is not borne out by the testimony of the witnesses, who state that no sooner had the deceased been brought in the presence of the defendant than the deceased was struck by the defendant and ordered to be taken off and shot. <br/><br/>However, it appears beyond doubt that the commission of the offense was done by the defendant as an officer in the insurgent army, and that it grew out of internal political feuds and dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or out of the political feuds and dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during the Spanish insurrection. <br/><br/>Following the cases decided at the present term of this court of the United States v. Vicente Villamor; United States v. Anastasio Carmona; United States v. Jose Guzman Et. Al., it must be held that the defendant brings himself within the amnesty proclamation of the President, and that he is entitled to be discharged upon his taking and subscribing the oath prescribed in the amnesty proclamation before any authority in the Philippine Archipelago authorized to administer oaths. Upon such oath being presented to this court the defendant will be ordered discharged from custody. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, and Torres, <em>J.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, with whom concur Smith and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>We concur in the result in this case, inasmuch as the accused acted under orders from his superior, Vicente Prado.

As she refused to accede to his desires he endeavored to rape her. He seized her and was about to throw her on the ground when he was surprised by the defendant, who at that moment returned to the house and who rushed in upon hearing his wife’s screams for help. Alba, upon seeing the defendant, turned on the woman and inflicted upon her a serious wound in the right forearm with a bolo he was carrying and then immediately attacked the defendant, wounding him in the breast. A hand-to-hand struggle followed between them, in the course of which the defendant succeeded in snatching the bolo from Alba’s hands and with it inflicted upon him a wound from which he died shortly after. <br/><br/>Such are the facts established by the evidence in the record. Upon them the court below held the defendant to be guilty of the crime of homicide, and applying in his favor the mitigating circumstances of immediate provocation and of excitement sufficient to overcome reason and self-control, condemned him to six years and one day of prision mayor. <br/><br/>The court below was of the opinion that the complete defense of section 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code could not be applied, because,  \"although it may be admitted,\" he says,  \"that the defendant acted in self-defense, and that there was an unlawful aggression without provocation on his part, nevertheless the reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the aggression has not been proven, because after the deceased was deprived of the weapon with which he made the attack he, the defendant, had no necessity to employ the weapon to ward off the attack of his adversary.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We do not concur in this opinion of the court below. The deceased, having attacked the defendant and his wife with a bolo, and having wounded both of them, and having made an unsuccessful attempt, frustrated by the defendant, to rape the latter’s wife, and having continued his aggression up to the point of commencing and maintaining a hand-to-hand struggle with the defendant, it can not be said that the latter exceeded the limits of a just defense in wounding the aggressor in the act with the same bolo with which he had been attacked and wounded. It does not appear that the struggle ceased after the weapon was taken from the aggressor. Consequently it can not be asserted that the danger to the defendant had ceased. If the struggle continued the defendant might in turn have been disarmed by the deceased in the course of the changing fortunes of the fight; in which case he would have been completely at the mercy of his adversary. This was a contingency which the accused might well have reasonably feared, more especially in view of the fact that having received a somewhat serious wound in the breast which might well, under these critical circumstances, have appeared to him to be much more serious than it really was, he was in a disadvantageous position with respect to his adversary for a continuation of a prolonged hand-to-hand struggle. This fear, added to the natural instinct of self-defense, strongly excited by this fierce attack, must have instinctively impelled him to avail himself of the advantage momentarily thrown in his way by a fortunate accident of the affray to put his aggressor hors de combat in the only way possible in the heat of the fight. We can not require a man who finds himself so forcibly and persistently attacked as was the accused to retain the presence of mind necessary to pick and choose, and to employ some other less violent means, more especially when we remember the natural rapidity with which the defense must necessarily be made if it is to produce the effect of repelling the aggressor. <br/><br/>For these reasons, there having been an unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased without provocation of any kind on the part of the accused, we are of the opinion that his act in defense of his person complies with all the conditions which in accordance with section 4, article 8, of the Penal Code wholly exempt him from criminal liability. <br/><br/>We therefore acquit the defendant and reverse the judgment below, with the costs of both instances de oficio. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff, at the commencement of this action obtained a preliminary injunction as prayed for in its complaint. The case was afterwards tried, and in September, 1902, a final judgment therein was entered in favor of the defendants and the temporary injunction was dissolved. <br/><br/>On the 20th of September a bill of exceptions was perfected and signed by the judge, and a certified copy thereof was then transmitted to this court. In this court the plaintiff has presented a motion asking that the preliminary injunction be continued. <br/><br/>Before discussing the power of this court to grant a preliminary injunction, under these circumstances, it seems necessary to determine whether or not the preliminary injunction granted below was continued in force by the filing of the bill of exceptions. Article 144 of the Law of Civil Procedure, now in force, says:  \"But the filing of a bill of exceptions shall of itself stay execution until the final determination of the action, unless,\" etc. Article 1007 of the Revised Statutes of the United States states the manner of obtaining a supersedeas in cases pending in the Federal courts. The meaning of the word  \"supersedeas\" as used in that section has been defined as follows:  \"A supersedeas, properly so called, is a suspension of the power of the court below to issue an execution on the judgment or decree appealed from; or, if a writ of execution has issued, it is a prohibition emanating from the court of appeals against the execution of the writ.\" (Hovey v. McDonald, 109 U. S., 150.) <br/><br/>As so construed, article 1007 of the Revised Statutes of the United States is substantially the equivalent of our article 144. This question as to whether a supersedeas has, in the Federal courts, the effect of continuing in force an injunction dissolved by the lower court has frequently been passed upon by the Supreme Court. That court has said:  \"The general ruling is well settled that an appeal from a decree granting, refusing, or dissolving an injunction does not disturb its operative effect. (Hovey v. McDonald, 109 U. S., 150-161; Slaughterhouse Cases, 10 Wall., 273-297; Leonard v. Ozark Land Company, 115 U. S., 465-468.) When an injunction has been dissolved it can not be revived except by a new exercise of judicial power, and no appeal by a dissatisfied party can of itself revive it.\" (Knox Co. v. Harshman, 132 U. S., 14.) <br/><br/>\"The truth is that the case is not governed by the ordinary rules that relate to a supersedeas of execution, but by those principles and rules which relate to chancery proceedings exclusively . . . In this country the matter is usually regulated by statutes or rules of court, and, generally speaking, an appeal, upon giving the security required by law, when security is required, suspends further proceedings and operates as a supersedeas of execution . . . But the decree itself may have an intrinsic effect which can only be suspended by an affirmative order either of the court which makes the decree or of the appellate tribunal. This court, in the Slaughterhouse Cases, 10 Wall., 273, decided that an appeal from a decree granting, refusing, or dissolving an injunction does not disturb its operative effect. Mr. Justice Clifford, delivering the opinion of the court, says: ’It is quite certain that neither an injunction nor a decree dissolving an injunction passed in circuit court is reversed or nullified by an appeal or writ of error before the cause is heard in this court.’ It was decided that neither a decree for an injunction nor a decree dissolving an injunction was suspended in its effect by the writ of error, though all the requisites for supersedeas were complied with. It was not decided that the court below had no power, if the purpose of justice required it, to order a continuance of the status quo until a decision should be made by the appellate court, or until that court should order the contrary. This power undoubtedly exists, and should always be exercised when any irremediable injury may result from the decree as rendered.\" (Hovey v. McDonald, 109, U. S., 159.) <br/><br/>In Minnesota the supersedeas statute provided that the appeal from the order of judgment should  \"stay all proceedings thereon and save all rights affected thereby.\" The court of this State, relying upon the last of the two clauses quoted, held that an appeal from an order dissolving an injunction continued the injunction in force. The evils which would result from such a holding are forcibly pointed out by Judge Mitchell in a dissenting opinion. He said:  \"Although a plaintiff’s papers are so insufficient on their face or so false in their allegations that if he should apply on notice for an injunction, any court would, on a hearing, promptly refuse to grant one, yet, if he can find anywhere in the State a judge or court commissioner who will improvidently grant one ex parte, which the court on the first and only hearing ever had dissolves, he can, by appealing and filing a bond, make the ex parte injunction impervious to all judicial interference until the appeal is determined in this court . . . Such a result is so unjust and so utterly inconsistent with all known rules of equity practice that no court should adopt such a construction unless absolutely shut up to it by the clear and unequivocal language of the statute.\" (State v. Duluth St. Ry. Co., 47 Minn. 369.) <br/><br/>The supreme court of that State afterwards, although adhering to that decision on the ground of stare decisis, stated that in their opinion it was unsound. (State ex rel. Leary v. District Court, 78 Minn., 464.) <br/><br/>We have in these Islands no appeal from orders granting or dissolving preliminary injunctions, yet what was said by Justice Mitchell applies to a case where, upon a full trial in a court below, the judge has decided that neither upon the facts nor the law is the plaintiff entitled to any relief. To allow a plaintiff in such a case, by taking an appeal and giving a supersedeas bond, to continue an injunction in force would be manifestly unjust. <br/><br/>We adopt the rule announced by the Supreme Court of the United States and hold that the filing of the bill of exceptions in the case at bar did not operate to revive the preliminary injunction which was dissolved in and by the final judgment. <br/><br/>We also adopt the other conclusion of that court to the effect that the judge below has the power, if the purposes of justice require it, to order a continuance of the status quo until a decision should be made by the appellate court or until that court should order to the contrary. We have already in effect declared that principle in the case of Maximo Cortes v. Palanca Yutivo, decided August 6, 1902. <br/><br/>Article 163 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that  \"a preliminary injunction may be granted by any judge of the Supreme Court in any action pending in the Supreme Court.\" This language is broad enough to include not only actions commenced here within the original jurisdiction of this court, but also actions pending here on a bill of exceptions or appeal. We therefore have the power to grant a preliminary injunction in the present case. The motion is based upon the bill of exceptions and upon nothing else. If no error was committed by the court below, the plaintiff can not recover in the action, and of course would not be entitled to a preliminary injunction. We have looked into the record far enough to satisfy us that the probabilities of the plaintiff prevailing in this court are not strong enough to justify us in granting the temporary relief asked. The motion is denied. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 1st of November, 1901, the defendant was a clerk in the custom-house at Manila. Whenever there was presented to him a petition asking that a license be granted to enable a vessel to engage in the coastwise trade it was his official duty to make out a note in triplicate showing the tonnage of the vessel and the amount of the fee charged for the license (which fee was at the rate of $1 for each ton). This triplicate note, after approval by the head of the Department, was taken by the applicant to the cashier, the dues paid, one of the triplicate notes with the cashier’s receipt returned to the defendant, who thereupon issued the license and delivered it and the note and the receipt to the applicant. <br/><br/>On the 4th or 5th of November Juan urnales, a clerk of one Zapirain, presented to the defendant at his desk in the custom-house a petition for a license for the vessel Dolores. He presented at the same time the old license. This showed that the tonnage was $325.73. Instead of making out the triplicate note for $325.73 he made it out $25.73. This, if done knowingly and intentionally, would constitute the crime of falsification defined in article 300,4. The defendant in his testimony says that the mistake was unintentional. We can not credit this testimony. The evidence shows that under the pretense that the cashier would not receive silver dollars, but only bank bills, he got urnales to give him the bag of $326 which he (Urnales) was carrying, presented to the cashier the triplicate note showing the dues to be $25.73, paid the sum of $25.73, altered the payee’s note by placing a figure  \"3\" before the number  \"25.73,) and delivered it to Urnales with the license. The fraud was discovered the day on which the payment was made. The next morning the defendant went to the hotel of Mr. Mobley, his chief, promised to repay the $300 that morning and deposited with him $300 in bills as security for his undertaking. Later in the same forenoon he caused $300 to be paid to the cashier. The defendant denies most of this testimony, but to our minds it is conclusive against him, notwithstanding the evidence of his good character and the alleged contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses for the Government pointed out in the brief of his counsel in this court. <br/><br/>What has been said disposes of the fifth, sixth, and seventh points of that brief. <br/><br/>The point is also made that the trial was void because part of the testimony was taken in English. It appears that the evidence referred to was taken at the preliminary hearing and not at the trial. Moreover, there is no claim that this in any way prejudiced the rights of the defendant. Under article 10 of General Orders, No. 58, it must be disregarded. <br/><br/>It is also claimed that the complaint states the crime of falsification with estafa, or both crimes, in violation of article 11 of General Orders, No. 58. The complaint does not support this claim. There are no facts alleged which show that the crime of estafa as defined in any one of the paragraphs of article 535 was committed. There is no allegation in the complaint that any money was received by the defendant from any one. The claim that the defendant voluntarily desisted from his unlawful purpose can not be sustained. He made no effort to return the money until after his crime had been discovered and became known at the custom-house. <br/><br/>The court below convicted the defendant under article 301, holding that the defendant was a private person. We can not agree with this conclusion. We think that he was a public functionary, and therefore included in article 300. The term  \"public functionary\" is defined by article 401 as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"For the purposes of this chapter and the preceding chapters of the present book, all persons who, by direct requirement of law, or by popular election, or by public appointment by competent authority, participate in the exercise of public functions, shall be regarded as public functionaries.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant was a public functionary within this definition, and the offense was committed in the discharge of the very duties imposed upon him by his superiors. <br/><br/>The judgment below is in all things confirmed, except that the punishment is hereby fixed at twelve years and one day instead of six years and one day.

In order that a public official may be convicted of bribery he must have accepted a bribe for his committing in the discharge of the duties of his office an act constituting a crime. It therefore becomes necessary to consider whether the official if he had accepted the bribe in the discharge of his office in the particular case, would have committed an act constituting a crime as defined in article 354 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Suppose that the officer in consideration of the note had decided to make a favorable report on the application and had made such a report. This would not of itself have constituted the offense defined in article 354. It must have been an unjust decision knowingly rendered. The information contains no allegation embodying this requisite. <br/><br/>For the same reason the charge is defective under article 382. Perhaps the information might be held sufficient under article 386, which is against the public official who shall accept presents in consideration of his official position. But the punishment for this offense is suspension in its minimum and medium degree, and public censure; and as the same penalty applies to persons offering or giving the bribe as those imposed on the officer suborned it is evident that the punishment can not be the same and is therefore not applicable to the case. <br/><br/>Other interesting questions have been raised not necessary to consider. <br/><br/>On account of the insufficiency of the information in the particulars indicated the judgment of the Court of First Instance is reversed and the case remanded, with costs of the appeal de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, concurring, I agree with the result. <br/><br/>Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in the case. </div>'\n",

This tract contained 152.46 square meters of land. A broker, representing the plaintiff, stated to the defendant that this lot was for sale and, on information received from the plaintiff, that it measured 23 meters in front and 8 meters in depth. <br/><br/>The broker had nothing more to do with the matter, and the plaintiff and defendant had certain negotiations between themselves concerning the sale. <br/><br/>On March 13, 1901, the defendant signed the following document:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"On this date I have bought from Don Francisco Yrureta Goyena a lot at No. 20 Calle San Jose, Ermita, for the sum of thirty-two hundred pesos, this money to be paid as soon as the bill of sale is signed. Manila, March 12, 1901. (Signed) Tambunting.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The plaintiff signed a similar document. What the negotiations between the parties were prior to the signing of these documents does not appear. There is no evidence whatever in the record that they came to any agreement in regard to the sale other than the one contained in the papers of March 12. <br/><br/>The defendant took from the office of the notary employed to make the formal transfer the title papers which showed the area of the lot of land to be 152.46 square meters, kept them for several days, and returned them to the notary. On the day assigned for the execution of the instrument, all the parties being in the office of the notary, the defendant told the latter to insert in the writing the price, $3,200, and then refused to sign it because the lot did not contain the area which the plaintiff, through the broker, had represented that it contained. He expressed his willingness to sign it if a proportional reduction was made in the price. This the plaintiff refused to make, and this action was brought under article 1451 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>The question to be decided is: Ought the plaintiff to make this reduction?<br/><br/>The private contract expresses a specific thing as the object of the contract. Upon this point there is no controversy. There is no doubt as to which lot is No. 20 on Calle San Jose, of the District of Ermita of the city of Manila. <br/><br/>The private contract specifies a certain price, 3,200 pesos. There is no controversy whatsoever upon this point. there is no question that this sum is there specified plainly and specifically, and without being made subject to any condition whatever. <br/><br/>Is this a perfect contract?<br/><br/>Evidently nothing is lacking for the existence of a perfect contract of purchase and sale. Article 1445 of the Civil Code is as follows:  \"By the contract of purchase and sale one of the contracting parties undertakes to deliver a specific thing, and the other to pay therefore a price certain, in money or in some thing representing it.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 1450 of the same Code is as follows:  \"The sale shall be perfected between vendor and vendee and shall be binding on both of them, if they have agreed upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price, even when neither has been delivered.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This private document was not a more draft or project. It can not be said that the purchase is not to be understood as perfected until the execution of the public instrument. That private document is not subject to any term or condition whatever. <br/><br/>The least that can be said about the private document is that it contains a promise to buy, not a mere project of sale, and a promise to buy, according to article 1451, confers upon the contracting parties the right to reciprocally demand the performance of the contract. If the contract were not perfected no right would accrue in favor of the contracting parties to reciprocally demand its performance. A thing which has no existence can produce no effect. <br/><br/>Because it is merely a private document which contemplates the subsequent execution of a public instrument, it does not follow that it is not enforceable as it now stands.  \"Contracts,\" says article 1278,  \"shall be obligatory whatever may be the form in which they have been entered into, provided that the essential elements for their validity are present,\" to wit, a determinate thing, a price certain, and a meeting of the minds with respect to the object of the contract. Hence the contract in question is obligatory. <br/><br/>But the defendant says:  \"I can not pay the 3,200 pesos indicated in the private document, inasmuch as the lot does not contain a sufficient number of meters to be worth this sum total of 3,200 pesos, at so much a meter. I made the purchase at so much a meter.\" He then cites article 1469, 2, which is:  \"If the sale of real property should be made with a statement of its area, at the rate of a certain price for a unit of measure or number, the vendor shall be obliged to deliver to the vendee, if the latter should require it, all that may have been mentioned in the contract; but should this not be possible, the vendee may choose between a proportional reduction in the price or the rescission of the contract: Provided, That in the latter case the decrease in the real estate is not less than one-tenth of the area given it. <br/><br/>\"The same shall be done, even when the area appears to be the same, if any part of the real estate is not of the character mentioned in the contract. <br/><br/>\"The rescission in such case shall only take place at the will of the vendee, when the inferior value of the thing sold exceeds one-tenth of the price agreed upon.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In reply to the contention of the defendant the plaintiff cites article 1471, which says in part:  \"In the sale of real estate made for a fixed price and not at the rate of a specified sum for a unit of measure or number, the increase or decrease of the same shall not be considered, even when greater or less area or amount than that stated in the contract may be found.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The plaintiff also says:  \"The fact is that in a private document no statement is made of any superficial area, nor of a price on the basis of a unit of measure or number. Hence, I am under no obligation to deliver any determinate area or number or measure, but simply lot No. 20 Calle San Jose, as to whose specific individuality there is no controversy or doubt.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 1218 says:  \"Public documents may be used as evidence against the contracting parties and those who contract under them with respect to the statements therein contained, made by the contracting parties.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 1225 says:  \"A private document, legally acknowledged, has the same value as the public instrument between those who have signed the same, and their privies.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Hence it follows that, whether evidenced by a public instrument or by a private document, the contract is what the words of the parties indicate. It will not avail the defendant to say,  \"But my intention was not what my words express.\" The defendant bought a specific article and agreed to pay $3,200 for it. The fact that the article is not as large as he thought it was does not relieve him from the necessity of paying that price. It was just such cases as this that article 1471, 1, was intended to cover. If the defendant intended to buy by the meter he should have so stated in the contract. Not only does the contract not so state, but there is no evidence in the case that the parties ever discussed at all the price which should be paid for each meter. <br/><br/>There was considerable evidence in the case concerning an agreement by the plaintiff to reduce the price and the plaintiff in answering interrogatories propounded by the defendant said that, after the objection of the defendant to carry out the contract, he did agree to make a proportional reduction. The case shows, however, that this answer and the testimony of the defendant and his witness referred to a conversation at the house of the defendant, and that this statement of the plaintiff was made when he thought that the difference was slight, not amounting to more than a meter or two, and that a proportional reduction would not decrease the price more than 20 or 30 pesos. We do not think that this admission of the defendant is sufficient of itself to prove a contract by measure in the face of the written document and the entire absence of other evidence to that end. We rather construe it as indicating a willingness on the part of the plaintiff to abate a trifle from what he was entitled to demand with the purpose of obtaining an amicable settlement of the controversy and avoiding litigation. <br/><br/>Upon the whole evidence we think the judgment below is right, and it is accordingly affirmed, with costs of this instance against the defendant. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, withdrew from this case. </div>'\n",

It is clearly proved by the testimony of Felix Labayan, Casiana Capilar, and Timoteo Unson that part of the crop of 1899 was not delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the agreement between them. The provisions of article 1575 of the Civil Code can not be so applied as to excuse this failure. That article does not refer to a contract in which the stipulated rent is an aliquot part of the crop, for example, one-fourth, as it was in this case. This failure to deliver a part of the crop was a failure to pay the rent, and therefore gave to the plaintiff the right to eject the defendant under the terms of article 1569, section 2. This action was brought for that purpose and for that alone. It was in no sense a personal action to recover the value of that part of the crop which had not been delivered. <br/><br/>The fact that this suit was brought before the termination of the crop of 1899-1900 is not important. It was not brought until after a failure by the defendant to deliver part of the crop at the time specified in the contract. The defendant’s alleged counterclaim was properly rejected for the reasons stated in the opinion of the trial court. <br/><br/>As to the suggestion made in the argument that the defendant had already abandoned the land, it is enough to say that such fact does not appear in any way from the record.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff, Sitia Teco, instituted an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the heirs of Don Balbino Ventura Hocorma, alleging in his complaint that the said Balbino Ventura Hocorma during his lifetime entered into a rental contract with the plaintiff by which a certain plot of land on Calle Santa Elena, District of Tondo, city of Manila, was let to him for the purpose of building upon it; that after the death of D. Balbino Ventura Hocorma his heirs collected the monthly rents which were due under the lease and thereby ratified the rental contract; that without just cause the defendants refused to receive the amount due for the month of February last, and are still refusing to receive the rents, and he seeks to establish against them the rental contract. The defendants deny in their answer that there was in the rental contract any provision with respect to the building by the plaintiff of a structure of any kind upon the leased premises, and deny any ratification of the rental contract from which it might be inferred that the plaintiff was to use the said premises for any particular purpose, and further state that the contract between D. Balbino Ventura y Hocorma, deceased, and the plaintiff was for no fixed term, and that in this respect the contract has not been changed by any supposed ratification; that the rent is monthly and under the provisions of article 1581 of the Civil Code the lease ceases, without the necessity of a special notice, at the expiration of the month; that under their right to terminate said lease at the end of any month they elected to do so at the end of the month and gave the plaintiff notice of such intention, and thereupon the lease was terminated. The plaintiff contends that article 1581 of the Civil Code is not applicable to such renting; that, as the lot was leased for the purpose of placing a building thereon, this provision should not apply. <br/><br/>During the pendency of the suit the plaintiff applied for a preliminary injunction on the ground, as stated in the oral argument of counsel, that the house placed by the plaintiff upon the lot having been destroyed by order of the municipality the defendants repossessed themselves of the premises and were preparing to build a house thereon. <br/><br/>Upon a trial of the case judgment was rendered against the plaintiff on the merits of the suit, and the injunction was dissolved. The plaintiff has appealed the case by a bill of exceptions and has made application to this court to restore the injunction on the ground that the operative effect of the judgment by which the injunction was dissolved has, by virtue of the appeal taken and the giving of a supersedeas bond, been lost, and that the judgment in the case should not have the effect of disturbing the interlocutory injunction. In the case of Watson &amp; Co. v. Enriquez, decided by this court October 26, 1902, it is held that an appeal from an order dissolving an injunction does not suspend the operation of the decision so as to revive the interlocutory injunction. <br/><br/>The applicant has also asked a preliminary injunction under the provisions of section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901. It does not appear, from the allegations in the complaint nor in the application for injunction, that the plaintiff had a claim to the property under the lease for any particular time. <br/><br/>There seems to be no reason why the provisions of article 1581 of the Civil Code should not be applicable to the case, and why the owners are not at liberty, as they have done in the case, to terminate the lease at the end of the month, the rent having been fixed by the month. If any equities could exist on account of the erection of a building upon the land by the plaintiff, a question upon which we express no opinion, the building having been demolished would render them ineffectual. <br/><br/>The case is stated vaguely, and the application upon which the interlocutory injunction was granted is entirely omitted from the bill of exceptions. What we understand of its contents has been gathered from the argument of counsel. <br/><br/>It may be stated also that the bill of exceptions is defective in a material respect: It does not appear from it that any exception was taken to any order, ruling, or judgment of the court. <br/><br/>Without entering into a discussion as to the circumstances under which a preliminary injunction under article 163 should be granted, after a preliminary injunction has been issued by the Court of First Instance, a full hearing had of the case on its merits, the case has been determined, the injunction dissolved, and an appeal taken to this court, it will be sufficient to say that in this case the application does not show that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief that he requests, in that his right to the possession of the property is not shown. The application will be denied and costs of the same adjudged against the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

The usual apparatus of the game was found in use, and, together with some 89 pesos in money, was seized by direction of the judge, and has been declared forfeited in the judgment under article 345 of the Penal Code, providing that  \"the money or other articles and the instruments and tools used in gambling or raffles shall be confiscated.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Antonio Acuña is admitted to have been the lessee of the premises during the period covered by the evidence, and may be held responsible as proprietor.

The act, drawn up under the authority of the judge reciting what was discovered and done at the time the premises were visited, states that Teaño was one of the players, and we find nothing in the evidence to justify the conclusion that fact was incorrectly stated. <br/><br/>The only substantial question to be determined is whether the house was a gaming house (casa de juego de suerte, envite o azar), that is,  \"a house specially devoted to the encouragement or promotion\" (dedicada al fomento o mantenimiento) of gaming. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of December 28, 1887.) <br/><br/>Mariano Nara testified that he had been in the house and had seen gambling going on there on an occasion distinct from that when the house was raided. The evidence of Ceferino M. Fontbuena is to the same effect. And Perfecto Izar, whose evidence we regard as substantially unimpeached, testified that he had been employed by Antonio Acuña to bring players to the house, receiving as compensation for his services a percentage of the profits. <br/><br/>To rebut this positive evidence, as to the character of the house, we have only the statements of a number of witnesses who, in substance, merely say that they had never heard of gambling being carried on in the house except on the evening of the raid. <br/><br/>The evidence furnished by the nature of the things found in the house by the judge also tends strongly to establish the character of the house, and on the whole we are unable to see any room for doubt that unlawful gaming was carried on there as a business by the lessee. It is true that the lessee had only occupied the house a short time when the raid occurred, but we apprehend that the length of time during which the unlawful business had continued can have no materiality when once it is shown that such business had been established on the premises. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs, and the case is remanded to that court for the execution of the judgment.

The prayer of the complaint is as follows:  \"Plaintiff prays that in accordance with the article cited (162) a preliminary injunction issue against the Municipal Board restraining it from executing or causing to be executed the aforesaid order for the demolition of the above-described tenements, until further orders; and that the heirs of D.

This motion was heard and granted on March 10. On April 12 the plaintiff presented another petition in which  \"he (the plaintiff) prays that a new preliminary injunction issue,\" etc. This petition was heard on April 15, the City Attorney appearing specially as before and objecting on the grounds, among others, that no summons or copy of the complaint in the action had ever been served on the city. In overruling this objection the court said:  \"It is unquestionably true that before the city of Manila can be required to answer or demur to the complaint in this action a copy of the same and of the summons should be served upon it; but the question now pending is an incidental issue such as that contemplated in article 168. The court has, beyond question, power to issue this preliminary injunction, without notice to the city of Manila.\" A temporary injunction was, on April 16, ordered to be issued in the same form as the preceding one. The City Attorney again appeared specially and moved to dissolve this injunction. Among other grounds he renewed those contained in his first motion, hereinbefore cited. The court, on May 20, denied the motion in the following order:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Upon reading and filing the motion presented April 19, 1902, praying for the dissolution of the preliminary injunction issued herein April 17, 1902, and the memoranda submitted by the respective parties upon the hearing of the said motion, and upon the pleadings and the record:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Ordered, That the said motion be and the same is overruled, and that the said injunction continue in force, without prejudice to the right of the defendant, the Municipal Board of the city of Manila, to move for its dissolution upon the filing of an approved bond in the sum of $2,000, Mexican currency, conditioned for the payment by the defendant to the plaintiff of all damage he may suffer by reason of the demolition of the condemned buildings should the said order be affirmed or the appeal dismissed. Dated in Manila, May 20, 1902. <br/><br/>\"ARTHUR F. ODLIN, Judge.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>On May 26 the city appealed from the order of April 16 and from the order of May 20. A bill of exceptions was allowed on June 9, and certified to this court. A motion having been made here by the plaintiff to amend the bill of exceptions, it was suggested by the court that the orders in question were not appealable. That question has been argued and is now for decision. <br/><br/>Article 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"SEC. 123. No interlocutory or incidental ruling, order, or judgment of the Court of First Instance shall stay the progress of an action or proceeding therein pending, but only such ruling, order, or judgment as finally determines the action or proceeding; nor shall any ruling, order, or judgment be the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court until final judgment is rendered for one party or the other.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant claims that the only relief prayed for was a preliminary injunction,  \"and the court having granted him all that it could grant him (art. 126) and there being nothing further to adjudicate in the case\" the order refusing to dissolve the injunction was the final judgment. The same thing could be said of the very first order made in the case on March 3, when the complaint was presented. By that order the plaintiff secured all he prayed for, and if the contention of the defendant is true that was the final judgment. The same thing could be said also of the order of March 10 dissolving the temporary injunction. There is no difference in principle between any of these orders so far as their finality is concerned. Some may have been made with more evidence before the court and after more deliberation than the others, but so far as putting an end to the litigation in the court is concerned they were equal. If the contention of the defendant is true, the court below, after the order of April 16, had no power to entertain the defendant’s motion to dissolve the injunction therein granted, for that order was the final judgment in the case. <br/><br/>It is apparent, however, that there can, in the nature of things, be no such action as one for a temporary injunction and for nothing else. A temporary injunction lasts only during the pendency of the action. When the action terminates the temporary injunction falls. If, therefore, the judge, after a hearing, should enter a final judgment granting a temporary injunction, that very act would dissolve the injunction. In this case, if the only purpose of the suit was the temporary injunction and the order of April 16 or of May 20 was the final judgment, the defendant did not need to appeal. The injunction fell with the termination of the suit, and the only effect which the defendant’s appeal against it had was to keep it alive. <br/><br/>If the only purpose of this suit was to obtain a preliminary injunction the defendant should have moved to dismiss the action, for no such suit can be maintained. <br/><br/>But it is apparent to us that the purpose of this suit was to obtain an injunction restraining the defendants until the determination of the other action between the plaintiff and the heirs of Hocorna. Whether such relief can be made the subject of an independent action or should be sought in the original action is not before us for decision, and we do not decide it. Such a suit, if it can be maintained, would be a suit for a final injunction (art. 164, 1), not for a preliminary injunction. It is true that the plaintiff has used the word  \"preliminary\" in his prayer and has not asked for other relief. But that prayer could be amended if the defendant answered, and if the defendant did not answer and no amendment could be allowed under article 126, as claimed by the defendant, the only result would be that the court would have to enter a final judgment dismissing the suit. <br/><br/>No answer has ever been made in this case, no issues of any kind have been joined. There has therefore been no trial of any issue, either of fact or law. With each motion presented by the defendant he presented various affidavits as to matters of facts. There is nothing to show that the parties ever agreed upon these facts, or ever agreed that the order of May 20 should be considered as the end of the case. If the plaintiff in his complaint had asked for a final injunction and at the same time had asked for a preliminary injunction we do not think that it would be claimed that the proceedings had below legally terminated the action. <br/><br/>It may be true that the court below has really decided the question of law in the case in passing upon these motions, and that upon the trial no new facts would be developed. That frequently happens in motions for preliminary injunctions, but it does not make an order on such a motion a final judgment. After the order of March 10 the plaintiff had a right to amend his complaint or to proceed with the case without an amendment. After the decision of April 16 and after the decision of May 20, the defendant had a right to answer, at the trial to present additional evidence and to reargue the questions of law. <br/><br/>The decision on the preliminary motion was not an adjudication of the questions there passed upon, either on the facts or the law. The order of May 20 did not finally dispose of the question there decided so far as the Court of First Instance was concerned. It still had jurisdiction and the power to enter a final judgment for the defendant after a trial on the issues raised by an answer. If it had not, every preliminary injunction would be a final one in the trial court. This proposition finds support in the case of Lalande v. McDonald, 13 Pac. R., 347 (Idaho), cited by the defendant. <br/><br/>In Weston v. City Council (2 Peters, 449), also cited by the defendant, a judgment had been entered reversing a judgment granting a writ of prohibition and ordering judgment for the defendant. It was suggested that this judgment, although it ended that particular suit, did not really finally decide whether the ordinance of the city of Charleston was void or valid, and therefore was not a  \"final\" judgment within the meaning of the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act. The court, however, said:  \"The word ’final’ must be understood in the section under consideration as applying to all judgments and decrees which determine the particular case.\" It is apparent that this case does not support the defendant’s contention, for the question here is, Has the particular suit been terminated or not?<br/><br/>In Potter v. Beal (50 Fed. R., 860) the order appealed from finally disposed of a part of the property in dispute so that it passed beyond the control of the court. Putnam, <em>J.</em>, said:  \"The order . . . seems to dispose of a part or the whole of the matter in controversy so effectually that we are forced to accept as a final decree so much as directs a distribution.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We can not agree with the majority opinion in the case of Lewis v. Campan (14 Mich., 458; 90 Am. Dic., 245), so much relied upon by the defendant, even supposing that the statutory provisions of that State are similar to ours. On the contrary, we incline to the view stated by the Chief Justice in his dissenting opinion. He said:  \"The bill was filed to remove administrators and for appointment of others, asking for the appointment of a receiver and an injunction until the final hearing. The receiver was appointed and an injunction granted upon an interlocutory motion. The final hearing has not yet been had, and the question of costs and further directions is expressly reserved until the final hearing. How this can be regarded as a final decree under the rulings in this State I am at loss to conceive.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In considering the American authorities it must be borne in mind that probably no one of the statutes therein construed contained such strong provisions against appeals from interlocutory resolutions as are found in our article 123. The evils resulting from such appeals under the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil were well known. It was to cure such evils that this article was adopted. It expressly prohibits appeals not only from interlocutory orders but also from interlocutory judgments. This prohibition is reiterated in article 143, which says:  \"Upon the rendition of final judgment disposing of the action either party shall have the right to perfect a bill of exceptions.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The appeal in this case is prohibited by these articles and it is accordingly dismissed. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Mapa, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a petition under section 499 of the Code of Procedure to compel the respondent, a judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, to sign and certify a bill of exceptions. The petitioner was the defendant in the action of Sparravohn v. Fischer, in which judgment was rendered in favor of Sparravohn on the 15th of July, 1902. It is alleged in the petition, and admitted by the answer, that an exception was taken to the judgment by the petitioner on the 28th of July, and that subsequently during the same term a bill of exceptions was presented to the judge. The judge refused to sign this bill of exceptions, and in his answer to the petition he alleges as his reason therefor  \"that there were no exceptions whatever taken by the defendant, John Fischer at any time during said trial,\" and that the exception taken to the judgment  \"was not taken forthwith, as provided by law, and not until thirteen days after the rendition of the judgment, and then not as provided by law, as said defendant filed a paper in court stating that he excepted, and excepted in no other manner whatever.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Under the Code of Procedure the only mode in which a party to an action can invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this court for the purpose of obtaining a review of an adverse ruling, order, or judgment, is by perfecting a bill of exceptions. (Sec. 143.) A refusal by the judge to sign the bill on the ground that the exceptions were not taken in due time or in due form is in effect a dismissal of the appeal. Whether a party has lost his right of appeal by his failure to comply with the requirements of the Code in these respects is a question of law, the final determination of which could logically rest with this court as a consequence of its possession of appellate jurisdiction, for if it were otherwise the trial court would have the power, by an erroneous determination of the question, to render the right of appeal in any given case altogether illusory. We think this is what is intended by the Code. Its provisions are not explicit to that effect, but we are of opinion that section 500, which regulates the whole subject of the dismissal of bills of exceptions, clearly contemplates that all questions as to whether there has been a  \"compliance with the law prescribing the method of bringing actions into the Supreme Court,\" shall be determined here, and not in the trial court. <br/><br/>A convenient course, in cases where exceptions have in fact been taken, will be for the trial court to settle and certify a bill of exceptions, embodying all the exceptions taken, and stating such facts as may be necessary in order to enable this court to pass upon the question whether they were taken in compliance with the provisions of the Code. <br/><br/>Section 142 of the Code provides that  \"the party excepting to the ruling, order, or judgment shall forthwith inform the court that he excepts to the ruling, order, or judgment.\" The word  \"forthwith,\" as here used, means within a reasonable time, which may be a longer or shorter period, according to the circumstances of each particular case. (13 Am. and Eng. Enc. of Law, 1157-1158.) Whether under the circumstances of this case a delay of thirteen days was unreasonable will be determined, if necessary, upon a motion to dismiss. <br/><br/>We do not understand that the bill of exceptions presented by the petitioner contained any other exception than that taken to the judgment. As the answer of the respondent admits that such an exception was taken, and as the truth of the bill of exceptions tendered does not appear to be denied in the answer, except as respects the question whether the exception was duly taken, an absolute mandamus should issue directing the respondent to sign and certify the bill of exceptions presented by the petitioner, adding thereto such facts as he may deem necessary in order to properly present the question whether the exception was duly taken. (Gonzaga v. Norris, decided August 26, 1902.) If, however, such bill of exceptions is incorrect in any particular the respondent may, within ten days from notice of this order, make further answer to the petition, and the case is retained for the determination of any questions which may arise on such answer. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The appellate court has exclusive power to construe the extent of its own jurisdiction. The inferior court has, accordingly, no power to decide whether an appeal lies in a particular case or whether the requirements of appellate procedure have been properly complied with. (2 Encl. Pl. and Pr., 24.) <br/><br/>Does section 142 of the Civil Code of Procedure apply to an exception taken after the trial to a final judgment? The section reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The party excepting to the ruling, order, or judgment shall forthwith inform the court that he excepts to the ruling, order, or judgment, and the judge shall thereupon minute the fact that the party has so excepted, but the trial shall not be delayed thereby. The exception shall also be recorded by the stenographer, if one is officially connected with the court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This section evidently was intended to apply to rulings made by the court in the progress of the trial, as is shown by the wording of the statute. The reason why the exception should be taken  \"forthwith\" is because such objections are orally made, and the grounds of the objection, the circumstances under which the ruling was made, and the ruling itself, rest only within the memory of the judge, and the exception should be made at the very time of the ruling in order that some memorandum or minute may be made to preserve it. It is notice to the court that the party taking it reserves for the consideration of the appellate court the ruling which he deems erroneous. This reason will not apply to a case where the exception is made in writing to the judgment. <br/><br/>It is my opinion that section 142 does not apply to this case. <br/><br/>If this section is not applicable there has been no particular time prescribed by a statute for the taking of the exception to the judgment, and in the absence of a fixed time the exception should be made within a reasonable time, which, in this character of case, would probably be held to mean at some time after the judgment and before the preparation and presentation of the bill of exceptions to the judge for his approval and signature. <br/><br/>I do not concur in the definition given to the word  \"forthwith\" used in section 142 as meaning  \"within a reasonable time.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In legal nomenclature the word  \"forthwith\" and the phrase  \"within a reasonable time\" convey quite different and distinct ideas. The word  \"forthwith\" conveys the idea that the thing to be performed must be done with the greatest diligence possible, the only lapse of time being such as may occur by the nature of the act to be performed and the amount of necessary preparation. <br/><br/>On the contrary, acts performed months after an event are in some cases regarded as done within a reasonable time, which would be utterly inconsistent with the idea conveyed by the word  \"forthwith.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The idea of a reasonable time is directly opposed to the idea of great diligence or promptitude. (Nicols v. Blackmoore, 27 Tex., 589.) <br/><br/>What effect will be given on appeal to an exception so general in its terms as is made in this case will be determined when the case reaches this court. it has been generally held that an objection or exception must be specific, and point out the very ground upon which the exception is based. </div>'\n",

Carr and three others, an order was directed to whomsoever might have them in custody requiring such person to show cause why the writ should not issue. In pursuance of this order a captain of the Marine Corps appeared and showed cause. It was proved at the hearing that these four men are marines in the service of the United States; that it was alleged that they had committed an offense which was in violation of the military laws and regulations by which that corps is governed, and that at the time the application for the writ was made they were in the guardhouse of the marines at Cavite by virtue of an order of the commanding officer of that corps at that place. These facts are sufficient to show that they are not illegally detained. <br/><br/>But it is claimed by the petitioners that the offense charged against them was a violation not only of the military law, but also of the civil law; that they had been arrested by the local police at Cavite on account thereof; that by reason of the insecurity of the local jail the civil authorities had transferred them to the Marine Corps; that they were being held by the latter awaiting trial by the civil authorities; that in the language of their counsel they were civil prisoners held by the military arm, and that no warrant for their detention had ever been issued. <br/><br/>These facts do not make their confinement illegal. When a soldier commits an offense which makes him amenable both to the civil and military law he can be tried by either. (Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S., 513; ex parte Mason, 105 U. S., 696; Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S., 115.) <br/><br/>If the military authorities have him in their possession they can turn him over to the civil courts for trial or they can try him themselves. The fact that they have agreed to surrender him to the civil courts does not deprive them of jurisdiction to try him before such surrender. <br/><br/>The marine authorities having jurisdiction to try the petitioners when this application was made their detention by such authorities was not illegal.

Estanislao Cayton orders to kill Mariano Finohermoso, who was considered to be a spy of the American Army; (3) that Ceferino Colocar protected his son, Catalino, in this matter; (4) that the other defendants are accused of having participated in some degree in the actual killing of Finohermoso, this participation consisting in the digging of the grave and the burial of Finohermoso, by order of Catalino Colocar.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It will not be necessary to decide whether in admitting the declaration of the deceased, made in the course of the preliminary investigation a few hours before his death, the court below erred, because we are of opinion that even if this evidence is to be considered as properly in the case, the defendant must be acquitted. <br/><br/>The deceased was surprised by the defendant cutting bamboo on what the latter claimed was his land. An altercation ensued between them, and the deceased received a wound which caused his death. The only evidence as to what took place offered by the prosecution was the declaration referred to and some statements by the deceased to his brother. The declaration is in such vague and general terms as to detract greatly from its value as evidence. It is in substance that the defendant found the deceased cutting bamboo as stated; that he took him to task for it, using insulting language; that the deceased replied, and that the defendant thereupon attacked him and stabbed him in the stomach with a clasp penknife. The statements made by the deceased to his brother differ somewhat from the declaration. They are to the effect that the deceased when surprised by the defendant asked his pardon, and offered to pay for the bamboo if the defendant was not willing to give it to him, but that the defendant made no reply but at once attacked him. <br/><br/>The defendant, who testified in his own behalf, gave quite a full and circumstantial account of what occurred. He says, omitting unimportant details, that he found the deceased cutting bamboo on his land; that he asked him why he was cutting such young cane; that the deceased replied in effect that it was none of his business as the land was not his; that he then threatened to arrest the deceased (the defendant being teniente of the barrio), whereupon the deceased approached him and aimed a blow at him with his bolo, which he avoided by letting himself fall from his horse; that he retreated, the deceased pursuing and striking at him with the bolo; that at last he opened his knife and put himself in an attitude of defense; that the deceased not desisting he grappled with him and succeeded in wresting the bolo from him, and that in the course of the combat he thinks he must have wounded the deceased with the knife. <br/><br/>The defendant’s account of the occurrence is corroborated to a certain extent by the evidence of two persons who witnessed the encounter from a field some four hundred yards distant, and who say they saw a man fall from his horse and another man pursue him and finally grapple with him, although they were not near enough to be able to distinguish who the men were. <br/><br/>The defendant’s testimony appears to us in effect, and especially as thus corroborated, more worthy of credence than the declaration and statements made by the deceased. At all events, in such a conflict of evidence we should not be justified in rejecting it as untrue. <br/><br/>Accepting the defendant’s statement as true, it is clear that he was acting in the legitimate exercise of his right to defend himself by repelling the unprovoked and wrongful attack of the defendant, and is therefore relieved from responsibility under No. 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the defendant is acquitted, with costs of both instances de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Smith, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Thomas E. Kepner, an attorney-at-law, was charged in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila with the crime of estafa, alleged to have been committed by him by indorsing a warrant of the Insular Government made payable to his client, Aun Tan, and collecting and appropriating to his own use the amount due thereon without the authority or consent of the latter. <br/><br/>The accused was tried on the charge and after hearing the evidence of both sides the trial judge was of the opinion that there was evidence tending to show that the appropriation of the amount of the warrant was made under a bona fide claim of right. He therefore acquitted the defendant and the fiscal appealed. <br/><br/>Wong Cheong and Aun Tan, Chinese bakers, were charged before a military commission with illegally having in their possession some four hundred sacks of commissary flour, the property of the United States, against the statute and military regulations in such cases made and provided. On March 24, 1901, while they were in confinement, O. C. Hing, a Chinese friend of the parties, retained Kepner to obtain their release on bail and to defend them before the military court. It was agreed that the attorney should receive for his professional services $300, Mexican, cash, and $700, Mexican, additional on condition that he save Wong Cheong and Aun Tan from fine or imprisonment, and secured the release of the flour which had been seized by the authorities. After obtaining the release of his clients on $3,000, Mexican, bail and taking their statements, Kepner came to the conclusion on the 1st of May, 1901, that both were guilty of the offense with which they were charged and that in no event would he be able to procure a release of the flour. He therefore told the accused Chinamen as well as Hing  \"that it was absolutely out of the question to stand by the original agreement,\" and offered to return the $300 which had been already paid. He finally allowed himself, however, to be persuaded to continue with the case for a consideration, which he says was an unconditional fee of $500 payable on the determination of the cause. Hing says no agreement for an unconditional fee was ever made. His story is that after Aun Tan had been released on bail Kepner declared that he could not get the flour back and proposed that contingency should be eliminated from their understanding. To this proposition Hing consented and Kepner agreed to secure Wong Cheong and Aun Tan against fine or imprisonment for the sum of $500 in addition to what he had previously received. The trial of the two men took place about the 4th of May, 1901, and resulted in the acquittal of Wong Cheong and the conviction of Aun Tan, who was fined $1,000, gold, and paid it. <br/><br/>On the 9th of May Kepner sent Hing a bill  \"for services in re the United States v. Wong Cheong and Aun Tan, as per agreement, $500.\" Hing flatly refused to pay the account on the ground that Aun Tan had been fined and that there was nothing due under the terms of the contract. On June 20 Kepner apparently yielded the point, for on that date he borrowed from Hing, his alleged debtor, $150, which he promised to repay on or before the 20th of July next ensuing. This he would scarcely have done if Hing had been indebted to him at the time in the sum of $500 for services which he asserted had been then fully completed. <br/><br/>On the 1st of July, 1901, Hing went to the office of Kepner and asked him to make an effort to get the fine remitted and the confiscated flour returned. Hing says Kepner agreed to obtain the restoration of the fine and the flour for the sum of $1,000, Mexican. Kepner says he agreed to get back the fine for a consideration of $500, Mexican, and  \"that no agreement had been reached on the flour proposition\" nor anything said on the subject beyond a conversation touching the making of an application for its recovery, and an offer on his part to do the work for $500. Kepner presented his petition for a remission of the fine, but before it had been acted upon officially, so far as appears from the evidence, he again made a demand on Hing for money, which was refused. Considering, however, that the appellant had obtained the acquittal of Wong Cheong, Hing offered to allow him $250 in settlement of the second contract, and the offer would appear to have been finally and definitely accepted by Kepner in his letter of the 12th of August, 1901, in which he says:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Dear Mr. Hing: I am surprised that you should say that you only owe me $250, but until the fine is returned I will let it go that way. <br/><br/>\"I have received from you\t$150.00<br/><br/>\"Clothes\t36.00<br/><br/>\"Balance due on collections\t21.25<br/><br/>_______<br/><br/>207.25<br/><br/>\"Balance due me\t42.75<br/><br/>\"Please pay balance of $42.75 to Mr. Denmark, and oblige,<br/><br/>\"Yours, respectfully, etc.,<br/><br/>\"THOMAS E. KEPNER.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The sum of $42.75 was paid by Hing as directed by this letter, and on the 12th of August, 1901, all sums then due from Hing to Kepner had been paid, and Hing so understood it. <br/><br/>Two days later, namely, on the 14th of August, 1901, although he had not yet received the return of the fine, Kepner notified Hing that the military authorities had remitted the fine and requested him to call the next day  \"and pay his bill in this case, amounting as per agreement to $750, Mexican currency,\" apparently reviving his claim under the second contract and adding $500 for an alleged completion of the third contract. Hing refused to pay, saying that nothing was due or would become due until the fine and the flour were recovered. <br/><br/>On the 24th of August Kepner received $200 from Hing as a loan, according to the latter, as a payment on the second contract, according to the former. How anything could have become due in view of the settlement of August 12, 1901, and in view of the fact that the fine had not been repaid, does not appear. <br/><br/>Although the fine was remitted and an order made for its return, Kepner found that the money had been turned into the Insular Treasury, and that he could not get it without an act of the Commission authorizing its payment. The mere fact that this formal act of the Commission was required to get money out of the Treasury caused Kepner, if he is to be believed, to despair of ever recovering the fine, and he threw up the case. According to his account he was induced to take it up again, however, for a consideration, to wit, 50 per cent of the amount recovered, which he says Hing agreed to pay. Hing says he did nothing of the kind. However that may be, the appellant wrote a letter to General Chaffee, asking to refer the matter to the Commission for an appropriation bill, and on the 20th of September a warrant in favor of Aun Tan for $1,000, gold, was drawn on the Insular Treasury by the Civil Governor and countersigned by the Auditor. The Treasurer, on the face of the warrant, executed an order to the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China to pay the warrant, and the same was then delivered to Kepner. Kepner requested Aun Tan to either indorse it or give him power to cash it, and Aun Tan positively refused to comply. Kepner then told Hing that he would put the warrant in his safe until they could reach some agreement. On the 23d of September the following letter was written to Hing by Kepner:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Mr. O. C. Hing,<br/><br/>\"Calle Magallanes, No. 19, Intramuros. <br/><br/>\"My Dear Sir: I have to inform you that if you do not settle your account with me before Tuesday noon (September 24) or indorse the draft I hold I shall sue you and forclose my lien on the draft. <br/><br/>\"Yours respectfully, etc.,<br/><br/>\"THOMAS E. KEPNER.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>On the very same day, September 23, without waiting until the following day, as indicated in his letter, Kepner, in the very teeth of Aun Tan’s refusal to indorse the draft or to authorize its collection, wrote Aun Tan’s name on the back of it by himself as attorney, presented it to the bank, represented that he had a power of attorney to make the indorsement, and had the full amount of the warrant credited to his account. He would not say that this account then amounted to more than $5.40. <br/><br/>On the very same day, September 23, without waiting until the following day, as indicated in his letter, Kepner, in the very teeth of Aun Tan’s refusal to indorse the draft or to authorize its collection, wrote Aun Tan’s name on the back of it by himself as attorney, presented it to the bank, represented that he had a power of attorney to make the indorsement, and had the full amount of the warrant credited to his account. He would not say that this account then amounted to more than $5.40. <br/><br/>On the very same 23d day of September, exclusive of the check to Hing, he drew checks against the $1,000, gold, or $2,000, Mexican, so credited to him, for more than $1,217.50, Mexican, to pay personal bills, so that on the 24th of September, when he handed Hing a check for $450, Mexican, and his receipted bill for $1,550, Mexican, the whole $2,000, Mexican, had not only been actually appropriated but more than $1,200, Mexican, of the sum had been actually expended by Kepner in payment of personal accounts. <br/><br/>The sums paid by Hing to Kepner were $300 retainer on the first contract, $250 for the acquittal of Wong Cheong under the second contract, and $200 advanced on the third contract for the return of the fine and the flour — $750 in all. According to Kepner there accrued to him $300 for his retainer on the first contract, $500 under the second contract which he claims was unconditional, $1,000 for having secured the return of the fine, and $500 for having attempted to obtain the redelivery of the flour, which feat, he says, he knew could not be accomplished, and for the doing of which, he says, he never had any understanding whatever with either Hing, Wong Cheong or Aun Tan — $2,300 in all. He admits receiving from Hing the sum of $750, leaving a balance of $1,550, which he paid to himself by cashing the warrant and crediting the entire proceeds to his account. That is to say, Kepner’s charges for services amounted to $300 more than the whole amount of the fine. <br/><br/>The appellant’s account of his transactions with his clients is such that his credit as a witness is wholly destroyed as to the disputed facts of the case. His own story shows him to be a man lacking in principle and wholly unworthy of the honorable profession to which he unfortunately belongs. He may have been entirely right in canceling his first contract to defend the accused Chinamen for a retainer of $300 and $700 additional, contingent on the result. But why did he wait from March 24 until May 1, the eve of the trial, before doing so? Was it to diminish the chance of the engagement of other counsel and so force his clients to accept such terms as he might offer? He may not have been actuated by any such motive, but in view of his subsequent conduct it smacks of it. The circumstances may have justified his agreeing for a fee of $500 to obtain a return of the fine which had been justly imposed on Aun Tan, whom he knew to be guilty, but what is his justification for breaking his agreement in the very moment of success and forcing his clients to agree to pay double his fee for the very same service? Why did he state to Hing after the fine had been remitted by competent authority that he could not recover the money when all that remained to be done was a mere authorization of the Commission which would have been conceded, as it was, for the bare asking? Was it to give him an excuse to extort from his clients an additional fee of $500 for the very trivial service of writing a letter to General Chaffee asking him to notify the Commission that the fine had been remitted in order that an appropriation bill might be passed enabling the withdrawal of the money from the Insular Treasury? What right did he have to collect $500 for endeavoring to obtain a return of the confiscated flour, a charge which he admits was for a service impossible of accomplishment and wholly unwarranted by any understanding whatever with his clients? But if he can fairly explain all this, under what rule of law or morals does he justify his act of representing to the bank that he had authority from Aun Tan to collect the insular warrant when he knew that such authority had been definitely, positively, and expressly refused?<br/><br/>Kepner’s own testimony justifies the court in concluding that he sought to take a grossly unfair advantage of a confidential relation, and that he is unworthy of credence. <br/><br/>The second agreement, as testified to by Hing, is therefore accepted by the court and Kepner’s account as to that agreement and the subsequent agreements is rejected. Considering that all he accomplished for his clients was to save them from fine or imprisonment in conformity with the second contract, and considering that he was paid $750 for the service, there only remained $50 due him at the time he cashed the warrant. He therefore unlawfully misappropriated $1,500, viewing the case from the standpoint that the money was the money of Aun Tan and giving Kepner credit for the $450 check delivered to Hing. But if we admit the truth of all that the accused says, if we forget that he took out of the warrant $500 for services rendered to secure the flour without either contract, agreement, or understanding with his clients to justify it, if we concede that in all his transactions with Aun Tan he acted in good faith, he is nevertheless guilty of the crime of estafa. <br/><br/>The warrant delivered into his hands, drawn by the Insular Government in favor of Aun Tan on the chartered Bank, was the property of Aun Tan, but the money which it represented was not, until it had been delivered to the bank for payment, properly and legally indorsed by Aun Tan, or by his authority. Aun Tan had no money in the bank and no monetary loss was inflicted on him by illegally cashing his warrant. The injury to him was the delay, annoyance, and damage caused by the unlawful misappropriation of the warrant. In a word, the bank would have been compelled to pay Aun Tan the amount of the warrant, notwithstanding a previous payment to Kepner. <br/><br/>If this be so, on the undisputed facts in the case the defendant withdrew from the Chartered Bank and appropriated to his own use $2,000, Mexican, of its funds by representing to the bank that he had a power and authority which he did not possess, and that constitutes the crime of estafa under the provisions of article 535, subdivision 1, of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The allegation of the complaint that the unlawful misappropriation of the proceeds of the warrant was to the prejudice of Aun Tan may be disregarded by virtue of section 7 of General Orders, No. 58, which declares that when an offense shall have been described in the complaint with sufficient certainty to identify the act, an erroneous allegation as to the person injured shall be deemed immaterial. In any event the defect, if defect it was, was one of form which did not tend to prejudice any substantial right of the defendant on the merits, and can not, therefore, under the provisions of section 10 of the same order, affect the present proceeding. <br/><br/>It has been stipulated between the appellant and the fiscal that certain affidavits may be considered as evidence on the review and examination of the record by this court on appeal. These affidavits show that Kepner on the 12th of October, 1901, after the question of the validity of his indorsement had been called to his attention by the bank, volunteered to make good to the bank any deficiency which might exist between his account and the amount of the warrant, and that to make this amount good he deposited with the bank, after his arrest and on the 30th of October, 1901, $2,000, Mexican. The affidavits further show that on the 10th of May, 1902, he effected a full, voluntary, and satisfactory settlement with his client of all financial differences. <br/><br/>His promise to return the money about the time he was threatened with arrest, and his subsequent return of it after his arrest, as well as the settlement of his financial differences with his clients, constitute no defense to the crime, which, if committed at all by him, was committed on the 23d of September, 1901. Restitution is not even an attenuating circumstance under article 9 of the Penal Code. It is a matter to be considered solely by the Executive in the exercise of the pardoning power. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court acquitting the defendant is reversed with costs against the <em>Respondent</em>. <br/><br/>Taking into consideration all the evidence in the case the court finds:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>First. That the defendant received on the 21st of September, 1901, from the Insular Government for the use and benefit and as the property of his client a certain warrant drawn in favor of said Aun Tan for the sum of $1,000, gold, which the Insular Treasurer, by proper order on its face, directed the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China to pay to said Aun Tan. <br/><br/>Second. That said defendant, against the will and without the consent of said Aun Tan, wrote the name of Aun Tan by himself as attorney on the back of said warrant and presented the same to the said bank for payment. <br/><br/>Third. That he represented and stated to said bank that he had a power of attorney from Aun Tan to make such indorsement, and that his representation and statement to that effect to the bank was false and untrue, as he, the said defendant, well knew when he made it. <br/><br/>Fourth. that in consequence of said unauthorized indorsement by the defendant and his aforesaid false representation and statement to the bank said warrant was cashed, and the whole amount thereof, $2,000, Mexican, credited to appellant’s personal account in said bank on the 23d of September, 1901. <br/><br/>Fifth. That afterwards, and on said 23d of September, 1901, defendant used of said sum so credited to his said account more than $1,217.50, Mexican, and possibly $1,337.50, Mexican, for the payment of personal bills and expenses. <br/><br/>Sixth. That on the 24th of September, 1901, defendant delivered to O. C. Hing for Aun Tan his personal check on said bank for $450, and his receipted bill of $1,550 for services rendered, but that said check was never cashed by Aun Tan nor was said bill for $1,550 accepted as correct or just. <br/><br/>Seventh. That neither on the 23d of September, 1901, nor on the 24th of the same month and year was any greater sum due from said Aun Tan to said defendant than the sum of $50, Mexican. <br/><br/>Taking into consideration the provisions of article 534, article 535, Nos. 1 and 5, and article 58 of the Penal Code, the court finds as a conclusion of law from the foregoing facts that the defendant, Thomas E. Kepner, willfully, illegally, fraudulently, and feloniously misappropriated and converted to his own use said warrant and the sum of money which he collected thereon, and that he is guilty of the crime estafa within the intent and meaning of article 535, subdivisions 1 and 5, of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Wherefore, by reason of the law in such cases made and provided and the articles of the Penal Code above cited, the court orders and adjudges that the defendant, Thomas E. Kepner, be, and he is hereby, condemned to one year eight months and twenty-one days of presidio correccional, and to the suspension from every public office, profession, trade, and right of suffrage, with costs. <br/><br/>Taking into consideration that the amount collected on the warrant was returned to the bank on the 30th of October, 1901, and that all financial differences between the defendant and Aun Tan were finally amicably settled in May, 1902, no judgment for the return of the money is made, but it is ordered and adjudged that the warrant which forms a part of the record herein be returned to Aun Tan and that the clerk attach to the record a duly certified copy of said warrant in lieu thereof.

Norris, August 26, 1902. <br/><br/>No motion for a new trial having been made this court can not weigh the evidence nor retry the questions of fact. Consequently the testimony of the witnesses has no place in this bill of exceptions except so far as it is necessary to explain the exceptions that were taken and their relevancy. So far as we can ascertain, no exception was taken which requires for its elucidation in any one of the fifteen documents presented by the plaintiff, except document fourteen. They were all received in evidence and there is no exception relating to any of them. The first bill of exceptions proposed by the appellant contains in detail the evidence of many witnesses who testified without objection or exception on the part of the plaintiff. This evidence was properly excluded from the bill of exceptions. The proposed bill contains also the plaintiff’s opening statement as to what the facts of the case were. This was properly excluded. Eight pages are also devoted to a legal argument against the judgment. This has no place in any bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>All of the exceptions contained in the plaintiff’s proposed bill are in the bill signed by the judge. It is of no consequence who prepared the bill. If it is a correct and full statement of the exceptions, the fact that it was prepared by the adverse party or by the court is not important. It appears, however, that the bill prepared by the plaintiff and the amendments prepared by the defendant were discussed and considered by the court and both counsel at a session held for the purpose of setting the bill. <br/><br/>There was no error committed by the judge as to the points mentioned. But in other respects the bill signed by him is incomplete. Article 143 requires the bill of exceptions to state enough of the evidence to show the relevancy of the exceptions and the bearing which the answer excepted to has on the case. <br/><br/>In most of the exceptions, from No. 3 to No. 18, inclusive, in the bill as allowed this is not done. The judge limited himself to stating the question and his reasons for overruling the objection. Supposing that those reasons were insufficient, there remains only the question with no answer and nothing to show the connection of the question with the other testimony in the case or the issues therein. Exception No. 14 is an example of how the exceptions are stated. It is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"No. 14. The defendant or cross-examination asked a witness for the plaintiff the following question: ’Do you know if your brother sowed sugar-cane in the Rosario estate the year nineteen hundred?’ The plaintiff objected; the court overruled the objection on the ground that the question was pertinent; the plaintiff took exception.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The bill of exceptions signed by the judge should be amplified by adding to the several exceptions the evidence contained in the indicated pages in the first bill of exceptions presented by the plaintiff. If such evidence is not truly stated in said bill, the court will make the necessary corrections so as to make it conform to the truth. <br/><br/>The additions are as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>To exception No. 3, so much of the evidence of Feliciano Alintara as is contained on page 17 of the first bill of exceptions tendered by the plaintiff. <br/><br/>To exception No. 14, all of the testimony of Pedro Saison on page 33 of said bill. <br/><br/>To exceptions Nos. 15 and 18, all of the evidence of Inocente Idemne on pages 33 and 34 of said bill. <br/><br/>To exception No. 16, all of the evidence of Flaviano Alintara on pages 34, 35, and 36 of said bill. <br/><br/>To exception No. 17, all the testimony of Benedicto Tanigue on page 36 and on page 37 of same bill to the answer to the question objected to. <br/><br/>To exceptions 8, 9, and 10, all the testimony of Aquilino Saosas on pages 38 and 39 of said bill. <br/><br/>To exceptions Nos. 12 and 13, document No. 14, and the testimony of Feliciano Alintara on pages 39, 40 and 41 of said bill. <br/><br/>To exception No. 7, the testimony of Inocente Idemne on page 11 of the so-called extract of the said bill. <br/><br/>The exceptions relating to the jurisdiction of the court and the challenge of the judge and those numbered 19, 20, and 21 are sufficiently stated. We do not find in the plaintiff’s bill exceptions Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 11. <br/><br/>The respondent in this proceeding is directed to correct the bill of exceptions as hereinbefore indicated and sign and certify the same. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

It was carried on under the law then in force until June 15, 1900, on which date the defendant filed a formal objection to the complaint. After that date nothing was done until May 27, 1902, when the plaintiff filed a petition in which he alleged that the proceeding was being carried on under the Code of Civil Procedure, and in which he asked that a demand for payment he made upon the defendant and that if he did not pay in the act, his property be seized. The judge of the Special Court of Negros cited the parties to a trial and after receiving documentary and oral evidence, none of which appears in the record, he made a decision which recited the proceedings had in that case. States that the defendant has not proved the illegality of the claim of the plaintiff and orders judgment in favor of the latter. From this judgment said court allowed an appeal in both effects and directed the original records to be sent here. <br/><br/>If this case was tried before the special court in accordance with the old procedure the evidence should have been returned to this court. If tried according to the new procedure the decision should have conformed to article 133, and the judge should have required the settlement of a bill of exceptions and should not have sent the original record here. Viewed as a decision under the present Code it is entirely insufficient to support the judgment, and if the new Code is to be applied it should be reversed for that reason. <br/><br/>There are, however, more indications that the court was pursuing the old procedure than that he was pursuing the new. <br/><br/>In accordance with that procedure the evidence should have been preserved and returned to this court. It is impossible for us to pass upon the merits of the case without it. <br/><br/>The case of Gonzaga v. Canete, April l, 1902, appealed from the same court, came in here in the same condition as this case. It was only by virtue of an agreement between the parties in that case that we passed upon certain questions of law presented by the record. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Court of First Instance for Occidental Negros for a new trial. <br/><br/>In view of the fact that the defendant removed the case here knowing as he must have known how incomplete the record was, and of the further fact that this defect was not suggested by him until the argument of the case, the costs of the appeal are charged against him. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

In consequence the judgment appealed was declared a finality. The appellant, Manuel Brillantes, upon the day following the service upon him in his residence of notice of the order, service having been made by the judge of Abra, filed a petition asking for the vacation of the said order, and that he be allowed the term of twenty days or more provided for by article 370 of the old Code of Civil Procedure, for the purpose of coming to an understanding with Solicitor Santos, or some other solicitor, to represent him before this court. Among other grounds he alleged that he was prevented from prosecuting the appeal by force majeure, to wit, by war, and that the term prescribed by article 394 of the law cited had not expired when the force majeure ceased, and that therefore he considered himself entitled to avail himself of the remedy prescribed by article 399 of the same law. <br/><br/>The petitioner has not proven, nor has he even offered to prove, that he was prevented from prosecuting his appeal before the expiration of the term of two years by force majeure, or by any cause independent of his own will. For this reason his application, brought conformably to the provisions of articles 395, 399, and 400 of the Code of Civil Procedure, must be overruled, and consequently the vacation of the order prayed for by Manuel Brillantes in his petition of September 20 last is denied, with the costs.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">An action was regularly brought in the Court of First Instance by Ang Ban Ka against Dy Chuan Leng and Lee Gu. <br/><br/>The object of the action was to dissolve a partnership alleged by the plaintiff to exist between the plaintiff and defendants. <br/><br/>There was a prayer in the complaint for a preliminary injunction and the appointment of a receiver. A preliminary injunction was granted ex parte and a motion to dissolve it denied. <br/><br/>The defendants demurred to the complaint. This demurrer is still pending decision. <br/><br/>The court below has notified the defendants that he intends to appoint a receiver. <br/><br/>The said defendants have now filed in this court a complaint under article 516, Code of Civil Procedure, asking that the judge of Part 3, in which the said action is pending, be prohibited from continuing the preliminary injunction, and from appointing a receiver. The petitioners ask also for an injunction in accordance with article 518. <br/><br/>We can not grant an injunction under this section unless there is a compliance with articles 164 and 166. <br/><br/>It must appear from the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the action. If the complaint states no cause of action no preliminary injunction can be issued. The complaint filed in this court is defective in this respect. It shows upon its face that the petitioners are not entitled to an order of prohibition against the court below. That court had jurisdiction of the action to dissolve the partnership. In that action it had the power to grant a preliminary injunction (article 164), and to appoint a receiver (article 174). Having those powers, if in the exercise of them any errors were committed, they could be corrected only on appeal from the final judgment. The facts as alleged, that the complaint was ambiguous; that the judge believed that the plaintiff below was a partner when the defendants denied it; that he fixed the bond at $1,000 instead of $30,000, as requested by the defendants; that no mention of the bond was made in the writ of injunction; that he refused to hear the defendants’ witnesses; that he refused to dissolve the injunction upon a bond which the defendants offered to give, all of these do not show that the court was acting outside of its jurisdiction. They simply show, if they are true, that the court has committed certain errors in exercising its jurisdiction, errors which must be corrected by appeal. (Re Prautch, February 14, 1902). <br/><br/>In the case of Yangco v. Rohde, October 13, 1902, we denied a writ of prohibition on the ground that in no case, where the fact of marriage was denied did the Court of First Instance have any jurisdiction to grant temporary alimony. That case differs radically from this one. <br/><br/>It is of course apparent that in passing upon this preliminary motion, we have virtually decided the case upon the present complaint. We see, however, no escape from that result. <br/><br/>The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant was convicted by the court below of the offense of lesiones menos graves under article 418 of the Code. We are of opinion that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the conviction. <br/><br/>The first paragraph of article cited fixes the general rule for the punishment of the offense, which is to be by  \"arresto mayor, or destierro and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas in the discretion of the court.\" The second paragraph makes an exception of cases where the injury is inflicted  \"with manifest intent of outrage or under humiliating circumstances;\" in these cases the punishment is to be by arresto mayor and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas. In the present case the conviction was under the first paragraph, and the evidence would not have warranted a conviction under the second. The penalty imposed was two months and one day of arresto mayor and a fine of 325 pesetas. <br/><br/>The two alternative penalties which may be imposed under the first paragraph are (1) arresto mayor and (2) destierro and a fine. The fine can not be imposed as a part of the first alternative penalty. Such is the construction of the clause indicated by the punctuation, which in the case of a carefully prepared Code is entitled to considerable weight, and such is the construction which has been placed upon the same clause in the corresponding article of the Code of Spain by the highest judicial authority of that country, judgment in cassation of January 12, 1875. See also to the same effect 3 Viada, Commentaries on the Penal Code of Spain, 86; 4 Groizard, Commentaries on the Penal Code of Spain, 565. The court erred, therefore, in the present case in imposing a fine in addition to the imprisonment. <br/><br/>The court also erred in not determining in the judgment the civil liability of the defendant for the daños and perjuicios which resulted from the criminal act. Such civil liability is a necessary consequence of criminal responsibility (Penal Code, article 17), and is to be declared and enforced in the criminal proceeding except where the injured party reserves his right to avail himself of it in a distinct civil action. (Code of Criminal Procedure of Spain, article 112; Provisional Law for the Application of the Penal Code in the Philippines, article 51, No. 4.) No such waiver or reservation is disclosed by the record here. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below must therefore be modified as respects the penalty imposed by eliminating the fine; and there should be added a declaration that the defendant is entitled to indemnification in the sum of 5 pesos for the perjuicios which resulted from his inability to work for ten days in consequence of the assault, together with such sum as he may be able to prove that he has expended for medical attendance. <br/><br/>As thus modified the judgment will be affirmed, and case remanded to the court below for the execution thereof.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Case No. 47 was commenced in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo on June 23, 1901, upon a complaint filed by Cirilo Mapa, attorney at law, charging Francisca Zulueta and her husband, Joaquin Fernandez Herrerias, with the crime of calumny. The defendants appeared before the court, and, having been arraigned upon the charge, on the 13th of August filed in due form a demurrer to the information. Upon this the private prosecutor filed an answer, and, without further proceedings by the provincial fiscal, who was duly notified, the incident was decided by an order dated the 4th of November, 1901, by which the demurrer of the defendants was overruled, and, in accordance with the provisions of section 24 of General Orders, No. 58, the defendants were directed to plead to the charge at the day and hour designated. <br/><br/>On the 4th of November, 1901, the attorney for the defendants moved the court to dismiss the information, upon the ground, among others, that the same was presented by a person not authorized to represent the United States, and not a party to the proceedings; that the action had not been prosecuted by the provincial fiscal, and had been abandoned, inasmuch as he had failed to make reply within three days to the demurrer and the argument in support thereof filed by the defendants. <br/><br/>The court below, by an order of the same date, November 4, 1901, after service of notice upon the provincial fiscal and upon the private prosecutor, ordered the parties to appear on the morning of the 8th of November. The hearing took place on that day, and after oral argument by the attorney for the defendants, the private prosecutor, and the provincial fiscal, on the 23d of November the order appealed from was entered. <br/><br/>By the order of the 4th of November the court below overruled the demurrer of the defendants to the information upon which this prosecution was instituted. The judge could not subsequently enter an order of dismissal, and order the answer filed by the private prosecutor against the demurrer to be excluded because he considered that the provincial fiscal had abandoned the prosecution of the case. <br/><br/>The fact that the provincial fiscal did not reply to the demurrer taken by the attorney for the defendants was not sufficient ground to authorize the dismissal of the case, because as the demurrer was overruled by the order referred to, the prosecution of the case should have been continued and the defendants ordered to plead, in accordance with section 24 of General Orders, No. 58, dated April 23, 1900, as was expressly directed by the order referred to of November 4. <br/><br/>It is necessary to hold constantly in mind the provisions of section 107 of General Orders No. 58, when considering the rights of the party injured by the commission of the offense, and further that all public offenses tried before the Courts of First Instance must be prosecuted by complaint or information, in accordance with section 3 of the general order cited. As the private prosecutor, Cirilo Mapa, filed a complaint in his capacity as the party injured and entitled to take part in the prosecution of the crime of which the defendants are charged, and for the purpose of enforcing against them their civil liability, it is evident that the case was properly commenced by the filing of the said complaint. <br/><br/>There was no abandonment of the penal action by the provincial fiscal, as it appears from the record that since the preliminary investigation was had that officer has constantly participated in the prosecution, and that notice was served upon him of the order overruling the demurrer, and that notice was served upon him of the orders made by the judge for the prosecution of the case. This, apart from the petition filed by him, and which appears on page 10 of the record, and the fact that he was present when the defendants appeared, and that he addressed the court at the time they were arraigned in the hearing upon the motion, and that he joined the private prosecutor in his appeal to this court against the order referred to. If the provincial fiscal failed to answer in writing to the demurrer filed by the attorney for the defendants, this was possibly due to the fact that no copy of the demurrer, or of the argument in support of it, was served upon him, and in the order on page 30 of the record the judge did nothing more than to direct that notice of the order be served upon the provincial fiscal. But however that may be, the failure on the part of the fiscal to so reply or answer would under no circumstances be sufficient to authorize the dismissal of the prosecution, or to support the conclusion that the representative of the Government had abandoned the case, when several other acts of that officer demonstrate the contrary; further more, section 38 authorizes the appointment of a practicing attorney to perform the duties of the fiscal, should he be absent during the trial. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds, therefore, we are of the opinion that the order of the 23rd of November, 1901, should be reversed, and that the case should be returned to the court below for a continuation of the prosecution, in accordance with the procedural law. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> Cooper, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. </div>'\n",

From the decision of the Court of First Instance the Government has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>We will not attempt to review the judgment of the Court of First Instance in making this order, in view of the conclusion which we reach, that this court has no jurisdiction over the appeal. <br/><br/>The Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, is divided into two parts — Part I relating to civil actions and Part II to special proceedings. The difference between the procedure in civil actions and in special proceedings relates, principally, to the powers of the judge or court. <br/><br/>Under this classification various proceedings have been denominated as special proceedings, such as the appointment of guardians, trusts and trustees, wills and allowances thereof, the settlement of estates of deceased persons, etc., and among them proceedings in <em>habeas corpus</em>. <br/><br/>All civil actions are brought to this court by bill of exceptions, while special proceedings are brought here by the procedure denominated  \"appeals in special proceedings.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Chapter 42 of the Code of Civil Procedure regulates these appeals and specifically provides for the different classes of cases appealable. <br/><br/>Thus, section 773 provides for an appeal from an allowance or disallowance of a claim. <br/><br/>Section 778, for appeals from the settlement of account of administrators, executors, trustees, or guardians. <br/><br/>Section 781, for appeals in case of allowance or disallowance of wills. <br/><br/>Sections 782, for appeals from decree of distribution, and finally,<br/><br/>Sections 783 regulates appeals in other cases affecting settlement of estates. <br/><br/>We also find in section 772 an appeal allowed in cases of adoption and custody of minors. <br/><br/>It will be seen by an examination of these sections the right to appeal is given in every character of special proceedings except the special proceeding of <em>habeas corpus</em>. It has not been deemed proper that appeals should be taken in this character of proceeding, as is evident by the failure to make provision for such appeal. <br/><br/>For those wishing to avail themselves of the benefit of <em>habeas corpus</em> there would be no necessity of an appeal to the Supreme Court because they have the right to make application direct to the Supreme Court for the issuance of the writ. <br/><br/>It is true that the act of a judge of the Court of First Instance in discharging a defendant committed under sentence of another court, under a mistaken view of the law as to jurisdiction, might be quite serious, but the legislative power has not seen proper to provide the Government with the remedy of appeal in such cases and we can not furnish one. <br/><br/>The appeal in this case is therefore dismissed with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

Smith suspected him of the larceny, and accused him of it in the presence of an officer of the Constabulary and another person. Sotelo at first denied his guilt, but upon the officer threatening to have him arrested he requested a private interview with Smith and, according to the latter’s testimony, made a full confession to him. <br/><br/>If Smith’s evidence as to the confession were uncorroborated, we might possibly regard it as unsafe to convict. But it is admitted that subsequent to this interview with Smith, and after the initiation of criminal proceedings against him, Sotelo sent several telegrams to the manager of the firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. in Manila, in which he asked for pardon and mercy, and that the prosecution be withdrawn and the affair concealed from his family, and promised restitution. <br/><br/>The ingenious argument of counsel for the defense utterly fails to convince us that this conduct is reconcilable with the hypothesis of innocence. <br/><br/>The evidence in the record discloses other circumstances pointing to the defendant’s guilt, to which we need not advert. We regard the evidence as to the verbal confession, corroborated as it is by the telegrams, as amply sufficient to sustain the conviction. <br/><br/>There were no aggravating or extenuating circumstances and the court below erred in applying the penalty in the minimum instead of the medium grade.

That court finds one aggravating circumstance to be present, which is stated to be  \"the fact of the robbery committed at the same time as the murder.\" This supposed aggravating circumstance the court compensates with the circumstance of article 11 of the Code, that of race, considered as extenuating, with the result that the defendants have been sentenced to cadena perpetua, which is the medium grade of the penalty assigned to the crime of murder. <br/><br/>The following facts are established by uncontradicted evidence: The deceased, Elias Acogido, his wife, Benita Baldilosa, and their two sons, one 17 and the other 21 years old, residents of the pueblo of Bacarra in Ilocos Norte, were awakened early in the morning of December 3, 1901, by the voice of a man outside their house calling to the deceased. Benita answered that her husband was not in the house. Immediately thereafter five men entered the house, seized the deceased, who had hidden behind a door, and dragged him downstairs. Three of the men were armed with clubs, one had a bolo, and the other a dagger. At the foot of the stairs they all fell upon the deceased, beating him with the clubs and inflicting four wounds upon his head and face with the bolo and dagger, two of which were of a mortal character. They then carried him upstairs to the batalan, where they beat him again and choked him. They then allowed his wife to take him into the house. Three of them also went into the house and demanded money from the woman. She replied that she had none, whereupon they proceeded to search the upper part of the house while the other two did the same in the lower part, but they found nothing and went away without having taken anything. The deceased died in six days in consequence of the injuries received. <br/><br/>Benita and the two sons identified the defendants, who lived in the same pueblo as themselves, and whom they had known previously, as the men who entered the house and assaulted the deceased. Their evidence was corroborated by that of three witnesses, neighbors of the deceased, who testified that on the night in question they went to the house for the purpose of rendering assistance, but instead of going in at first concealed themselves in the bushes in the yard, and from their hiding place saw the robbers as they left the house and recognized them as the defendants. <br/><br/>Each one of the defendants undertook to establish an alibi. Six witnesses testified that they were in the house of the defendant Santiago during the entire night in question, taking case of the latter’s brother, who was lying at the point of death, and that Santiago did not leave the house at all during the night. Three witnesses testified that they were in the house of the defendant. Acosta during the entire night, Acosta’s concubine being sick, and that Acosta was there all night. Four witnesses testified that they were in the house where the defendants Ceferino and Benito Rumbaoa lived, the entire night, and that those defendants were there all night taking care of a sick daughter of Benito. Two witnesses testified that they were with the defendant Carlos Rumbaoa in his house during the entire night. <br/><br/>The Solicitor-General in his brief points out several contradictions in the evidence of these witnesses, but his references are to the testimony taken at the preliminary investigation, which is not a part of the record properly before the court, and the contradictions are not found in the testimony given at the trial. The evidence, however, all comes from witnesses who are relatives or connections of the respective defendants in whose favor they testify; the details of the three independent alibis set up by Santiago, by Acosta, and by Ceferino and Benito Rumbaoa, respectively, are precisely similar, a suspicious circumstance to say the least; and having regard to the facility with which such a defense may be fabricated, we can not attach to the evidence sufficient weight to bring into doubt the positive and in all respects satisfactory evidence of the prosecution connecting the defendants with the crime. We regard their direct participation in the crime as principals as established beyond a reasonable doubt. <br/><br/>These being the facts, of what specific crime should the defendants be convicted? The complaint designates the crime charged as simple murder; but describes it in a manner which shows that the crime of frustrated robbery was committed in connection with that of murder, and it may be that a conviction could be had upon the complaint for the complex crime defined in article 506 of the Code. <br/><br/>We think the deceased was killed under circumstances which imply alevosia. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of May 6, 1876.) The crime of murder was therefore committed either as an independent crime or as one of the constituent elements of the complex crime referred to. If the latter is the true construction of the facts, still we see no objection to a conviction of murder upon this complaint, because as the penalties prescribed for simple murder and for the complex crime of frustrated robbery with murder are identical (article 506 of the Code), no prejudice results to the accused from such conviction. It is therefore of no practical importance in this case whether the crime was simple or complex. If the defendants should hereafter be prosecuted for frustrated robbery, that question might arise, and if it should be held that the crime was complex, such prosecution, involving a liability to punishment additional to that here imposed, could not be maintained. <br/><br/>We have not thought it necessary to discuss the theory advanced in the brief of counsel for the defendants, that the case is governed by article 64 of the Code, fixing the rules for the application of penalties where the crime committed is distinct from that which the accused intended to commit. It is perfectly apparent here that there was a distinct intent to assault the deceased as well as an intent to rob. <br/><br/>Both generic circumstances appreciated by the court below must be discarded. The result is that the penalty was imposed in the proper grade. <br/><br/>The judgment with the modifications indicated is affirmed. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an application for amnesty on behalf of Victorino Correa, Alejo Correa, Martin Langursay, Leandro Monte, and Romualdo Monte. <br/><br/>These men were tried before the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte charged with the murder of Pablo Yungat. The first four were found guilty as principals, and were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Romualdo Monte was found guilty as an accomplice and sentenced to twelve years and one day. The accused appealed to the Supreme Court, and counsel for defense has presented a motion for the application to them of the amnesty proclamation of July 4 last. <br/><br/>The facts in the case as established by the evidence are as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Victorino Correa, who seems to have been the leader of the gang, sent word to the deceased that they were going to barbecue a pig, and invited him to be present at this fiesta. The deceased, accompanied by the person who had given him the message, arrived at the house of Correa, and upon his arrival there he was seized by Leandro Monte and Martin Langursay, and at the same time was struck on the head by a stick wielded by Alejo Correa. Yungat was then tied up elbow to elbow and ankle to ankle. After he was tied he implored Alejo Correa to pardon him, whereupon the latter asked the deceased where he had put the ring which he had taken, to which the deceased replied that he knew nothing of it. Upon this Leandro Monte seized a piece of cane which he trust between the feet of Yungat, assisted by Martin Langursay, and then having fastened the body of Yungat to the same pole they carried him away and buried him. <br/><br/>It appears that the deceased, who was in a dying condition while he was being tied, expired as he was being carried away by the accused. His body was buried in the woods some distance from the scene of the murder. <br/><br/>The evidence for the prosecution rests upon the testimony of three witnesses, two of whom were present at the killing, and one of whom was an eyewitness to the burial. Their testimony is corroborated by that of the person who states that he conveyed the message from Victorino Correa to the deceased, but he did not personally see the killing, he having been hastened out of the way by one of the accused and kept out of sight until after the body of the deceased was disposed of. He testifies to having seen blood around the place, and also testifies to seeing the accused return from the woods alone. <br/><br/>The defense rested entirely on an alibi. The accused all swore that they knew nothing of the killing until some time after the date specified as the time of its commission, and most of them testified that they did not know and had never heard of the deceased. Several witnesses were called in support of the defense and gave the usual alibi testimony. <br/><br/>During the entire trial of the case nothing was brought out to indicate in the slightest degree any motive for this offense other than that indicated by the demand made upon the deceased for the return of the ring above referred to. The motion for amnesty made on behalf of the defense rests upon the theory that these accused were revolutionary soldiers, and that the deceased was killed by reason of political differences existing between him and his slayers. The only thing tending in any way to show that the accused were in the revolutionary army is an anonymous letter which was picked up by the widow of the deceased some time after his death, in which she was told that it was useless for her to continue to look for her husband as he had been killed by  \"Victoriano Correa, Alejo Correa, Martin Langursay, Tilo Correa, Anastasio Muños, Alejandro Monte, and Apolinario Castro, who are insurgents engaged in recruiting companies, and any person who refuses to follow them is killed; therefore, as soon as you receive this letter denounce the killing to the authorities, so that their intention to kill people may be frustrated; if they are tortured they will tell the truth; I do not sign my name because my life will be in peril.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Upon the receipt of this information complaint was filed by the widow and the accused arrested, but in the trial of the case this letter was not introduced, nor was any evidence whatsoever adduced tending to show that the killing was in any way connected with the revolution. <br/><br/>The application for amnesty must be overruled, which is accordingly done. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Mapa, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The petition in this case alleges that the plaintiff is and has been since July 1, 1902, assistant chief of the Fire Department of Manila with a salary of $150 per month, United States currency; that the defendant during that time was and now is the disbursing officer of said city; that the Commission on July 14, 1902, appropriated a sufficient sum of money to pay the salary of the plaintiff during the year commencing with July 1, 1902; that such sum of money had been duly placed in the possession of the defendant as disbursing officer; that the plaintiff had duly performed his duties as such assistant chief during the months of July, August, and September, 1902, as appeared by certificates duly filed with the defendant; that he had tendered to the defendant proper receipts and that the defendant had refused to pay him any part of his salary for said three months. <br/><br/>The prayer of the petition was that a writ of mandamus issue to compel the defendant to pay this salary. <br/><br/>A summons was issued and served. The defendant appeared and demurred on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction of the defendant, nor of the subject matter of the action; that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the plaintiff had another remedy, which was plain, speedy, and adequate. <br/><br/>The case was heard upon this demurrer. <br/><br/>1. It is suggested by the plaintiff that a demurrer is not proper in a proceeding of this character. <br/><br/>Original jurisdiction in mandamus proceedings is given to this court by article 515 of the Code of Civil Procedure. By that same article it is required to follow the procedure prescribed for Courts of First Instance in like cases. The only articles which declare what that procedure, prior to the judgment, shall be are articles 222, 229 and 230. Article 222 is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Mandate. — When the complaint in an action in a Court of First Instance alleges that any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled and from which he is unlawfully precluded by such inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, and the court, on trial, finds the allegations of the complaint to be true, it may, if there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law, render a judgment granting a peremptory order against the defendant, commanding him, immediately after the receipt of such order, or at some other specified time, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the plaintiff.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The part of the article which relates to the procedure may be reduced to this:  \"When the complaint in an action in a Court of First Instance alleges . . . and the court on trial finds the allegations of the complaint to be true, it may . . . render a judgment granting a peremptory order.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>From this language it must be inferred that proceedings in mandamus constitute a civil action in which there is a complaint. <br/><br/>In view of the fact that this is a civil action; that article 222 says nothing more about the procedure than that there is to be a trial and a judgment and thus fails to point out any different procedure, it necessarily follows that the procedure leading up to such trial and judgment must be the procedure marked out by the Code for ordinary civil actions. We have accordingly adopted the practice of requiring a summons to be issued upon the filing of the complaint, in accordance with article 390 and the case to be proceeded with in the ordinary way like any other civil action. <br/><br/>The fact that this practice is radically different from that known in the United States is of no importance. The statutes there to speak of writs of mandamus, of alternative and peremptory writs, of petitions and affidavits, of orders to show cause. None of these words and phrases occur in our Code. The Commission had these statutes before them when the Code was written. If they had intended to adopt that practice it would have been very easy to have said so. <br/><br/>The objections that our construction of this remedial process deprives it of its summary character is without weight in view of article 230, which authorizes the court to expedite the proceedings. Article 229 also secures the right to a preliminary injunction upon the filing of the complaint. <br/><br/>The defendant had a right to demur. <br/><br/>2. In order to determine the sufficiency of the complaint it is necessary to examine the statutory provisions relating to the payment of Government employees. <br/><br/>The money to pay this particular salary for this particular period was appropriated by Act No. 430. <br/><br/>Articles 18 and 19 of Act 183, the Charter of the city of Manila, are as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"ART. 18. Insular Auditor to audit accounts of city. — The Auditor for the Philippine Archipelago shall receive and audit all accounts of the city of Manila, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 90. <br/><br/>\"ART. 19. Insular Treasurer to receive and keep moneys of city. — The Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago shall receive and safely keep all moneys arising from the revenues of the city of Manila, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 90, and shall expend the same upon warrants drawn in accordance with the provisions of said act. Requisitions for such warrants, in favor of the disbursing officer of the Board, shall be made by the head of the department of the city government to which the business relates, subject to the approval of the Civil Governor.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 25 of said charter provides as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Powers and duties of heads of departments. — Each head of department of the city government shall be in control of such department, under the direction and supervision of the Board, and shall possess such powers as may be prescribed herein or by ordinance. He shall make requisition in duplicate for all funds required for the use of his department during the ensuing month. All warrants drawn in accordance with such requisitions shall be in favor of the disbursing officer of the Board, and shall be disbursed pursuant to appropriations.

Requisitions for advances from funds in the hands of the Treasurer for paying necessary and proper expenses chargeable to the revenues of the Islands shall be made monthly by the respective officers or agents authorized to disburse the same, in such form as may be prescribed, pursuant to appropriations made, and shall be accompanied by itemized estimates for the amounts required for disbursement during the month, and no accountable warrant shall be drawn for an amount exceeding the requirements for one month. <br/><br/>\"RULE 26. Each requisition shall particularly state the items of appropriation under which the money is to be disbursed, and shall be forwarded to the Auditor, who shall cause to be indorsed thereon the balance due to or from the officer or agent making the requisition, as shown by the books of the Auditor’s office, and the amount of credits shown by any unsettled accounts of such officer or agent remaining in the Auditor’s office. Thereupon such requisition shall be transmitted to the Military Governor for his approval, and when his approval shall be indorsed thereon the requisition shall be returned to the Auditor for allowance, and when allowed by him and so indorsed upon the requisition, over his official signature, the proper warrant shall be issued for the amount allowed, to which the requisition shall be attached.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>That the approval by the Governor and the allowance by the Auditor of a requisition are necessary before an accountable warrant can be paid is also stated in rules 55 and 68. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the defendant that this approval of the Auditor should have been alleged in the complaint. It is alleged that the money to pay this salary  \"was a provided by law placed under the control of said defendant as such disbursing officer.\" It could not in conformity with the law have been placed under his control unless all the steps marked out by the statute had been taken, including the approval of the Auditor. We do not think that it was necessary to allege in the complaint all these proceedings. It was sufficient to state the ultimate fact, namely, that the money was in the hands of the defendant as provided by law. (State v. Ames, 31 Minn. 440, 444.) <br/><br/>3. It is also claimed by the defendant that rule 72 of said Act No. 90 debars the plaintiff from this relief. That rule provides that  \"any person aggrieved by the action or decision of the Auditor in the settlement of his account or claim\" may appeal. Under the statutory provisions before cited it is difficult to see how the plaintiff could have any account with the Auditor or how that official could settle it. Disbursing officers after paying employees must settle with the Auditor. If aggrieved by his decision they are the ones to appeal. But until the money is paid there is no account to settle. Our attention has not been called to any law which would allow this plaintiff to present his claim directly to the Auditor for his decision thereon. Moreover, the Auditor has not yet made any decision against the plaintiff. That official’s approval of the estimate was favorable to him. <br/><br/>4. It is further claimed by the defendant that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief because he can maintain an action against the city to recover his salary, or one upon the bond of the defendant, and therefore has another plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. <br/><br/>Article 222 does not allow the court to grant a peremptory order if there is such a remedy. Its existence goes to the foundation of the plaintiff’s right to the relief and we can not agree with the defendant’s claim that this objection can not be taken by the demurrer. We think that it falls under No. 5, article 91, of the Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>Assuming that such an action could be maintained by the plaintiff we find no provision in the Charter of Manila relating to the payment of judgments which may be obtained against the city. The city has no control over its revenue. All of it, as fast as it is received, is paid to the Insular Treasurer. Before the city can use any of its money for the purpose of paying judgments against it or for any other purpose the Commission must pass a law specifically appropriating the money. After the money has been appropriated it can not be withdrawn without the consent of the Civil Governor and the Insular Auditor. <br/><br/>Should the plaintiff recover a judgment against the city he would have to procure the enactment by the Commission of a law appropriating money to pay it. He then would have to get the head of the Department of Fires and Building Inspection to make a requisition for this sum, the Civil Governor to approve it, the Insular Auditor to allow it, and the disbursing officer of the city to pay it. He might be met with a refusal at each of these steps, and after they had all been taken he might find himself where he is today by the refusal of the last-named officer to pay him the money. It is not necessary to consider authorities from the United States. It is enough to say that such a remedy is certainly not a speedy one and there is difficulty in calling it a plain one. <br/><br/>The fact that the defendant by article 1 of Act 145 is required to give a bond to the Insular Government for the faithful performance of his duties is not a bar to this action. (Fremont v. Grippin, 10 Cal., 212.) <br/><br/>5. Article 6 of the Charter is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Duties of disbursing officer of Board. — The Board shall appoint a disbursing officer, who shall be charged with the duty of disbursing all moneys drawn from the Insular Treasury pursuant to appropriations made by the Commission. He shall discharge his duties in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 145, prescribing the duties of disbursing clerks, and shall render his accounts in such manner as the Auditor for the Philippine Archipelago may prescribe.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Article 1 of Act No. 145 provides as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Each head of a civil department, bureau, or office is hereby authorized to appoint, in accordance with law, a disbursing clerk, whose duties shall be to disburse, in accordance with law, and upon approval of the head of the department, bureau, or office to which his duties relate, all moneys appropriated for said department, bureau, or office.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The complaint alleges that proper certificates showing that he was entitled to receive his salary had been filed with the defendant. <br/><br/>The only duty which the defendant had to perform in this case was to pay the money to the plaintiff. This was a duty purely ministerial,  \"which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from\" his office. <br/><br/>The Minnesota and California statutes contain the same words as article 222, though they are differently arranged. The decisions in those States allow this remedy in cases like the present. <br/><br/>The petition states a cause of action. <br/><br/>The demurrer is overruled. The defendant may answer within ten days after notice of this decision. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Smith, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant, Bonifacio Modama, was charged with the offense of the theft of $1,000, United States currency, and has been convicted by the Court of First Instance and condemned to the punishment of three years six months and twenty days of presidio correccional and to the restitution to the injured party of the amount stolen, and in the event of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment in satisfaction of the amount, with costs of the proceedings, from which judgment he appeals to this court. <br/><br/>The testimony shows that on the 12th day of November, 1901, Captain White, who was a guest at the Giralda Hotel in the city of Manila, had, in the inside pocket of his hand satchel, $1,000 in $20 gold certificates, United States currency, nearly all new, which satchel he took with him into his room at the hotel and placed under the head of the bed; that about five o’clock in the afternoon he and his family absented themselves from the room for a couple of hours, and that at about ten o’clock that night upon opening his satchel he found that the money had disappeared; that the door of his room was unlocked, it having been left open in order that the muchacho, who was the defendant, should have entrance to the room for the purpose of arranging it; that the defendant failed to put in an appearance at the hotel the next day, and the complainant thereupon reported the loss of the money and the circumstances to the Chief of the Secret Service for investigation. The matter was placed in hands of detectives with the description which had been given of the defendant. The defendant was arrested at a saloon in the city of Manila, and upon his person was found the sum of $280 in $20 gold bills. He was taken to the police station, and being questioned by the Chief of Police as to where he got the money replied that he was a servant of an American captain and that he entered his room to make up the bed with another muchacho called Juan Mendoza, and that they took the money and divided it between them. Upon being interrogated as to his place of residence the Chief of Police and a detective accompanied him to his house. They searched the premises and found various articles belonging to the Giralda Hotel, and noticing the strange deportment of the wife of the defendant, who had her hand upon her breast and seemed much disturbed, the officer seized her by the wrist and drew her hand from her bosom and found in it five bills of $20 in gold and two bills of five dollars, gold, each. Upon being asked where she got the money she stated that she had already used a $20 bill in the purchase of some jewelry. The defendant being asked by the officer if this money was taken from the same place as he had taken the other money replied in the affirmative. He was asked what he had done with the rest of the money, and said that a muchacho called Juan Mendoza had the remainder. This occurred in the presence of the Chief of Police and of the officer. The money was identified by the owner as bills having a similar appearance to those which he had lost. We think this evidence shows clearly the theft of the property by the defendant as alleged in the complaint. <br/><br/>Under article 518, No. 1, of the Penal Code the theft of an amount exceeding 6,250 pesetas is punished by presidio correccional in its minimum and medium degrees. It is contended by counsel for the defendant that the amount of money found on the person of the defendant and that taken from the possession of his wife was less than 6,250 pesetas, and that the defendant should receive the punishment of arresto mayor. All of the money, amounting to $1,000, was taken from the satchel, and if the defendant himself did not appropriate to his own use the entire amount, still it is evident that the amount of $1,000, gold, was taken by him. It is immaterial whether he made the division claimed to have been made of the money or not. The defendant was indicted under article 518 of the Penal Code. He might have been charged with the offense defined in article 520 of the Penal Code, under which he would have been punishable with the penalty next higher in degree, it being shown that he was a domestic of the Giralda Hotel at which the complaining witness lived at the time, but the fact that he was such domestic has not been alleged in the complaint, which should have been done in order to sustain a conviction under article 520. The indictment not having been drawn under this section this circumstance can not be considered as qualifying the offense and raising it to a higher degree. However, under paragraph 10 of article 10 the law defines and enumerates circumstances which aggravate criminal liability and when the act is committed with the abuse of confidence those circumstances may be considered without the necessity of alleging the aggravating circumstances. <br/><br/>Taking into consideration paragraph 10, article 10, as an aggravating circumstance, and giving the defendant the benefit of article 11 as reducing the penalty, the defendant is guilty of the offense punishable with that of presidio correccional in the medium degree, the minimum of which is imprisonment for the period of three years six months and twenty-one days, which we think is the punishment applicable to the case as proven. This is substantially the penalty fixed by the lower court. <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed and the defendant, Bonifacio Modama, is condemned to the punishment of three years six months and twenty-one days of presidio correccional, and to the restitution to the complaining witness, George White, of the sum of $1,000, gold, less the sum of $485, gold, taken from the possession of the defendant, and in case of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for each twelve and one-half pesetas, the amount of subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one year, together with the costs of the proceedings. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Smith, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The appellant filed a criminal complaint against the defendant for the crime of libel (injurias graves), defined and punished by article 458 of the Penal Code, alleging that in issue No. 16, dated September 15, 1901, of the weekly paper called  \"Miau,\" published in this city and of which the defendant was the editor, an article was published under the heading  \"D. Benito Legarda y Tuason,\" and to which reference was made by the complaint, it not being reproduced verbatim on account of its great length; that in said article certain defamatory statements are made, tending to discredit the complainant and to bring him into contempt by charging him with vice and immorality, which defamation tends to prejudice his good name, credit and honesty. <br/><br/>A prosecution having been had upon the said complaint the judge of the court below, on the 6th day of May, 1902, entered judgment, in which he declared the defendant to be guilty and condemned him to suffer six months’ banishment and to pay a fine of 625 pesetas and the costs of the action. <br/><br/>The private prosecutor appealed from this judgment, against which the defendant on his part did not appeal. <br/><br/>The evidence taken during the trial shows fully that the accused was the editor of  \"Miau\" at the time of publication of the article upon which the complaint is based. The text of this article, on the other hand, leaves no room for doubt as to its defamatory character and of the gravity of the defamamtory statements made therein concerning the complainant. It is sufficient to merely read the article to reach this conclusion. The accused himself must have been so fully convinced of this fact that he made no attempt to even deny it or discuss it, and much less to demonstrate the contrary, but simply offered to prove the truth of the charges made against the complainant in this article, which offer to prove was properly rejected by the judge, in accordance with the provisions of article 460 of the Penal Code, to the effect that  \"the defendant in a prosecution for libel (injuria) shall not be allowed to introduce evidence as to the truth of the charges . . .\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Such an offer, properly regarded, to a certain extent is an implied acknowledgment on the part of the accused that he was the author of the article in question. <br/><br/>It also appears from the record that the complainant was a member of the United States Civil Commission in these Islands at the date of the publication of the article referred to. <br/><br/>Accepting, upon these grounds, the opinion of the court below as to the guilt of the accused, it is obvious that the penalty imposed upon the latter in the judgment appealed is not that which corresponds to the crime prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Article 458 of the Penal Code provides that written injurias graves made public shall be punished by banishment from the medium to the maximum degree and a fine of 625 to 6,250 pesetas. Under article 462 injuria is considered to have been made in writing and publicly when it is effected by means of printed papers, and this is precisely what has occurred in this case. <br/><br/>The minimum duration of the penalty of banishment in its medium degree is that of two years four months and one day, as appears from the demonstrative table of article 96. Consequently, although the penalty prescribed by article 458 should be imposed in its minimum degree, it must be at least of that duration, and could never be for six months only, more especially in view of the fact that the Penal Code does not recognize the penalty of banishment for so short a time, the duration of this banishment, under article 28, being from six months and a day to six years. <br/><br/>The appellant contends that the penalty prescribed by article 458 should be imposed upon the accused in its maximum degree, because of the concurrence in the commission of the offense of the aggravating circumstance of the commission of the crime in disregard of the respect due the defendant by reason of the dignity of his office as a Commissioner at the time of the publication of the article which led to this prosecution. <br/><br/>The judge below did not apply this circumstance, upon the ground that as no evidence was admissible on the part of the accused as to the truth of the charges contained in the publication, it was impossible to determine whether these charges were or were not made in disregard of the respect due the complainant by reason of his office. According to the judge it would be such a disrespect if the computation was false, but none of it was true. <br/><br/>We can by no means accept this reasoning. The prohibition established by the Penal Code as to the admission of evidence as to the truth of libelous publications is not and can not be an obstacle to the consideration in the commission of the crime of injuria of the dignity of the complainant. This very circumstance constitutes one of the reasons for regarding the injuria as grave. What is in itself merely a slight injuria may be regarded as grave, in accordance with section 4 of article 457, by reason of the status, dignity, and circumstances of the complainant or of the defendant. This demonstrates conclusively that, notwithstanding the prohibition referred to, dignity can and should be considered for the purpose of giving the proper legal classification to the offense, and consequently in determining the penalty which should be imposed upon the defendant, according as the case may be. <br/><br/>When, for the purpose of classifying a defamation as grave it is necessary to take into consideration as an element constituting its gravity the status and dignity of the complainant, as in the case of paragraph 4 of article 457 referred to, this circumstance must be regarded as a qualification of the offense, in which case it can not be produce the effect of augmenting the penalty, under article 78, because it has already been considered by the law in defining and punishing the crime. This was so held in a decision rendered on the 8th of November last in the case entitled Pardo de Tavera v. Vicente Garcia Valdez. But when the defamation is per se of a grave character, or so classified independently of the dignity of the person defamed, as occurs, among other cases, in that falling under paragraph 2 of article 457, which is precisely the case now before us, than this circumstance is to be regarded as a generic, aggravating circumstance, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of February 5, 1884.) The court below, by failing to so regard it in the judgment appealed, clearly violated this provision. <br/><br/>Therefore an error of law was committed in the said judgment: (1) In so far as the accused is thereby condemned to six months banishment, whereas the duration of this penalty can in no case be less than six months and one day, in accordance with article 28 of the Penal Code; (2) because the penalty prescribed by article 458 of the said Code, this being the article applicable to the crime herein prosecuted, was not inflicted; and (3) because the aggravating circumstance of the commission of the crime in disregard of the respect due the complainant by reason of his office was not applied. This circumstance in this particular case is not qualificative of the defamation, as this is per se of a grave character, having been committed without regard for the dignity of the complainant, and consequently the provisions of paragraph 20 of article 10 were violated. <br/><br/>In addition to this aggravating circumstance it is necessary to consider against the defendant the circumstance of recidivation, indicated in paragraph 18 of article 10. According to this article there is recidivation when the defendant, upon being tried for a crime, has been already convicted of another offense comprised in the same title of the Code, and the defendant has already been convicted of the same offense as that herein prosecuted, to wit, the offense of injuria grave, by the judgment of this court of the 8th of November, 1902, in the prosecution instituted against him at the instance of D. T. Pardo de Tavera, above mentioned. <br/><br/>We therefor condemn the defendant to six years of banishment from the City of Manila and from the territory surrounding it within a radius of 250 kilometers, and to pay a fine of 6,250 pesetas, or, in the event of the failure to pay the same, to suffer subsidiary banishment at the rate of one day for each twelve and one-half pesetas, subject to the provisions of article 50 of the Penal Code, and to pay the costs of this instance. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed, thus modified, is affirmed. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard, Ladd and Smith, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a prosecution for the crime of abduction, defined and punished in article 445 of the Penal Code. In the information five witnesses are cited, among others the woman alleged to have been abducted, to give testimony for the prosecution. <br/><br/>The case having come on trial on the 21st day of April, 1902, the defendant having plead not guilty, it was found necessary to order a continuance, on account of the absence of the witnesses for the prosecution. The case was reset for 9 a.m. on the 25th of the same month. During the trial on that date the abducted woman testified strongly against the defendant. Owing to the lateness of the hour, the case was again continued to 3 o’clock p.m. of the same date. This time having arrived without the appearance of the witnesses for the prosecution who had not yet testified, the court below, without further proceedings, acquitted the defendant, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>The judge has not stated the legal grounds upon which he reached this conclusion, but whatever they may have been it is unquestionable that the facts charged, if true, constitute the crime of abduction. The testimony of the prosecutrix having been given, which can not be disregarded as an element of proof because it is the testimony of the injured party, but should have been weighed by the court within its discretion like that of any other witness in accordance with section 55 of General Orders, No. 58, the case should have been continued throughout as provided by section 31 of the order cited, and the defendant given an opportunity to introduce evidence on his behalf, as it would be improper to determine the case without giving him an opportunity to make his defense. The defendant not having been given this opportunity, he has been left defenseless in this case. The right to a defense being an essential one, it follows that the trial was fatally defective, and that therefore the judgment rendered therein can not stand (sec. 10, General Orders, No. 58). <br/><br/>We therefore reverse the judgment appealed, with directions to the judge to continue the case in accordance with law, with the costs of this issuance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendants were convicted at first instance and condemned to the penalty of death for the crime of the murder of Antonio, Juan, Julian, Nicomedes, Lucio, Severo, and Isabel Echevarria, of Candida de los Reyes, of one Dionisio, and of Antonio Caldevilla. The case has been sent to this court in consultation of the judgment by which this penalty was imposed upon them. <br/><br/>In the night of the 14th or 15th (the exact date does not appear) of the month of August, 1900, the house occupied by the Echevarria family, situated in the hamlet of Naro, then corresponding to the town of Uson and now to the township of Palanas, Province of Masbate, was assaulted by a band composed of some forty men. The malefactors fired two or three shots upon arriving at the house, and then told the people who were living there to come down one at a time. They having done so, the assailants took from them their arms, consisting of guns and revolvers, and tied them elbow to elbow. In this condition the prisoners were killed by being shot or stabbed with bolos. The bodies were subsequently sewn in sacks and thrown in the sea. All the persons named in the complaint were killed in this manner. <br/><br/>These facts are fully established by the testimony of the eyewitnesses Patricia Arma and Diego Atigera. The latter was kidnaped by the malefactors the night before and taken as a prisoner to the place where the crime was committed because, as the malefactors themselves told him, he was a relative of the Echevarrias. <br/><br/>Elvira Clemente, the wife of the deceased Juan Echevarria, corroborates the testimony of the witness avobe mentioned, except as to the manner and form in which the victims were killed. She was not present at this, because she did not leave the house, although she testifies that she knew of the death of the victims because she heard the malefactors themselves state that they had killed them, shortly after the occurrence, and because they were not seen again after that time. She further testify that the malefactors demanded the delivery of the arms which the Echevarrias had, promising not to do them any injury. The witness Patricia Arma apparently intends to convey the same idea by the statement made by her that the Echevarrias did not defend themselves, notwithstanding the fact that they were provided with guns and revolvers, because they did not know what was going to be done to them. <br/><br/>The shots fired by the malefactors were also heard by Tomas Atigera, Policarpia Arisola, and Victoria Garcia, who became so frightened upon hearing the shots that they ran away and hid in the woods. Victoria saw the bodies of all the deceased on the beach, and Policarpia saw the bodies of five of them on the day after the occurrence. <br/><br/>The same witnesses, Patricia Arma and Diego Atigera, testified to having seen Melchor Abelinde at the time the crime was committed, and that he was one of the men who formed part of the band which made the assault. Patricia Arma testified further that she saw him take direct part in the killing of the Echevarrias. <br/><br/>From an examination of the record the conclusion is reached that the malefactors remained at the hamlet of Naro during the night in question; that part of them went away early in the morning of the day following, the others remaining there in the custody of the house while removing the money, rice, and other goods found therein. Melchor Abelinde must have been one of those who remained, and hence it was that he was seen on the morning in question by Tomas Atigera and Camilo Afable, and by Victoria Garciaon the afternoon of the same day, while standing guard at the door of the said house, armed with a saber and a gun. Policarpia Arisola also saw him the same day among the malefactors, although this witness could not testify precisely as to the place where she saw him. <br/><br/>With respect to the other defendant, Leon Arco, nobody saw him on the night in question at the place where the crime was committed. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence points strongly against him. When part of the band which had committed the assault and killed the Echevarrias was leaving the hamlet of Naro, between 8 and 9 o’clock on the morning following, Arco was seen forming part of this band and armed with bolo. So testified Martin Atin and Bernardo Legaspi, who were kidnaped by the band on the road on that occasion. This witness, while in the hands of the malefactors, heard them say that they were coming from the hamlet of Naro, where they had killed the Echevarria family the night before. According to Martin Atin, it was Arco himself, assisted by another member of the gang, who captured him, telling him that if he did not keep quiet they would kill him as they did the people in Naro. This witness also testifies that he noted spots of blood on the sheath of the bolo carried by Arco. It also appears on the testimony of Mariano Santos that when this band was in his house, having come there for the purpose of getting rice, some days after the event in question, the defendant Arco was one of the gang; that the bolo he carried was stained with blood; that one of the party stated in a loud voice that they had killed the Echevarrias at the hamlet of Naro, and that Arco heard this statement and did not deny it. <br/><br/>These proofs in themselves are sufficiently conclusive to produce a full conviction of the guilt of the defendants, and they have still greater force in connection with their own testimony at the trial. They confessed that it was true that they were present at the hamlet of Naro, together with the slayers of the Echevarrias family on the ocasion in question. The force of this confession is not overcome by the fact that they alleged that they have been kidnaped and taken there forcibly by the malefactors, and that the latter left them, the defendants, tied to some trees at some distance from the house of the Echevarrias while they committed the crime herein prosecuted, and only set them at liberty afterwards; because not only have they failed to prove in any degree the truth of this alleged kidnaping, but the merits of the case, which have been briefly analyzed, prove precisely the contrary. <br/><br/>It is a matter of absolute indifference whether the accused did or did not kill the deceased by their own hands. Although they might not have done so — there is proof to the contrary with respect to Melchor Abelinde — it is sufficient that they were present as a part of the band of murderers at the time and place of the occurrence, thus contributing by their presence to augment the power of the band and to aid in the successful realization of their purposes in order to become responsible by direct participation for the death of the victims, in accordance with article 13 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The fact that the deceased were killed while tied elbow to elbow, and therefore prevented from making any defense, constitutes the circumstance of alevosia, defined in paragraph 2 of article 10 of the Penal Code. Hence, the crime prosecuted in this case was properly classified in the court below in its judgment as that of murder, defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that the defendants have done anything which might tend to add ignominy to the effects peculiar to the crime committed, or that they had any intention to affront the age and sex of any of the deceased. Consequently the court below erred in considering against the defendants aggravating circumstances Nos. 12 and 20 of article 10 of the Code. With respect to the circumstance of the commission of the crime in the nighttime and in a gang, which the court below also considered as aggravating circumstances, these circumstances must be regarded as involved in the circumstance of alevosia, inasmuch as in the daytime, and if the malefactors had been less than four, the minimum number necessary, under article 505, to constitute a gang, it would not have been possible for them to have overcome so many victims, to the extent of allowing themselves to be tied without making the slightest resistance, having, as they did, guns and revolvers with which they might defend themselves, and not without certain advantages from a position of defense in the house. It is to be supposed that they would have done so had the gang which made the assault been less numerous, and had they been able to expect the assistance of their neighbors, which might naturally be more readily counted upon in the daytime than in the nighttime. Hence the circumstance of nocturnity and the circumstance of the commission of the crime by a gang were principal and doubtless necessary elements which made possible the existence of the alevosia, which consisted in the killing of the deceased while tied elbow to elbow, as otherwise the result of the attack might perhaps have been different, in view of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the case. <br/><br/>What appears to be unquestionable is that the slayers of the Echevarrias acted upon premeditation. The agreement between them to form the numerous gang which perpetrated the crime prosecuted is an agreement which must necessarily have been preceded by a mutual and a reiterated communication of ideas, intentions, and plans relative to the commission of the said crime; the fact that Diego Atigera was kidnaped twenty four hours before the occurrence, for the sole reason, as stated by the defendant themselves, that he was a relative of the Echevarrias, and that he was not restored to liberty until after the murder of the latter had been accomplished, and doubtless with the purpose — as there is no other which can be imagined — of preventing him from warning the Echevarrias of the danger which threatened them and of which Atigera must doubtless have had some information, all demonstrates that since the preceding day they had taken precautions tending to insure the success of their criminal enterprise, and constitute facts which give evidence of a reflexive and persistent deliberation upon the commission of the crime. This it is which constitutes known premeditation within the meaning of the Penal Code. This aggravating circumstance must therefore be considered against the defendants, by virtue of paragraph 7 of article 10 of the said Code. <br/><br/>Aggravating circumstance No. 8 of the same article must also be considered, because the malefactors made use of the fraud in the commission of the crime, deceiving the deceased with the false promise that no harm would be done them if they would peaceably give up the guns and revolvers in their possession, and then killing them after so obtaining the weapons. There is good reason to believe that, as the victims were so numerous and were so well prepared for the defense, they would not have surrendered at the first intimation without the slightest resistance had they not confided in good faith in the sincerity of that promise. <br/><br/>Counsel for the defense, during the pendency of the appeal, has moved the court to apply in favor of the defendants the amnesty of July 4 last, alleging that the deceased belonged to a Spanish family and were killed by reason of the political feuds and hatreds arising from the fact that the deceased had formerly been caciques of the town in which they lived. <br/><br/>The merits of the defense do not support this allegation. It does not appear, in any manner whatsoever, that the slayers of the Echevarrias had taken part in the insurrection against Spain or against the United States, or that they had committed the crime to advance the interest of the said insurrection, or that it was due to motives more or less connected therewith. The mere fact that the deceased were Spaniards is not sufficient to authorize the conclusion that their death was due to political hatred or dissensions, there being absolutely no evidence upon which to support such a supposition. There is no way in which the conclusion can be legally drawn from the record that the defendants committed the crime of which they are charged with any political purpose or motive. On the contrary, it appears perfectly clear and evident from the testimony of all the witnesses in the case that their principal object was that of robbery, and this purpose was effected, they having stolen everything there was in the house of the Echevarrias. No charge of robbery was, however, included in the information and therefore can not be passed upon in our decision. These facts, however, invest the murder of the Echevarrias with all the characteristics of a common crime, and therefore not embraced by the amnesty proclamation invoked by the defense. <br/><br/>For the reasons above expressed we overrule the motion of the defendants for the application of the amnesty, and affirm the judgment below, with the modifications above indicated with respect to the aggravating circumstances which should be considered against the said defendants, with the costs of this instance against them. So ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant, Bibiano Capisonda, is charged with the crime of homicide punishable under article 404 of the Penal Code, he having killed Lucila Marasigan, a girl 15 years of age, by a shot from a gun. He was adjudged guilty by the lower courts and condemned to the punishment of fourteen years eight months and one day of reclusion temporal with the corresponding accessories and the costs of suit, and in case of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment, and the right to indemnification was reserved to the family of the deceased, from which judgment he has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>It appears from the evidence in the case that on the 12th day of February last, at 8 o’clock at night, the defendant, who was then sergeant of police of the town of Gumaga, was standing in front of the municipal presidencia, which was the police quarters, when the deceased, Lucila Marasigan, being directly across the street in front of the presidencia was fired at by the defendant and was struck in the left shoulder, the wound producing almost instant death. He attempts to justify the act under paragraph 11, article 8, which exempts from criminal liability an officer who acts in the fulfillment of his duty. <br/><br/>The defendant testified in the case, and stated that he fired the shot under the following circumstances:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>That an order had been given by the lieutenant of police that after 8 o’clock at night no person should be permitted on the streets, and that any person found after that hour should be given the order  \"halt\" three times, and should such person refuse to obey the order he should be fired upon. He states that while standing with the sentinel at the place indicated he saw at a distance of about 30 varas a person advancing in his direction; that he gave the word  \"halt\" three times to which the reply  \"insurrecto\" was made, and that not being able to distinguish the person who gave the reply he discharged his gun at the deceased. <br/><br/>Francisco Villapando, Emeterio Capito, and Juan Barreto, policemen of the city, who were present or near by at the time, testified in the case. They were comrades of the defendant, and apparently are not unfriendly toward him. Francisco Villapando testified to the fact of the shooting of the deceased by the defendant; that the deceased was at a distance of about seven steps at the time; that the deceased was in front of the house of her sister at which place the deceased lived, and was about to enter the house when the shooting occurred; that the shooting occurred at 8 o’clock at night, just as the clock was striking that hour; that there was a lamp in the house of the deceased which gave light to the particular place where the deceased was standing; that the light was sufficient for a person to be recognized by; that witness was ignorant as to the motive of the defendant in shooting the deceased. This witness stated that the order from the lieutenant of police was, that all persons found on the streets at 8.30 p.m. should be halted. He corroborates the defendant in the statement that the defendant gave the word  \"halt\" three times, and afterwards fired, but does not know to whom the word  \"halt\" was given because he was within the presidencia; that upon hearing the shot he went out and saw the defendant, and also saw the deceased stretched upon the ground; that he heard the word  \"insurrecto,\" but did not know who uttered this word. He testifies to having seen the deceased, Lucila, passing just before the shot was fired and recognized her clothed as a woman. He knows that the defendant was personally acquainted with the deceased; that deceased was well known in the town. <br/><br/>The witness Emeterio Capito testifies that the deceased was coming from a neighboring house to the place where she lived, opposite to where the defendant was standing; that when the deceased was in front of the defendant the defendant raised his gun and fired; that the deceased was about 6 varas distant from the defendant; that the shooting occurred at 8 o’clock; that there was a lamp whose light shone clearly in the streets at that time; that the deceased could have been recognized by the light; that he does not know the motive of the defendant for killing the deceased; that the defendant said nothing before the shooting, and that he heard the deceased say nothing; that when the shooting occurred the sentinel, whose name is Leon Hernandez, was standing guard with the defendant, and seized the defendant and carried him into the police quarters. He states that the defendant and the deceased were old acquaintances, but he does not know whether there was any enmity between them or not; that he did not hear the defendant give the word  \"halt.\" This witness testifies that the defendant was accustomed to drinking vino, and thinks that he was drunk that night. <br/><br/>The witness Juan Barreto testifies that he knew the deceased for a number of years; that he was not present at the time of the shooting — he was just inside the police station in front of which the defendant was standing, and heard the shot; that Juan Robinson and Emilia Marasigan, sister of the deceased, hastened to the aid of the deceased; that the deceased was dead at the time he reached her; that defendant knew the deceased, and that she was well known in the town; that the deceased fell in front of her house; that there was a light in the house of the deceased, burning low; that he did not think it was sufficient to recognize a person by from the police station nor to distinguish a man from a woman; that a lamp was placed in the window of the store underneath the residence of the deceased to light the store; that the light shone both inside and outside. This witness testifies that the defendant gave the word  \"halt\" three times; that on the night in question the insurrectos were not far from the town; that orders were given the police to halt all passers at 9 o’clock; he also testified that the defendant’s eyesight was bad. <br/><br/>The question in the case is whether the defendant was acting in the bona fide discharge of his duty as sergeant of police at the time of the killing, or whether the killing of the deceased was wrongfully and intentionally done. <br/><br/>The defendant, having admitted the killing, has assumed the task of establishing his defense, not that the burden of proof shifted in the case, but it was necessary for him to establish his defense to the satisfaction of the court. <br/><br/>A very material point in which the testimony of the defendant is contradicted is as to the hour of the night at which all persons were prohibited from appearing upon the streets. The defendant testifies that his orders were to halt all persons found on the streets at 8 o’clock. In this he is contradicted by all the witnesses in the case. Francisco Villapando, who was teniente of the police guard, testifies that the order was to prohibit walking after 8.30 p.m. <br/><br/>Juan Barreto testifies that the hour fixed was 9 p.m. <br/><br/>Emeterio Capito fixes the hour also at 9 p.m. <br/><br/>The deceased met her death precisely at 8 o’clock. The time is definitely fixed by one of the witnesses, who states that the bell of the church clock was just finishing the 8 o’clock stroke. <br/><br/>That the defendant should have halted the deceased an half hour before the time fixed for the halting of persons is sufficient to raise a very serious doubt as to the good faith of the defendant in shooting the deceased. <br/><br/>That the deceased when halted should have uttered the word  \"insurrecto,\" as the defendant testifies, is highly improbable. What motive could she have had in doing so? Besides, the defendant certainly ought to have been able to distinguish the voice of a girl of 15 years of age from that of a man. <br/><br/>One witness testifies that he heard the word  \"insurrecto\" uttered before the shooting; another testifies that the word  \"insurrecto\" was spoken after the shooting. It is quite probable that when the shot was fired some person near by supposed an insurrecto had approached from the fact that the shot was fired, and it was such person who uttered the word  \"insurrecto.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The statement of the accused that the deceased was standing in the dark and that he was not able to distinguish her is not borne out by the testimony. <br/><br/>The witness Villapando testified that there was a lamp in the house of the deceased, which gave light to the particular place where the deceased was standing, and that the light was sufficient to recognize a person by. <br/><br/>The witness Capito testified that the lamp shone clearly in the street, and that the defendant could have recognized the deceased by the light. <br/><br/>We think the testimony in the case is entirely sufficient to disprove the defense. <br/><br/>What the motive for the crime was, so far as appears from the record, must be left in mystery. But it is sufficient that the accused killed the deceased, and not having established his defense he must suffer the consequences which the law imposes for the taking of human life. <br/><br/>We wish to call the attention of the trial judges and the prosecuting attorneys to the fact that evidence taken upon a preliminary examination has no place in the record; that such testimony except in the cases mentioned in the statute is inadmissible upon the trial and can not be considered by this court when placed in the record. <br/><br/>The defendant, Bibiano Capisonda, is adjudged guilty of the crime of homicide as defined in article 404, and we hereby fix his punishment at seventeen years of reclusion temporal, with the corresponding accessories and costs of suit, and further condemn him to the payment of 1,000 pesos indemnification to the heirs of the deceased. <br/><br/>Personal subsidiary liability on account of insolvency can not be imposed upon a person condemned to a penalty higher in the general scale than that of presidio correccional, and the judgment of the lower court was, in this respect, erroenous. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance, with the modification herein made, is affirmed.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant, Francisco Nava, is charged with causing the death of one Luciano de la Cruz through reckless negligence in the following manner:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>On the 14th day of October, 1901, the defendant was the patron of and having full authority over a certain steam launch known as the Mariposa in the harbor of the city of Manila, and having such authority he took in tow a certain lorcha known as the Legaspi. That while the Mariposa was towing the Legaspi by means of a towline the defendant willfully cast loose the towline from the launch Mariposa so as to cause the Legaspi to go adrift, and the Legaspi being without motive power was unable to resist the action of the wind, current, and the sea in the said harbor. That by reason of so being cast adrift the Legaspi was thrown by the action of the wind and waves upon the breakwater, wrecked, and broken to pieces, and that one Luciano de la Cruz, who was then on board of the lorcha Legaspi, was drowned. <br/><br/>The defendant was found guilty under the provisions of article 568 of the Penal Code and sentenced to the penalty of presidio correccional for the period of one year and one day and to the payment of the costs of the proceedings, from which judgment he has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>\"Criminal negligence\" according to Viada,  \"consists in the failure to take such precautions or advance measures in the performance of an act as the most common prudence would suggest, whereby injury is caused to persons or to property.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Does the evidence in the case show such inexcusable negligence and want of care as to amount to reckless negligence?<br/><br/>The evidence shows that about 10 o’clock in the morning of the 14th of October, 1901, the typhoon signal was raised at the Captain of the Port’s Office; that the launches set out to bring into the river the lorchas, cascoes, and other small craft which were used for loading and unloading the vessels in the bay. <br/><br/>That about 3.30 in the afternoon the steam launch Mariposa, of which the defendant was the patron, was solicited by the lorcha Legaspi, which was then lying alongside the steamer Perla, to be towed in the direction of the Pasig river; that the Mariposa took in tow the Legaspi and also three other lorchas; that while the Mariposa is a first-class launch it was unable on account of the weather growing worse to advance with the four lorchas, and she ordered the Legaspi to anchor and await her return. <br/><br/>At about 5.30 in the evening after the fifth typhoon signal was hoisted at the Captain of the Port’s Office, the Mariposa returned to the Legaspi and took her in tow, and was going to take a tow of the lorchas and cascoes that were lying alongside of the ship Esmeralda which was near by, but making a bad mark of it she was delayed for nearly half an hour, when, if properly done, she would have picked them up in five to ten minutes. <br/><br/>The weather in the meanwhile continued to grow worse, the wind increasing in velocity and the waves running high. Under the circumstances the Mariposa desisted in her purpose of taking the other two lorchas and started out for the river with the Legaspi in tow. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the prosecution that it was within the power of the Mariposa to have steamed around the end of the breakwater into the inside of the harbor instead of going up the River Pasig, which was farther than the outer end of the breakwater. <br/><br/>The Esmeralda was at anchor about 50 yards from the breakwater. When about halfway between the Esmeralda and the breakwater the Mariposa with the Legaspi in tow found herself by the action of the wind and water sagging down towards the breakwater. All the steam was put on that the boilers were able to withstand without gaining any distance, and as stated by the defendant, a trepidation being felt as of touching upon rock, the defendant ordered the Legaspi to anchor, and he cast the towline from the Mariposa, sending the Legaspi adrift. The Legaspi, being without motive power, was left to the mercy of the wind and waves and was soon dashed upon the breakwater. All those on the Legaspi succeeded in saving themselves except Luciano de la Cruz. The Mariposa after casting off the Legaspi steamed safely into harbor without giving further attention to the Legaspi or making any effort whatever to save those who had been thus left to their fate. <br/><br/>It can not be said, we think that the acts of the patron of the Mariposa were not strictly adjusted to the necessities of the case. <br/><br/>The weather was continually growing worse, and the Mariposa finding herself unable to make headway against the wind and waves, had the alternative of casting the Legaspi adrift or herself being wrecked on the breakwater. A witness testifies that it was impossible at the time the Mariposa cast the Legaspi adrift to have succeeded in going around the breakwater to the other side. The patron of the Mariposa, perhaps lacking in skill in attempting to reach the lorchas alongside the Esmeralda, lost valuable time, and failing to foresee on leaving the Esmeralda the difficulties which he would encounter in attempting to go up the river, found himself drifting upon the breakwater, and was in such close proximity to the breakwater that the Mariposa could neither go up the river nor turn and make her way around the breakwater and go in the inside, and under these circumstances sent the Legaspi adrift. <br/><br/>The wrecking of the Legaspi seems to have been inevitable before the time of the casting off of its towline. <br/><br/>It can not be said with certainty that the casting off of the towline placed the Legaspi in a worse position than she would have been had the Mariposa held her tow and continued her course toward the river. The circumstances were such that it was impossible to calculate the chances with any degree of certainty. A different course might have been followed, but it is not certain that any other would not have been equally disastrous to the Legaspi. <br/><br/>We not only fail to discover that the defendant was guilty of reckless negligence, but we are in doubt as to whether he could have pursued any other course under the circumstances. <br/><br/>The negligence charged against the defendant is in sending the Legaspi adrift. There is no evidence showing that by proper effort on the part of the defendant the life of de la Cruz could have been saved, and therefore the act of his steaming off in safety can not be considered as an act of negligence. Whether the defendant, to whom was committed the sacred charge of the lives of his fellow beings, acted through the noble impulse and with the courageous conduct which so often characterizes those engaged in his occupation is not a matter for us to determine. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated we must reverse the judgment of the lower court as being unsupported by the evidence and acquit the defendant of the charge, which is accordingly done, and the costs of proceedings are adjudged de oficio.

He admits that the wall was torn down by his direction, but he claims that he acted under the bona fide belief that it was the property of the College of the Sisters of Charity, an institution of which he was at the time the administrator. It is not disputed that he used a part of the stones to repair the pavement of the public highway and the rest in repairs upon the pavement of the courtyard of the college. Apparently he derived no individual pecuniary profit whatever from the stones. <br/><br/>Whether the wall belonged to the college depended upon whether one Jalandoni had conveyed or agreed to convey the land on which it stood to the college. Upon an examination of the record we find it difficult to understand how the defendant could have believed that there had been any such conveyance or any agreement or intention on the part of Jalandoni to make such conveyance, but on the other we find it equally difficult to conceive that a person who, without any attempt at concealment, tears down a stone wall 50 feet long and disposes of the remains, not for his own private gain, but for the benefit of an educational and charitable institution, and for the public in general, can have acted with a genuine criminal intent. Of course, these facts do not exclude the possibility that the intent may have been criminal; there may be other facts not in the record which would give the transaction an altogether different complexion; but with only the light afforded by the meager evidence before us we can not free our minds from grave doubts, and such doubts must be resolved in favor of the defendant. <br/><br/>The judgment of acquittal is affirmed with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Smith, and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

Esteban de la Rama. The suit was commenced on the 4th day of January, 1900, by an executive action, by reason of objections made, a complaint in an ordinary declarative action was filed on the 21st of October 1901. <br/><br/>Paragraph 4 of section 795 plainly states that where the trial has not been already commenced all future procedure in such actions and special proceedings pending in a court at the date of the adoption of the new Code shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Code of 1901, so far as this act may be conveniently applicable to the conduct of such actions or proceedings. <br/><br/>The proceedings in the case, from the filing of the complaint up to the time of the trial, were apparently had in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, but at this stage, after the rendition of judgment, the judge adopted the provisions of the old Code of Civil Procedure and granted an appeal in accordance therewith. <br/><br/>Instead of the case being brought here by bill of exceptions, as it should have been done, an appeal has been taken in which even the provisions of the former law have not been observed, the evidence not having been sent up with the original papers in the case. <br/><br/>We have held in Bustillos v.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">From the record of this case it appears: (1) That the complaint was filed in accordance with the former law of Civil Procedure, and that by it a declarative action of greater import was brought, and that the answer setting up a counterclaim was also filed in accordance with the said law. (2) From this stage on the trial was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the new Code of Civil Procedure, and was set for hearing on the 16th of April, 1902. (3) On the same date, the parties having suggested the appointment of experts for the examination of the accounts, the judge made an order for their appointment. The parties, however, subsequently agreed to substitute one of the experts by another, who was accepted by the court by an order of the 7th of June following. (4) On the 14th of the same month the parties presented a petition in which they proposed another person in substitution of the expert last named, who had resigned, and in this petition they expressed the duties of these two persons in the following terms:  \"The said referees should report solely upon the facts appearing from the record, in accordance with the provisions of article 134 of the Code on Civil Procedure, and the documents presented to the court.\" The court immediately thereafter entered the following order:  \"Upon the filing of the preceding stipulation of the parties, and in accordance therewith, the court will issue a commission in favor of the gentlemen selected as referees in this case.\" (5) The clerk entered the following note:  \"On this date, and in compliance with the preceding order, I have issued, under the seal of this court, the proper commission to the referees in favor of Messrs. William F. Nicholls and Felix Atienza, in accordance with the provisions of article 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" (6) On the same date, the 14th of June, the record shows that the papers were delivered to the referees appointed, and on the 30th of June the papers were returned by the latter, together with a document called an account-current, prepared by the referees, and based, according to their statement, solely upon the documents and accounts-current, appearing in the record. With this they presented their report. (7) The record discloses that the next step taken was to inform the judge of the filing of this statement and report, and that the judge took time to examine the account and report of the referees. Without further proceedings than those above related the court below ordered judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant in the sum of 13,498 pesos and 80 cents, concurring entirely in the report of the referees. <br/><br/>The termination of this trial has been in a high degree irregular. The judge had no authority, either by the consent of the parties or the provisions of the law, to enter judgment as he did. The will of the parties was that the experts called referees were to report solely upon the facts appearing from the record and papers presented to the judge, and in accordance with the provisions of article 134 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Nevertheless, in their report they passed upon three questions of law, upon which they expressed their opinion, the fact being that the parties, in accordance with the provisions of article 134 of the Code, sought nothing more than an agreement as to the facts, and if these referees understood that they were to act as such in accordance with the indication of the acting clerk in his note with respect to article 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in this case they should have complied with the provisions of the said article and those of the following articles, Nos. 138, 139, and 140. None of this, with the exception of the issuance of the commissions and the collections of fees, has been done. The result was a trial by referees, in violation of the provisions of law, this being a substantial defect which vitiates the judgment itself. <br/><br/>We therefore declare the judgment entered below to be null and void, without special condemnation as to costs. It is directed that the record be returned to the court below. So ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard, Ladd and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 14th of August, 1896, a public instrument was executed before a notary public of the city of Iloilo by Guinoo and Deveza, by which the former sold to the latter, in consideration of the sum of 3,540 pesos, a piece of land situated at the places called Lanotan and Simulan of the town of Minuluan, in the District of Occidental Negros, subject to the right of redemption in case the vendor should return the consideration within a period to expire on the 10th of April, 1897. In the event of a failure to return the consideration the sale was to become absolute and irrevocable. In the meantime the vendor was to continue to hold the land and enjoy the usufruct of the same without paying anything to the purchaser. This instrument was provisionally entered in the register, and this provisional entry was subsequently converted into a final inscription. <br/><br/>By petition of the 14th of June, 1898, Solicitor Alejandro Monreal, on behalf of Mariano Deveza, filed a complaint bringing an action of unlawful detainer against Simeon Guinoo, and prayed that after the usual legal proceedings judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and warning the defendant that he would be evicted should he fail to vacate the land mentioned within the term of twenty days, with the costs to said defendant. In support of this petition he alleged that by reason of the expiration of the term agreed upon for the redemption without the return by the vendor to the purchaser of the consideration of the sale the same had become final, and that on this account demand had been made upon Guinoo at the instance of the purchaser by the justice of the peace of Minuluan on the 5th of May previous that he vacate the land and leave the same at the disposal of Deveza, with all its accessories, but that he had failed to do so, and that therefore the said Deveza was entitled to maintain this action of unlawful detainer by reason of the facts of his unquestionable right to the enjoyment of the property held by Guinoo as a precarious tenant without the payment of rent and by him unlawfully detained. <br/><br/>Upon the filing of this complaint a day was set for a hearing, in accordance with the provisions of the old Law of Civil Procedure, but before this time arrived counsel for the defendant, Guinoo, filed a petition, in which he advanced the dilatory plea of lis pendens, and prayed the court to hold that he was not obliged to answer the complaint in this action of unlawful detainer, with the costs to the plaintiff. This petition was served upon the plaintiff, and he was given three days in which to reply. <br/><br/>By another petition counsel for the defendant, Guinoo, moved the court to vacate the order of the 25th of June, 1898, by which a new day was set for the hearing of the verbal action of unlawful detainer, and prayed the court to suspend this hearing until the said exception of lis pendens had been decided. A copy of this petition was also served upon the plaintiff, in order that he might answer the same within three days. <br/><br/>It appears from the minutes of the trial held on the 5th of July of said year, on which date the parties appeared, that the plaintiff urged the same contentions of law and fact as those expressed in his complaint, and prayed for the same relief demanded therein. Counsel for the defendant, however, argued that as a dilatory plea of lis pendens had been interposed he could not answer the complaint in the action for unlawful detainer, believing that the proceedings should be suspended until the plea interposed should have been passed upon, and protested against the celebration of the oral trial, for the suspension of which he had moved the court. The time for trial having passed, the judge adjourned the case until the following day. <br/><br/>The plaintiff, Deveza, filed a written answer to the dilatory plea referred to, and upon the grounds advanced therein prayed that the plea be overruled, with the costs to the defendant. By another petition counsel for the plaintiff asked that the defendant’s motion for the vacation of the order of June 25 be overruled, with costs. <br/><br/>By order of July 5 the court ruled, refusing to take action upon the incidental question raised by the defendant, and denied the motion for the vacation of the order of June 25. <br/><br/>The oral trial having been continued, it appears from the minutes of the proceedings dated July 6, 1898, that the defendant stated that having been notified of the order entered the preceding day he protested against the whole proceedings as null and void, and reserved his right to appeal within the legal term; that without making formal answer to the complaint, he solely desired to state that he did not admit the facts alleged therein; that it was not true that the defendant, Guinoo, was a precarious tenant of the property, or that the plaintiff, Deveza, was or had been the owner thereof, because the deed upon which he based his claim was rescinded by an agreement between the parties, which, in due time, would be proven. With this the hearing was terminated. <br/><br/>Counsel for the defendant filed a petition praying for the reversal of the order of July 5, and that the court direct the suspension of the action of unlawful detainer, with the costs to the plaintiff. Of this petition a copy was served upon the plaintiff by the order of July 27, 1898. Since this date no further proceedings were had in the case. <br/><br/>By petition dated the 16th of January, 1901, Attorney Antonio Jaime entered an appearance on behalf of the plaintiff, Deveza, and prayed the court that after report by the clerk upon the condition of the case a ruling be had upon the plea of lis pendens. The judge, by order of the 21st of September, 1901, and reserving his action with respect to the prayer as to the decision of the plea of lis pendens, admitted Attorney Jaime as a party to the suit in representation of Deveza. <br/><br/>Counsel for the plaintiff, by another petition alleging that the case had already been argued, moved the court to render judgment directing an eviction. The judge, without prejudice to subsequent action upon this motion, directed that notice be served upon the defendant, Guinoo, to appoint an attorney to represent and defend him in the case within a period of fourteen days, notice of which order was served by the usual process. <br/><br/>By order of November 11, 1901, the 13th of that month at 10 a.m. was set for the hearing of the action of unlawful detainer. Directions were given for service of notice of this order upon Vicente Franco, as the representative of the defendant, Guinoo. <br/><br/>On the 15th of November, 1901, the judgment now pending before us on appeal was entered. <br/><br/>As appears from the proceeding resume of an examination of the record, the course of the action for unlawful detainer was suspended while the oral trial prescribed by article 1575 of the Law of Civil Procedure then in force was still pending. <br/><br/>The judge, when setting the case down for trial, appears to have intended (although he did not so expressly state) to apply the provisions of the present Code of Civil Procedure which went into operation on the 1st of October, 1901, and accordingly evidence was received at the hearing, the result of which, however, does not appear from the record, although reference is made to this evidence in the text of the decision. (This decision was entered by the court below, as it appears on page 113 of the record, without complying with the provisions of article 133 of the said Code.) <br/><br/>If the new Code was applied, the judge should have directed the presentation of a bill of exceptions for allowance, in accordance with articles 141 to 143 of the same Code, but under no circumstances could be properly direct that the original papers be sent up. <br/><br/>From an examination of the proceedings had in the case, from page 109 forward, it is evident that the case has not been conducted in accordance with the procedure established by the former Law of Civil Procedure, more especially in articles 1571 and 1575 thereof. <br/><br/>Had the judge authority to apply the new procedural law to this action of unlawful detainer commenced under the old Law of Civil Procedure and still pending at the time the new Code became operative? We think he had not. <br/><br/>Cognizance of actions of unlawful detainer and of all actions arising from an ouster from or the illegal detention of real property, corresponds to the justice of the peace of the place where the property is situated, as expressly provided by article 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Consequently, even had it been possible to apply the new procedural law to this action, in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 795 of the new Code, the special judge of Negros was without jurisdiction to try the case, as jurisdiction over such matters has been vested in the justice of the peace of the place where the property is situated by the provisions of article 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and by those of paragraph 2 of article 56 of the Organic Act. <br/><br/>The provisions of paragraph 3 of article 795 above cited should therefore be applied, and consequently the proceedings in this action of unlawful detainer should be continued in the Court of First Instance of Negros, in accordance with the provisions of the former Law of Civil Procedure. The proceedings had below and recorded on pages 112 et seq. can not be sustained, as they do not conform to the law, and the judgment appealed must also be set aside, because the record does not contain the evidence taken and we are therefore unable to pass upon it as the law requires us to do. Furthermore, in order that a proper judgment may be entered in an action for unlawful detainer, compliance must have been had with all the formal provisions established by the procedural law, the exact observance of which is a matter of public policy. <br/><br/>On the grounds stated we are of the opinion that the proceedings should be set aside from page 112 forward, together with the judgment appealed, which is hereby declared void. The judge is directed to continue the trial of the case in accordance with the old Law of Civil Procedure. No special ruling will be made as to the costs of either instance.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">During the month of January, 1900, chips and stub tickets were used in the Spanish Casino for gambling games, including monte, which was being played there. These chips were made of mother of pearl and were worth from 5 to 100 pesos each; the checks represented $1,000 each. The chips circulated as money in the Casino and also at times on the Escolta. They belonged to the Casino and were to be exchanged for cash therein. In that month there was a person engaged whose duty it was to deliver the chips to the gamblers in exchange for money or I. O. U’s. It does not appear clearly from the record who was in charge of the comptoir during that month, but it is proven that Mr. Lobaton was in charge of the chips and that Ricoy, the accused, was the inspector of the games. The duty of Mr. Ricoy as such inspector was to give orders to Mr. Lobaton with respect to requests for chips made by the players, who purchased them by notes or I. O. U.’s signed by them. Mr. Lobaton delivered no chips to anyone without previous orders from Mr. Ricoy. Mr. Ricoy also signed the stub tickets used in the Casino. <br/><br/>At 2 o’clock on the afternoon of January 3, 1900, a game of monte was commenced in the Spanish Casino, the game on which this case turns, and was ended at 7 o’clock on the morning of the 4th. It was the practice or custom observed in the Casino during that month that the Casino and one of the players were to alternate as bankers. That night Mr. Angeles was banker, and therefore he was entitled to all the profits of the game. <br/><br/>Several players took a hand in the game, including the accused, Ricoy himself, and Messrs. Sabas del Rosario, Mapua, and others. On the night in question, at the request of Ricoy, Sabas, and others who made up the set for the game, Don Joaquin Lafont took part, receiving chips from Señor Lobaton in the comptoir and distributing them to those sitting around the table. Upon receiving chips for the value of $100, $500, or $1,000 the players gave their I. O. U.’s to Señor Lobaton, who kept their account on a half sheet of paper until the liquidation of the deal. Señor Ricoy gave an I. O. U. or not to Mr. Lafont every time he received from the latter $5,000. Señor Mapua did the same. At the end of the game a liquidation was had among all the players. This liquidation was carried out  \"on the basis of the number of due bills or I. O. U.s which Señor Lobaton had received from each player and his note of having made delivery to them.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The result of the liquidation was that Señor Angeles, the banker, had won chips and stub tickets to the value of $39,300. All the witnesses have testified that Señor Angeles delivered to Señor Ricoy all the chips and tickets, and that Señor Ricoy immediately told Señor Lobaton to draw up a note or I. O. U. for the amount; this Señor Lobaton did and Señor Ricoy signed the note and delivered it to Señor Angeles. It does not appear from the record whether Señor Ricoy signed this note as inspector or in his individual capacity. The witness Señor Lobaton repeatedly testified in the case that Señor Ricoy had lost this amount and it appeared from his notes that he had delivered to Ricoy the sum of $39,300. It also appears by the record that Señor Mapua lost the sum of $6,000 in this game, which he paid in his house to Señor Lobaton that same morning, Señor Lobaton turning over the note or I. O. U. to Señor Mapua. It appears from the record of the testimony of the witness Don Jose Olivares that when the note for $39,300 was delivered to Señor Angeles, the latter accepted it, took up the note, and went away. There was no protest on the part of anyone. <br/><br/>The witness Enrique Godino in his testimony used language which indicates that there might be some responsibility on the part of the Casino with respect to the chips and tickets which were in the hands of Señor Angeles before they were delivered to Señor Ricoy. The same appears from the testimony of Señor Olivares. <br/><br/>Señor Lobaton testified that he could not state precisely whether the sum which was represented by the due bill or I. O. U. was won entirely from Ricoy by Angeles, and Señor Lafont testified to the same effect. <br/><br/>Señor Sabas del Rosario affirms that Señor Ricoy made this liquidation by virtue of his office in the Casino. <br/><br/>Señor Lobaton testified that Señor Ricoy had directed him to tell Señor Angeles that he wanted to see him in order to pay him that amount, and that in consequence Señor Lobaton on the 7th told Señor Angeles to call on the following day. On the 8th Messrs. Ricoy, Palma, and others were in the Casino. Señor Ricoy asked Señor Angeles if he had brought the note or due bill, and the latter, having replied affirmatively, took it out of his pocket and handed it to Señor Ricoy. The two immediately went into another room, and there were no eyewitnesses to what occurred between them there. The record only discloses that Señor Angeles returned carrying in his hand a letter which had been delivered to him by Señor Lobaton. This letter is in the record, and reads as follows:  \"Lucio, I have been anxious for a long time to fool an Indian, and I take advantage of this occasion to fool you. Ricoy.\" And Señor Ricoy disappeared. <br/><br/>It does not appear from the record that any attempt was made to recover the note. <br/><br/>The record contains an information charging the accused with the crime of estafa as defined and punished by articles 534 and 535, paragraph 9, of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The act of which the accused is charged and as it appears to have been committed constitutes prima facie a crime. The decision of his inculpability and the judgment of acquittal were premature, the trial not having been terminated either on behalf of the prosecution or defense. The latter had not been able to offer or introduce any testimony, and it appears that on frequent occasions during the taking of the testimony for the prosecution the defense was not allowed to introduce testimony in its behalf, which was postponed to the proper time. <br/><br/>The accused being entitled to a full and complete trial, we are of the opinion that the judgment of acquittal rendered by the Court of First Instance must be set aside and the case remanded, with directions to the court to continue the same from the point in which it was interrupted by the decision, without retaking the testimony received up to that time, which, in so far as it may be relevant and competent, may be considered, and such evidence as may be offered by the accused, and any additional evidence which either of the parties may be entitled to introduce will be taken in the manner prescribed by law. So ordered. <br/><br/>Cooper, Smith and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I dissent. I think that the evidence shows conclusively that the defendant is not guilty of the crime of estafa charged against him and that the judgment of acquittal should consequently be affirmed. <br/><br/>Article 343 of the Penal Code is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The bankers and proprietors of houses where games of chance, stakes, or hazard are played shall be punished with the penalty,\" etc. <br/><br/>\"The players who assemble at the houses referred to shall be punished with,\" etc. <br/><br/>It was plainly proven that monte was played habitually in the Casino during the time in question. It appears from the evidence that the Casino, to encourage the playing of this game, adopted a practice which allowed the members to alternate with the Casino as bankers. It was by the operation of this rule that Angeles was banker on the night in question. The Casino was, therefore, a gaming house within the meaning of the article above cited. The decisions of the Supreme Court are uniform to this effect. (Judgment of November 8, 1897.) <br/><br/>That monte is a game of chance, stakes, or hazard is of course undoubted. <br/><br/>The playing of the game in question was a violation of said article 343. For this crime Angeles was liable as a principal, having been the banker. Ricoy was liable as a principal, having been a player. Whether the Casino owned the building or leased it is immaterial. In either event it was the owner of it for the purposes of said article 343. (Judgment of November 16, 1872.) It was, therefore, liable as a principal in this crime. <br/><br/>From this unlawful game it is claimed that there resulted a binding obligation in favor of Angeles. It is not necessary to determine against whom this alleged obligation existed. <br/><br/>From the evidence I am however inclined to think that it was against the Casino. Before the vale was issued Angeles had in his possessions chips and checks which represented no obligation other than of the Casino. They did not purport to be claims against Mapua, Ricoy, or any other player. The Casino had issued them and had promised to redeem them. The vale may have been signed by Ricoy in his capacity as inspector. There is no evidence that Angeles agreed to accept this vale as the individual obligation of Ricoy in substitution of the claim which he had against the Casino. <br/><br/>Assuming that the obligation, if it exists, is against the Casino it results that the Casino while it and Angeles were engaged in the commission of a crime furnished to him and others tokens to be used in said criminal act, and at the time of furnishing them impliedly promised to redeem them. Can that promise be enforced?<br/><br/>Article 1305 of the Civil Code, speaking of the nullity of contracts, says:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"When the nullity arises from the illegality of the consideration or the object of the contract, if the fact constitutes a crime or misdemeanor common to both contracting parties, they shall have no action against each other, and proceedings shall be instituted against them, and, furthermore, the things or sum which may have been the object of the contract shall be applied as prescribed in the Penal Code with regard to the goods or instruments of the crime or misdemeanor.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This alleged contract sprang from an unlawful enterprise. It had its origin in this criminal act which the parties were then committing. Its cause and object were connected with nothing else. They were both unlawful. (Article 1275 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>The crime was common to all the contracting parties, for Angeles, Ricoy, and the Casino were all principals in it. By the express terms of said article 1305 Angeles has no action against the Casino for the purpose of enforcing this alleged contract. <br/><br/>It may be added that in addition to what is contained in said article 1305, article 345 of the Penal Code says:  \"The money or other articles and the instruments and tools used in gambling or raffles shall be confiscated.\" Had Ricoy and his companions been surprised by the police on the night in question the chips and checks from which this supposed contract proceeded would have been confiscated. <br/><br/>If we suppose that this is the obligation of Ricoy the same result would follow. They were both principals in crime out of which the alleged contract grew. We arrive at this result with reference to Ricoy without considering the provisions of article 1798 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>In what has been said the Casino has been spoken of as a natural person. But the fact that it may be an artificial entity can not alter the result in this case. It is not necessary here to decide against what person connected with the Casino a criminal prosecution should be directed. It is enough to say that when an artificial body is the owner of a gaming house its civil rights and obligations growing out of prohibited games are governed by the provisions of said article 1305. <br/><br/>Was the concealment or destruction of the vale by Ricoy an offense punished by article 535, 9 of the Penal Code?<br/><br/>It represented no obligation. It did not prove or tend to prove the existence or extinction of any right. It was simply a small piece of paper with writing on it. As a mere piece of paper its intrinsic value is too small to be appreciable. Its destruction could not injure Angeles, for it had no value extrinsic or intrinsic. <br/><br/>The words of article 535, 9, are  \"any process, record, document, or any other paper of any character whatsoever.\" While this language is broad it can not be construed as including the destruction of any kind of a paper regardless of what it is in itself or what it represents. A letter of friendship, a card of invitation, a note of regret, which have no value extrinsic or intrinsic, can not be covered by it. <br/><br/>The constant doctrine of the Supreme Court has been that no person could be convicted of estafa unless damage has resulted. It matters not that there may have been deceit or that the defendant thought he was causing damage. If the act which he did was from the nature of the object incapable of causing that damage there can be no conviction. (Judgment of February 4, 1874.) It was claimed by the Solicitor-General in his brief that while an action could not be maintained to recover money won at gaming, by reason of the provisions of article 1798 of the Civil Code, yet, the transaction created a natural obligation, which, by subsequent ratification, might be changed into a legal one. <br/><br/>It is not necessary to decide that question. Article 1798 is applicable to gambling whether that gambling constituted a crime or not. It would, for example, apply to a game of monte played for the first time in a private house, a thing not prohibited by the Penal Code. But this case goes further. Here as we have seen the promise grew out of the commission of a crime. It is similar to a promise to pay money to one man for unlawfully killing another. <br/><br/>Article 565 of the Penal Code is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The burning or destruction of papers or documents, the value of which can be estimated, shall be punished according to the provisions of this chapter; if the value can not be estimated, with the penalties of arresto mayor in its maximum degree to prision correccional in its medium degree and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"The provisions of this article are to be considered as applicable if the deed should not constitute another graver crime.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Ricoy might be convicted under this article, but it seems clear that he can not be convicted of estafa. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 28th of April, 1900, Attorney Arsenio Cruz Herrera, on behalf of Pablo D. Palma, filed a complaint to which was attached a note dated on the 21st of July, 1899, signed by Francisco Ong, as attorney in fact of Juan Cañizares, indorsed by the payee, Saturnina Salazar, to Palma. He also attached, as an exhibit, a notarial act. The complaint was filed for the purpose of instituting an ordinary action against Cañizares to recover judgment against him for the sum of 4,500 pesos, the amount indicated on the indorsement of the note as still due and unpaid, together with interest at the legal rate and the costs of the action. The plaintiff had formerly made an unsuccessful attempt to bring an executive action. The facts alleged in the complaint were that as Cañizares has failed to pay the second and third installments of $500 each on account of his indebtedness of 5,000 pesos, evidenced by the said note, and by reason of the fact that the payee, Salazar, needed the money, she had indorsed the said note to the plaintiff, Palma, with the consent of Cañizares; that Palma had paid the woman, Salazar, $4,500 in currency, as shown by the indorsement of October 20, 1899; that the debtor, Cañizares, up to the date of the complaint, had not paid the debt so indorsed in the manner agreed upon between himself and the original creditor, notwithstanding demand to that end made upon him by the creditor, Palma; that, as appears from the preliminary proceedings had for the purpose of instituting an executive action, the debtor did not allege that the document in question was false, nor did he expressly deny the validity of the claim; that the Chinaman, Francisco Ong, a brother-in-law of the debtor, and who lived with the latter, signed the said note by order of the debtor, and that he admitted before a notary public on the 17th of April the authenticity of his signature and rubric appearing at the foot of the said document, all of which appears from the said notarial act. <br/><br/>The plaintiff also argued as the law applicable to the case that the debtor, Juan Cañizares, had impliedly acknowledged and confessed the legitimacy and certainty of the note and of the indebtedness mentioned, because he did not assert that the document was a forgery, nor did he deny the existence of the credit; that it was not probable, in view of the importance of the amount and the recent date of the note, that he should be unable to remember, as he had stated, whether he did or did not owe this sum to Saturnina Salazar de Abreu, or whether his brother-in-law, Francisco Ong, had or had not executed this instrument by his orders; that obligations arising from contracts have the force of law and should be performed as provided by article 1091 of the Civil Code, and that consequently Cañizares is under obligation to pay the said sum of $5,000 at the rate of $500 from the 21st of July, 1899, in accordance with the agreement; that as he only paid the first installment it is evident that he can be required to pay, not only the installments overdue, but also the whole remaining sum of $4,500, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 1129 of the Civil Code, in addition to interest at the legal rate of 6 per cent as damages, he having been in default since the 7th of November, 1899, upon which date demand was first made upon him in court at the instance of Pama (arts. 1100 and 1108 of the Civil Code); that subrogation, according to article 1212 of the same Code, transfers to the subrogated creditor the claim, with all the rights thereto annexed, against the debtor, and that therefore Palma, who was subrogated to the said credit by the indorsement in his favor by Salazar, can maintain his action to recover from Cañizares the whole sum of $4,500, with interest at 6 per cent per annum, in accordance with the undertaking of the debtor. <br/><br/>The notarial act referred to contains a transcript of the note on page 87, for $5,000, in favor of Saturnina Salazar, with the promise to pay $500 per month. The note bears date the 21st of July, 1899, and is signed by Francisco Ong as attorney in fact of Juan Cañizares. On the back of the note is an indorsement directing payment to the order of Pablo D. Palma of the sum of $4,500 still unpaid by the debtor, Cañizares, which sum Saturnina Salazar, who signs the indorsement, declares she received in cash from Palma in Manila on the 20th of October of the same year. On the margin of the back of the paper there is a note of the payment of the sum of $500 on the 20th of August. <br/><br/>At the instance of Palma, a notary public made demand upon Francisco Ong to state whether he recognized as his the signature and rubric appearing at the foot of the note, to which the said Ong replied that he recognized the said signature and rubric as authentic, adding that he executed this document by the order of the woman, Salazar, who had won from his brother-in-law, Cañizares, in a monte game played in a house on Calle del Rosario, Binondo, the sum of money expressed in the said note. <br/><br/>Attorney Alfredo Chicote, on behalf of the defendant, Juan Cañizares, filed an answer to Palma’s complaint, setting up the following facts: That in a monte game in which Cañizares, Salazar, and several other persons took part on the afternoon of the 22d of June, 1899, in the house belonging to the Chinaman, Lim-Cong-Quian, Cañizares lost the sum of $5,000, which was won by Salazar; that this sum not having been paid the creditor made persistent demands for a settlement, and finally succeeded in obtaining the document in question, which, by order of Cañizares, was drawn and subscribed by the Chinaman, Francisco Ong, the document referred to being the same attached to the complaint; that it was false that the said document was the result of any mercantile operation or transaction between Cañizares and Salazar, or that any mercantile transaction had ever transpired between them, or between the plaintiff and the defendant; that it was false that Cañizares had received from Salazar as a loan the money mentioned in the note, or that he had made any agreement whatsoever with respect to the said note, which had no other value than that it records a sum of money won in a monte game; that he denies all the allegations of fact contained in the complaint in so far as the same are in contradiction of or do not agree with those stated in the answer. <br/><br/>As the law applicable to the case, the defendant contended that a debt can not be regarded as confessed unless it appears clearly and expressly that the debtor admits it, and that in such a case the debt can not be regarded as confessed by the mere fact that the debtor has refrained from alleging the falsity of the document by which the indebtedness is evidenced, because such a confession must be express and not implied; that even if it can be held that a debtor has acknowledged his indebtedness by reason of his refusal to answer interrogatories or by reason of an evasive answer, this declaration must be made by a court and must be based upon the refusal to testify, and after formal judicial demand (arts. 569 of the Law of Civil Procedure and 1226 of the Civil Code); that there is no contract unless the essential requisites for its validity are present, among which is a lawful consideration, not opposed to the law or to good morals (arts. 1261 and 1275 of the Civil Code); that as the consideration in this case arises from a gambling game — an illicit consideration — it follows that the obligation expressed in the document referred to could produce no legal effect and is absolutely unenforceable, there being no valid contract (art. 1278 of the Civil Code); that the law does not allow any action for the recovery of money won in a game of chance, and that losses in a prohibited game, such as monte, do not produce any civil obligation (arts 1798 and 1801); that the subrogation is not legal and does not transfer the credit with the rights thereto annexed when the debtor has not expressly or by implication assented to the payment made by a third person not interested in the obligation (arts. 1209, 1210, and 1212 of the Civil Code); that the burden of proof of obligations rests upon him who demands their performance and that the marginal note is only of effect in so far as it may be favorable to the debtor; that all legal value and effect is denied this subrogation by the defendant, and that the same is impugned as civilly false, and concludes with the petition that the action be dismissed. <br/><br/>In the notarial act attached to the answer of the defendant it appears that at the instance of the Chinaman, Francisco Ong, the notary public, Calixto Reyes, recorded in that act the statements of Emiliano Boncan, the Chinaman, Yap Pueco, the Chinaman, So-Tiaoqui, the Chinaman, Alejandro R. S. Liocsin, the Chinaman, Lu-Hwun, and the Chinaman, Lim-Cangui, who, having been informed of the four questions addressed to them, replied that on the evening of the 22d of June, 1899, they were engaged in a monte game with Juan Cañizares and Saturnina Salazar, in the house of Lim-Cong-Quian, upon which occasion the woman, Salazar, won from Cañizares the sum of $5,000, which, at the termination of the game, was not paid; that to avoid trouble Cañizares consented to the demand of his creditor that he execute a note, and that he did so, giving a note for $5,000, with the obligation of paying this sum at the rate of $500 per month; that this note was dated July 21 and was signed by Francisco Ong, and that this the last three witnesses knew, because they were in Ong’s house, the first three stating that they did not remember the day of the month, but had been informed thereof by the woman, Salazar, and that the statement was subsequently confirmed by Cañizares and by Francisco Ong. <br/><br/>Counsel for the plaintiff, Palma, in his replication, repeated the demand made by his complaint, alleging that the story of the monte game was wholly false and was a pure invention of the defendant, who, further, when demand was made upon him to recognize the document, did not allege that the debt arose from a gambling game, and, reasserting the facts set up in the complaint, alleged further that the credit in question having been indorsed by Salazar to the plaintiff, Palma, with the consent of Cañizares, the latter on various occasions requested the creditor to extend the time of payment, and that the plaintiff had attempted an act of conciliation with the defendant, as shown by the attached certificate. <br/><br/>He also reasserted the propositions of law relied upon in the complaint, and added that the subrogation of Palma to the rights of Salazar was in accordance with the provisions of articles 1210 and 1212, in connection with article 1528 of the Civil Code, and that when the act of conciliation was attempted with Cañizares the latter failed to appear, the plaintiff therefore believing that an attempt to get an amicable settlement was useless. <br/><br/>Counsel for the defendant, Cañizares, in his rejoinder added to the facts stated in the answer that he had absolutely and expressly denied that Cañizares had consented to or approved, expressly or impliedly, the payment alleged to have been made by the plaintiff to the woman, Salazar; furthermore, that he denied that such a payment had been effected, and that be considered at all binding the subrogation whereon plaintiff based his claim, and denied that Cañizares had at any time asked Palma for an extension of time, or that he had dealings with Palma with respect to the sum in suit, denying the facts alleged in the complaint and rejoinder, and reasserted the propositions of law relied on in the answer. <br/><br/>An examination of the evidence produced by both parties in the course of the trial discloses, by the testimony of several unimpeachable witnesses, that on the afternoon of the 22d of June, 1899, a gambling game was played in the house of the Chinaman, Lim-Cong-Quian, in which, among others, Saturnina Salazar and the Chinaman, Juan Cañizares, took part; that the latter, having lost in the game, became indebted to the woman, Salazar, in the sum of $5,000, which, as a result of repeated demands of the creditor, the debtor recorded in a note dated the 21st of July, 1899, signed by Francisco Ong, a brother-in-law of Cañizares, as the attorney in fact of the latter. <br/><br/>Cañizares paid his creditor, on the 20th of August of the same year, on account of the debt, the sum of $500. On the 20th of October following Saturnina Salazar, who affirms that she received from Pablo Palma the sum of $4,500 still owing by Cañizares, indorsed the instrument to Palma, who, by virtue of the indorsement, and availing himself of his rights as subrogated creditor, demanded payment of the said sum. <br/><br/>It is indubitable that the indebtedness of 5,000 pesos expressed in the note referred to arose in a monte game, a game of chance, and therefore expressly prohibited by law. As the law does not allow an action for the recovery of money won in such games (art. 1798 of the Civil Code), it follows that the action brought by Palma can not be maintained, nor can any judgment be rendered by the courts directing the payment of the sum claimed in the complaint. <br/><br/>The undertaking expressed in the note executed by a third person in favor of the woman, Salazar, by order of Cañizares does not constitute a ratification or confirmation of the obligation contracted to pay the sum lost in a monte game. <br/><br/>Saturnina Salazar conveyed or assigned the credit of $4,500 to Pablo Palma, as appears from the indorsement on the note, but has not been satisfactorily proven that the debtor, Juan Cañizares, gave his consent or approval to the subrogation. The testimony of the witnesses presented by the plaintiff is not sufficient to overcome the absolute denial of Cañizares. These witnesses were unable to testify that they were present when the indorsement was written and the note assigned, or that they saw the delivery of the $4,500 by the assignee to the assignor. Their testimony does not show that the defendant consented to or approved of this assignment. <br/><br/>It follows, therefore, that the plaintiff, Palma, in this suit has brought the same action which might have been brought by the woman, Salazar, and as that action can not be maintained, for the reason that the obligation of the supposed debtor, because of its vicious origin, is not enforceable in court, it follows that no recovery can be had in this suit. <br/><br/>For these reasons we are of the opinion that the defendant, Juan Cañizares, is under no obligation to pay to Pablo Palma the sum of $4,500 represented by the note, and the action is therefore dismissed, without special condemnation as to costs. So ordered. <br/><br/>Cooper, Smith, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> and Mapa, <em>J.</em>, dissent. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff alleges that the municipality of Carmona conveyed to him on December 4, 1897, a certain piece of land, the property of the township, in payment or remuneration of certain services rendered by him in the years 1895 and 1896; that since that time he had quiet and peaceable possession of said lands as owner thereof until the 28th day of April, 1900, on which date the defendant, as local president at that time of the said town, without authority to do so, ousted him from his possession, and notified the tenants of the land that from that date henceforth they were to recognize him, the said defendant, as owner of the lands, in his capacity as president of the town. Upon these facts, and availing himself of the action of restitutory interdict, the plaintiff prayed the court that he be restored to the possession of the land from which he had been ousted and that the defendant be condemned to the payment of damages and to the costs of the action. The complaint was filed on the 17th of April, 1901, and contained a description of the land in question as to this area, location, and boundaries. <br/><br/>The action having been prosecuted through its various stages, the Court of First Instance entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, granting him the relief prayed for by restitutory interdict, together with other relief proper in the premises, against which judgment the defendant appealed to this court. <br/><br/>Four witnesses testified for the plaintiff in the preliminary investigation, and three witnesses testified at the trial, all seven having unanimously affirmed that the facts related in the complaint are true, both with respect to the quiet and peaceable possession of the plaintiff and with respect to the ouster by the defendant. Two of them expressly stated that the latter had been in possession of the land since the date on which he made demand upon the tenants as municipal president of Carmona to attorn to him as the owner of the land, and to deal with him in all matters concerning expenses and seed for the cultivation thereof. The fact that three of these witnesses were unable to recall the exact date of the ouster — affirming, however, that it took place some time in the month of April, 1900 — does not diminish the probatory force of their testimony for the purpose of proving the facts upon which the complaint is based, because, considering this testimony in relation with that of the other witnesses, who affirmed that the ouster was effected on the 28th of the said month of April, we can not fail to conclude that this date has sufficiently been proven, by reason of the fact that all the witnesses refer to the same act, the testimony of each serving to corroborate that of the others. <br/><br/>The conveyance of the land in question by the municipality of Carmona to the defendant has also been proved by a certified document (p. 54 of the record), which also contributes to give greater strength, although indirectly, to the grounds of the complaint, inasmuch as it demonstrates the origin of the possession alleged by the plaintiff to have been enjoyed by him. <br/><br/>The defendant does not deny the facts alleged in the complaint, but, on the contrary, admits their truth by his statement (p. 27) that the act which occasioned the ouster (these are his own words) took place on the 1st of April, 1900. It was for the same reason, doubtless, that he offered no evidence whatsoever to offset that of the plaintiff with respect to the fact of the former’s possession of the land and the ouster by the defendant. <br/><br/>The only thing to which the defendant did not agree with respect to this point is the date on which the ouster took place. This he asserts occurred on the 1st day of April, 1900, and not on the 28th, as asserted by the plaintiff. <br/><br/>If the true date were the first mentioned, the result would be that when the complaint was filed, on the 17th of April, 1901, more than one year had expired since the date of the ouster, in which case the action for the recovery of the possession by means of restitutory interdict would have been barred by the statute of limitations, and consequently the complaint would have been dismissed, in accordance with the provisions of article 1635 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such, in effect, is the defense upon which the defendant principally relies to destroy the action instituted by the complaint. <br/><br/>For the purpose of proving that the ouster took place on the 1st of April, 1900, the defendant filed a certified copy (p. 50) of a resolution passed on that date by the municipal council of Carmona, establishing a new system for the cultivation of the town commons, which, under a long-established custom, to use the words of the resolution, was ceded in usufruct to the members of the municipal council of the town for the period of their incumbency of that office. It was doubtless intended to show by this that the plaintiff was deprived of his possession by virtue of this resolution, and on the same date of its passage, which, however, has certainly not been proven in any way in the course of the trial. <br/><br/>Furthermore, it is self-evident that the resolution, per se, could not have produced the effect de facto of depriving the plaintiff of his possession. To that end it was necessary that the resolution be executed by some subsequent act, which act, according to the unanimous testimony of the four witnesses, was effected on the 28th of April, 1900. From this date to the 17th of the same month in the year 1901, on which date the complaint was filed, the year had not expired as contended by the defendant. <br/><br/>The defendant in the second place alleges that the conveyance of the land by the municipality of Carmona to the plaintiff was void, and therefore could produce no legal effect, as several decrees of the General Government of the Philippines, which appear in the record, expressly prohibit the alienation of the common lands of the said municipality for any cause whatsoever. <br/><br/>This allegation is wholly irrelevant, inasmuch as the question in issue here is not the legality of the title by which the plaintiff possesses the land in question, but concerns solely and exclusively the fact of his possession. Whether the conveyance by the municipality of Carmona was valid or not, the fact remains that in consequence thereof the plaintiff was given possession of the said lands, and continued to possess them quietly and peaceably and as owner thereof for a period of over two years, until he was ousted by the defendant upon his own authority in April, 1900. The plaintiff was entitled to have this possession respected until such time as he might have been defeated in the proper action, even if it be true that the deed by which the land was conveyed to him was void. Even if he had been absolutely without title, with nothing more than the naked possession de facto of the land, under article 446 of the Civil Code he was entitled to have this possession respected. <br/><br/>In accordance with this principle the Code of Civil Procedure affords a remedy by restitutory interdict not only to a possessor under a more or less valid title, but even to those who have only the naked possession, if they are despoiled thereof. For the purpose of directing a restitution in such a case it is unnecessary to consider anything further than the fact of the possession and the ouster. Hence no evidence should be admitted in the trial other than that referring to these two points, and any evidence not concerning these issues should be rejected by the court on its own motion. (Arts. 1633, 1634, and 1638.) <br/><br/>We therefore affirm the judgment appealed, with the costs to the <em>Appellant</em>. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper and Smith, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. <br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, with whom concurs LADD, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>We dissent from this opinion. </div>'\n",

Among other laws and orders he cited the order of August 14, 1898, and Acts Nos. 76 and 186 of the United States Civil Commission. He argued that the President of the United States had unquestionable authority to authorize the commanding general and the Civil Commission to establish a judicial system with authority to take cognizance of maritime and admiralty causes, citing a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in support of this doctrine, which was applicable to this Archipelago, which is now analogous to the status of some of the States of the Union during the Mexican was and the war of secession. <br/><br/>The judge, however, by an order of the 14th of September, 1901, held that the court was without jurisdiction to try the accused for the theft alleged to have been committed on the high seas, sustained the demurrer, and ordered the discharge of the defendants, with the costs to the Government. Against this order the prosecuting attorney appealed, and the case was brought before this court. <br/><br/>This case deals with a theft committed on board a transport while navigating the high seas. Act No. 136 of the organic law, as well as Act No. 186 passed by the Civil Commission, and which repealed the former law, Act No. 76, do not expressly confer jurisdiction or authority upon this court to take cognizance of all crimes committed on board vessels on the high seas. While the provisions of the law are clear and precise with respect to civil admiralty or maritime cases, this is not true with respect to criminal cases. If any doubt could arise concerning the true meaning of the law applicable to the case, Act. No. 400 effectively dissipates such doubts. <br/><br/>This law, which is an addition to Act No. 136, by which the courts of justice of the Philippine Islands were organized, in article 1 adds to article 56, consisting of seven paragraphs, another paragraph numbered 8, which reads as follows:  \"Of all crimes and offenses committed on the high seas or beyond the jurisdiction of any country, or within any of the navigable waters of the Philippine Archipelago, on bard a ship or water craft of any kind registered or licensed in the Philippine Islands in accordance with the laws thereof.\" The purpose of this law was to define the jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance in criminal cases for crimes committed on board vessels registered or licensed in the Philippine Islands. The transport Lawton not being a vessel of this class, our courts are without jurisdiction to take cognizance of a crime committed on board the same. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds we consider that the order appealed should be affirmed, with the costs de oficio.

This sum, advanced by Romualda Faz de Leon to her grandson, Lavin, formed part of the sum of 889 pesos, the property of Felicitas Ortiz, the defendant, the daughter of the said Romualda Faz de Leon, which sum of money was in the hands of a Chinese merchant. The jewelry pledged by the grandson to his grandmother was in turn pledged by the daughter, together with some other jewelry belonging to her, to Apolinaria Sy-Quia, as security for a loan of 1,000 pesos. Lavin offered to pay Apolinaria Sy-Quia the 400 pesos which he owed his grandmother, together with the interest accruing thereon up to that time, with the view to obtaining the return of the jewelry pledged. Apolinaria Sy-Quia, however, stated that Felicitas Ortiz had told her that the amount to be paid was 600 pesos as principal and 100 pesos as interest, the additional 200 pesos being part of the 889 pesos referred to, received by Romualda Faz de Leon from a Chinese merchant and loaned by her to Juana Encarnacion, and by the latter in turn loaned to Vicente Lavin, as appears from the receipt signed by the latter and endorsed by Juana Encarnacion to the accused, Felicitas Ortiz. It appears that the jewels were afterwards lost upon the death of Apolinaria Sy-Quia, according to the statement made by the mother of the latter, and it also appears that Felicitas Ortiz obtained from the mother of Apolinaria Sy-Quia the payment of the sum of 2,500 pesos for her jewelry and 1,000 pesos for the jewels of Lavin. The record contains a document, executed apparently by Romualda Faz de Leon in favor of Felicitas Ortiz, in which the former acknowledges to have received from the latter 1,500 pesos in satisfaction of the value of the jewelry belonging to Vicente Lavin and lost while in the possession of Apolinaria Sy-Quia. <br/><br/>Vicente Lavin, upon this, instituted a prosecution against Felicitas Ortiz on the charge of estafa. <br/><br/>In this criminal proceeding we can not consider the causes of actions which may have accrued from the second operation of pledge; from the refusal of Apolinaria Sy-Quia to return the jewelry pledged, upon the tender of payment made by Vicente Lavin of the sum loaned by Romualda Faz de Leon, together with the accrued interest; from the addition to the loan secured by the pledge of 200 pesos more as principal on the account of Felicitas Ortiz, who demanded that this sum be paid by Vicente Lavin, Juana Encarnacion not having done so; from the loss of the jewels while in the possession of the Sy-Quia family; from the payment of the money in lieu of the jewels said to have been made by the mother of Apolinaria Sy-quia to Felicitas Ortiz and by the latter to her grandmother, Romualda Faz de Leon. All these questions are entirely foreign to the issues in this case. We can only consider here the acts which are alleged to constitute the crime of estafa, in the manner and form in which they are alleged to have been committed by the accused. <br/><br/>It does not appear in any manner that the accused has attempted to appropriate or convert the jewels which Vicente Lavin had pledged to his grandmother. The fact of her having pledged them to Apolinaria Sy-Quia was not such an act of appropriation or conversion, nor was it in itself a crime punished by any article of the Penal Code, as the acts appear to have been committed from the allegations in the record. Neither, in consequence, does it appear that the accused, by means of the second pledge, or by the claim for damages by reason of the loss of the jewels, has obtained any profit or gain, nor, furthermore, would such an intent to obtain a profit or gain by any of the means employed constitute a crime under any of the provisions of the Penal Code. She may, perhaps, have acted in excess of her right, or there may have been negligence or even intentional wrong in the acts committed by her, but nothing of this kind has been proven, nor, if it had been proven, has it been shown that the breach of duty which might have resulted has gone beyond the sphere of tortuous negligence, upon which might be predicated a liability for the payment of damages, but which does not constitute the crime punished by paragraph 2 of article 534 of the Code, as defined in section 5 of article 535 thereof, or for which Felicitas Ortiz can be held personally responsible upon a prosecution instituted by Vicente Lavin in his own right, and not on behalf of any other person who may have sustained with the accused any of the legal relations referred to in paragraph 5 of article 535 above cited. The court, therefore, without deciding anything concerning the civil actions which may respectively pertain to the plaintiff and to the accused as arising from the possible sources of obligation before indicated, acquits the defendant, Felicitas Ortiz, with the costs de oficio. So ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Smith, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal by Messrs. Luchsinger &amp; Co. against a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Iloilo. No motion was made for a new trial in the court below, nor was any exception taken other than that against the judgment. This court, therefore can only consider in this instance whether the pleadings and facts admitted and those found by the Court of First Instance are sufficient to support the judgment by him rendered. <br/><br/>From the admissions in the pleadings and from the judgment sought to be reversed the following appear to be the facts in the case:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>In March 1893, Messrs. Luchsinger &amp; Co. brought an executive action against Jose Regalado y Santa Ana for the recovery of 3,929 pesos and 60 cents, alleged to have been owed by the latter upon a promissory note, and, among other property of his, attached a certain warehouse and lot which it is admitted the maker of the note at that time possessed. <br/><br/>In 1896 the Court of First Instance entered a judgment in favor of Luchsinger &amp; Co. and against Jose Regalado y Santa Ana for the total amount of the note, interest, and costs, which judgment was finally affirmed by the Royal Audiencia of Manila in 1897. <br/><br/>The record and the judgment so affirmed were returned to the Court of First Instance of Iloilo for execution, but, owing to the complications arising from claims made by third persons to some of the personality embargoed, the destruction of part of the official records, and the general disturbance occasioned by the Spanish-American and Filipino wars, nothing further was done in the case until the 13th of April, 1900, upon which date the warehouse and lot which this action concerns and which were under attachment, were put up at public auction by an order of the court of the 30th of that month. <br/><br/>On the day of the sale Pedro Regalado, a son of Jose Regalado y Santa Ana, instituted this suit in intervention under claim of ownership, and sought to obtain the suspension of the sale and the dissolution of the attachment, upon the ground that the judgment debtor was not, and that he, the said Pedro Regalado, was the absolute owner of the property to be sold. <br/><br/>Luchsinger &amp; Co. opposed the contention of Pedro Regalado as to the ownership of the property attached, alleging that the acquisition of the property by the latter occurred subsequently to the attachment levied by them, and was therefore unavailing. In consequence of the filing of this complaint in intervention the sale of the warehouse and lot was suspended, and has so continued up to the present time. <br/><br/>On the 21st of March, 1902, more than one year before Luchsinger &amp; Co. sought to obtain payment of their note, Jose Regalado y Santa Ana executed to Samuel Bischoff a mortgage on the warehouse and lot in question, as security for the payment to the latter of the sum of $7,024.74. This mortgage was recorded in Iloilo on the 10th of June, 1892, and was assigned to Jose Maria Regalado by the mortgage on July 12, 1897, but the instrument of assignment was never recorded in the register. <br/><br/>Jose Maria Regalado, as owner of the Bischoff mortgage, received the sum of $9,834.48 in payment thereof, and canceled the mortgage in favor of the mortgagor, Jose Regalado y Santa Ana on the 28th of March, 1900; but the cancellation was not recorded in the register. <br/><br/>On the 2d of March, 1893, Jose Regalado y Santa Ana executed a second mortgage upon the same warehouse and lot in favor of Alejandro Montelibano, to secure to him the payment of the sum of $7,984.87, which mortgage appears to have been recorded on the 18th of March, 1893. <br/><br/>The Montelibano mortgage was assigned by the mortgagee to Jose Maria Regalado on the 8th of August, 1895, and the instrument of assignment was duly recorded on June 19, 1896. <br/><br/>Jose Maria Regalado, as owner of the Montelibano mortgage, received the sum due thereon, amounting to $7,984.87, and canceled the same in favor of Jose Regalado y Santa Ana on March 9, 1901, but did not record its cancellation. <br/><br/>Pedro Regalado, the plaintiff in this action, purchased the warehouse and lot above referred to subsequent to the levy of attachment by Luchsinger &amp; Co. for the sum $15,000, and the instrument of conveyance in his favor was recorded in the register on May 25, 1900. The $15,000 which was the consideration for the sale made by Jose Regalado y Santa Ana to his son Pedro was devoted to the satisfaction of the Bischoff and Montelibano mortgages, transferred, as above stated, to Jose Maria Regalado. <br/><br/>Upon the facts the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the plaintiff, Pedro Regalado, with the costs to the latter, and ordered execution in favor of Luchsinger &amp; Co., as prayed for, against Jose Regalado y Santa Ana for the sum total of their claim, with the interest and costs, and ordered that the warehouse and lot be sold. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance nevertheless recognized Pedro Regalado as a preferred creditor with respect to Luchsinger &amp; Co. for the sum of $15,000, devoted to the payment of the Bischoff and Montelibano mortgages, and decided that this sum, in addition to the expenses of repairs and preservation of the property, less the rents, issues, and profits obtained by him from the said property, should be first paid to the plaintiff, and that the product of the sale should be applied in the second place to the satisfaction of the claim of Luchsinger &amp; Co., and that the balance, if any, should be paid to Pedro Regalado. <br/><br/>The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was the owner of the property attached by the judgment creditors. He did not allege or claim at any time in the course of the proceedings that he was a proferred creditor. The introduction by him into the suit of the Bischoff and Montelibano mortgages was not for the purpose of proving that he had a preferred claim upon the money which might be obtained by the judicial sale of the warehouse and lot, but only to show that he was the real owner of the property attached, purchased for a valuable consideration, and that the sale made to him by his father was a true and not a fictitious sale. <br/><br/>Pedro Regalado intervened in the executive action upon the sole ground that he was the owner of the property attached, and the judicial sale of the property directed by the Court of First Instance was suspended upon this ground — a result which could not have followed had the plaintiff sought to make use of the appropriate remedy available to a preferred creditor. (See arts. 1514, 1517, and 1518, of the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure.) This case was considered and tried by both parties as an intervention under the claim of ownership, and not as an intervention by a preferred creditor. The only question of fact or law raised by the pleadings was that of ownership, and to this issue alone the judgment of the court should have been limited. <br/><br/>The evidence might have been quite sufficient to justify the belief of the learned judge of First Instance that Pedro Regalado was rather a preferred creditor than the owner, but as the claim to a preferred credit with respect to the property of the judgment debtor was not raised by the pleadings, judgment should not have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff upon this consideration of the facts. The purpose of the pleadings according to the Spanish procedure was that of stating therein, in a clear and precise manner, the points of fact and law in controversy between the parties litigant in such a way that the court might be informed of the issues, and that the parties might be prepared to contest the debated points. The court was without authority to raise or decide issues not presented by the pleadings. In this case the question as to whether the plaintiff was or was not a preferred creditor by reason of having paid the Montelibano and Bischoff mortgages was raised by the court itself, and the case was decided upon this issue without previous notice to the parties. The plaintiff may or may not have ground of complaint, but it is certain that the defendants have sufficient reason to object to a judgment which gives to the plaintiff a character which he has never claimed and which, therefore, the appellants had no opportunity to oppose. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is therefore reversed, with the costs to the appellee. In view of the condition of the record we are satisfied that justice requires that the case be returned to the court below for a new trial, and the clerk is directed to remand the case, after the entry of the judgment, in accordance with this decision. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. </div>'\n",

The purchaser agreed to reconvey the carabaos to the vendor at any time within three years from the date of sale on the repayment of the purchase price — the sale to be absolute and the seller to execute the proper credenciales of transfer in case Diamanan failed to make repayment to Alvarez within the time limited, to wit, on or before October 25, 1901. <br/><br/>From the time of the sale so made until the 21st of December, 1900, the property conveyed continued in the possession of the plaintiff. <br/><br/>On the 21st of December, 1900, Leon Montinola, in an executive action prosecuted by him against Rufino Diamanan to recover certain sums of money alleged to be due to him, the said Montinola embargoed 23 head of these carabaos as the property of his debtor Diamanan. <br/><br/>On the 12th of January, 1901, Alvarez commenced the present proceeding of intervention under claim of ownership, alleging that he and not Rufino Diamanan was the owner of the embargoed animals, and demanded that the embargo laid thereon be raised and the property returned to him as the rightful owner thereof. <br/><br/>The court below adjudged that plaintiff’s intervention as the owner of the property embargoed in the executive action prosecuted by Montinola against Diamanan was well founded, and raised and embargo. Montinola appealed. <br/><br/>An examination of the record not having disclosed any error of fact or law the judgment is affirmed, each party to pay his own costs.

From this conviction the defendant appeals. <br/><br/>The defendant having been charged with the abduction executed against the will and with unchaste designs, under the provisions of article 445 could not be convicted of the offense punishable under article 446 of the abduction of a virgin under 23 years of age and over 12, executed with her assent. The latter offense is a distinct and separate crime, and is not included in the former. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of First Instance must be reversed unless the proof is sufficient to sustain the conviction for the offense with which he is charged in the complaint. <br/><br/>An examination of the testimony shows the following facts:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>On the 19th day of February, 1902, Martina Baña, who was then residing with her mother, was sent out to purchase coal oil; she was met by the defendant, who seized her by the hand and placed her in a carromata, and against her will was taken to the house of Valeriana Ponce and there remained about an hour. <br/><br/>From there she went with the defendant to Tondo, and was placed at the house of a friend of the defendant Tagle, and there remained for three days. <br/><br/>She was during this time in company with one Federico Roxas, and the evidence is sufficient to show that the relations between Martina Baña and Federico Roxas were illicit. <br/><br/>She was afterwards taken to the house of one Benito Eusebio in Pasay, where she remained from the 21st of February to the 15th of March. She seems to have been detained there against her will. <br/><br/>She was afterwards taken to the house of the defendant and there again had meetings of an illicit nature with Federico Roxas. <br/><br/>The injured party was a near relative of Teodora Baña, the querida of the defendant, and had formerly lived two years with them as a member their family. <br/><br/>We think the evidence is sufficient to show that the girl was carried off and detained by the defendant against her will, but the injured girl makes a direct and positive denial that the defendant ever said anything or did any act from the time of her abduction to indicate that he personally had any unchaste designs. The circumstances rather indicate that the girl was abducted and held by the defendant for the purpose of lending her to illicit intercourse with other men, and there being a want of this essential element in the case the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction under the provisions of article 445. <br/><br/>For the same reason a conviction could not be sustained if the defendant had been charged with the offense defined and punishable under article 446. <br/><br/>By a decision of the supreme court of Spain of November 16, 1874, article 446 has been construed, and while this article does not prescribe in express terms that the abduction should be with unchaste designs, nevertheless the unchaste designs are said to be inherent to the character of this crime, and it is necessary that they should occur in the act in order to constitute the crime of abduction punishable under this article. <br/><br/>The proof in the case is entirely sufficient to support a conviction under article 444 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Whosoever shall habitually, or, taking advantage of his authority or of another’s trust, promote or facilitate the prostitution or corruption of minors to satisfy the lusts of another, shall be punished with the penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium degrees and absolute temporary disqualification if he were a public official.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendant should have been prosecuted under this article of the Code. <br/><br/>For the reasons above stated we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the Court of First Instance with direction that a complaint be presented against the defendant under the provisions of article 444, and that he be tried proceedings are adjudged de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, concurring in the result. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a motion to dismiss a bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>The appellee’s claim is that the bill of exceptions was signed by the judge and filed in the court below on the 1st day of October; that the certified copy was not filed here until December 3, more than sixty days thereafter, and consequently that it should be dismissed under rule 14. <br/><br/>1. This rule does not make the term of sixty days an improrogable one. On the contrary it says that the court may, for cause shown, extend the time. <br/><br/>The appellant’s claim is that he was not notified of the filing of this bill until October 25, and that, therefore, the time should run from that date. <br/><br/>He also claims that article 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure makes it the duty of the clerk to transmit the copies, and he had a right to rely upon this being done by that official. <br/><br/>We think that the appellant is wrong in both of these claims. He is not entitled to any notice of the filing of the signed bill of exceptions. It is his duty to follow the proceedings in the case and to find out for himself when the bill of exceptions is signed and filed. <br/><br/>It is true that article 143 makes it the duty of the clerk to transmit to this court the certified copy of the bill of exceptions, but he is entitled to receive payment of his fees for making the copies before such transmission is made. By refusing to make such payment an appellant might delay a case indefinitely. To prevent this, rule 14 was adopted. <br/><br/>But notwithstanding the fact that these were mistakes of law on the part of the appellant, we think that under the circumstances they furnish sufficient cause for us to refuse to dismiss the bill. It is a rule of court that we are considering and not a statute. Such a one as this is generally considered as giving the court wide discretionary powers in its application to particular cases. <br/><br/>2. Article 500 of said Code says that a bill of exceptions may be dismissed  \"for unreasonable failure to prosecute or perfect the bill of exceptions.\" But such dismissal shall not  \"be made as a penalty upon lawyer or client for non-compliance with any rule or rules of the court where there has been a substantial compliance with the law prescribing the method of bringing actions into the Supreme Court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In this case the sixty days mentioned in the rule expired on November 30. The copies were not filed until December 3. This delay of three days does not constitute an  \"unreasonable failure to prosecute the bill of exceptions.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>There was, moreover, the substantial compliance with the rule of which article 500 speaks. The delay in question did not prejudice the appellee. To grant his motion would be to impose a penalty upon the appellant for his misconstruction of the rule and certain sections of the Code, a thing which article 500 prohibits us from doing.

The defendant Roman Agapay was acquitted of the charges. <br/><br/>The conviction was under article 408 of the Penal Code, for discharging firearms at the injured party, and article 416 of the same Code for causing serious physical injury to the injured party, by which he was ill and disabled for his usual occupation for a period of more than ninety days. These two articles, in connection with article 89, present a case in which a single act constitutes two or more crimes, and the penalty corresponding to the more serious crime is imposed in its maximum degree. <br/><br/>But the complaint does not charge the offense of discharging firearms at the persons of another, and the judgment is erroneous in convicting the defendants of this offense. <br/><br/>The defense of the defendants in the case was an alibi for each of them. While the proof as to the alibi is well supported by the testimony of witnesses, yet such proof can have little weight when the identify of the defendants as the persons who committed the offense has been fully established by eyewitnesses. <br/><br/>The testimony of both the complainant Sexto Rubio and his wife is direct and positive, identifying the defendants as the persons who committed the acts. They testify that they had known the defendants for a number of years; that the defendants lived in the same town, and they fully identify them as the persons who on the night in question came to the house of Sexto Rubio and committed the offense. <br/><br/>Sexto Rubio testifies that on the night in question the accused Benigno Pascua fired seven shots at him with a revolver, striking and wounding him on the left foot, which incapacitated him for nine months. The accused Juan Baldivino fired three shots at him from a Remington rifle, one shot striking him on the right foot, causing a slight wound which was cured in two days. The accused Remigio Quimangan gave him three blows on the head with a bolo, which caused three wounds, from which he recovered in nine months. The accused Melchor Mangobo also inflicted two wounds upon him by kicking him in the right side and on the shoulder, from the effects of which he recovered in fifteen days, and the accused Bernardino Gampoña was the party who set fire to the house when Pascua and Baldivino were discharging their firearms. <br/><br/>The defendants have made application for discharge under the provisions of the amnesty proclamation of the President of the 4th of July, 1902. <br/><br/>While an examination of the record discloses that the defendants were members of the insurgent army, and there is apparently no motive shown for the commission of the offense, Sexto Rubio testifying that there was no ill feeling between him and the defendants, still there is an entire absence of proof to show that the acts were the result of political dissensions or disturbances. <br/><br/>The defendants will still have opportunity of applying to the Civil Governor for pardon, and presenting such proofs as they may have in support of an application for discharge under the amnesty proclamation. <br/><br/>In view of the fact that there were present in the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstances numbered 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the defendants entered the house of the complainant in the nighttime for that purpose, the judgment of the court below must be reversed as to the conviction of the accused for the offense of discharging firearms, and the defendants Remigio Quimangan, Benigno Pascua, Bernardino Gampoña, and Juan Baldivino are convicted of the crime of lesiones graves, punishable under article 416, section 3, of the Code, for the wounds inflicted upon the complainant, and by which he was ill and disabled from his usual occupation for a period of more than ninety days; and we sentence each of them to the penalty of four years and two months of prision correccional in its maximum degree, with the corresponding accessory penalties, to pay to the injured party $67.50, Mexican, as indemnification, under a joint and several obligation, they to suffer a subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to one-fourth part of the costs each.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 12th day of July, 1898 (record, p.1), Don Domingo Garcia y Casanova filed a complaint in an action of lesser import praying that after the regular procedure judgment be rendered against the defendant, D. Emeterio Ruiz y Urbina, for the payment of the salary accruing in favor of the plaintiff from the 11th of June, 1898, until such time as the plaintiff could return to this city of Manila, together with his passage money, $60 damages, and the costs of the action. The plaintiff alleged that on the 22d of August of the preceding year, 1897, he took command as skipper of the merchant steamer Irene Urbina, under a verbal contract with its owner the defendant Ruiz entered into in this city of Manila, under which the plaintiff was to command the steamer in its voyages between the ports of Misamis and in service as a tug; that this contract did not stipulate the time it was to continue in force or during which the services were to be rendered; that on the 11th of June, 1898, upon the plaintiff’s arrival with the steamer in the port of Lapinig, of the town of Talisayan de Misamis, the shipowner Ruiz wrote him a letter discharging him; that none of the causes which justify the dismissal of the captain or other member of the crew were present; that therefore the defendant Ruiz was under the obligation of paying him the salary of $100 per month which he had been receiving until such time as the plaintiff could return to Manila, together with his passage money, and $60 by way of indemnification for the damages suffered by his having been abandoned at a place where it was impossible for him to support himself by the exercise of his calling; that this claim having been made to the marine authorities the defendant Ruiz in reply denied the right of the plaintiff, and stated among other things that he would only accede to the demand in case the law compelled him to do so, and that the marine authorities had declared themselves to be incompetent to try the case. In support of his complaint, to which he attached two petitions presented to the marine authorities, and the reply of the defendant, the plaintiff cited several articles of the Code of Commerce, the Civil Code, and the law of civil procedure. <br/><br/>On the 13th of July, 1898, the court ordered that service of the complaint be had on the defendant Ruiz. Upon being notified by the justice of the peace of the said town, who delivered him a copy of the summons and of the complaint, the defendant refused to accept the copy of the complaint or to sign the notification. (Record, p. 25.) For this reason, on motion of the plaintiff, the defendant having failed to appear, the latter was declared in default and the complaint admitted as answered. The suit continued its course, and the decision was notified by reading in open court in accordance with the provisions of articles 265 and 266, in addition to the publication of the edicts prescribed by article 267 of the law of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>Upon the grounds set forth in the order of August 27 of the same year, made on motion of the plaintiff, the parties were cited to appear on the 31st of that month. At the time set no one appeared except the plaintiff and his attorney, who stated that in view of the allegations of law and fact set forth in his client’s pleadings he believed that the question at issue was solely one of law, and that, therefore, in view of the tacit admission on the part of the defendant Ruiz of the facts alleged in the complaint nothing was to be done other than to determine the question of law to be passed upon by the court in rendering judgment in accordance with Garcia’s complaint. <br/><br/>On motion of plaintiff an order was made for the attachment of the real and personal property of Ruiz in the sum of $700. No personality having been found, a preventative annotation was by judicial mandate entered on the books of Recorder of Property showing the attachment of a house of substantial material with an iron roof, belonging to Don Emeterio Ruiz, situated in the square of the town of Tagoloan of the said district. (Record, pp. 54 and 55.) On motion of the plaintiff personal service of the judgment rendered in the action was had on the defendant Ruiz, who thereupon filed written notice of appeal (Record, p. 50) to the former Audiencia, which appeal was allowed by an order entered on folio 61. <br/><br/>The original record was sent up, both parties entered their appearance, and the abstract of the case was prepared. At this stage of the proceedings counsel for the appellant Ruiz raised an incidental issue in the appellate court by asking that all the proceedings in the action from and after the order of August 8, 1898, entered on page 21 of the record, be set aside, advancing such argument in support of this motion as seemed to him available. This petition was opposed by the appellee, whereupon after notice to the parties the incidental issue was decided by judgment of the 15th of November, 1900, denying the annulment solicited by the appellant, but without special judgment for costs. <br/><br/>This action of lesser import was prosecuted against the defendant Ruiz in default, he not having appeared to answer the complaint, notwithstanding service upon him of the order, directing that a copy of the complaint and the summons be delivered to him, and after the expiration of the respective terms of eighteen and nine days which were successively granted him for that purpose. The order declaring him in default and the complaint admitted, as well as subsequent orders, were all notified by reading the same in open court, with the exception of the judgment, of which personal service was had, on motion of the plaintiff. (Articles 665, 668, and 752 of the old Code of Civil Procedure.) <br/><br/>The documents attached as exhibits to the complaint show that the defendant Ruiz was fully aware of the terms of the complaint as also of the facts therein alleged, because the written claim filed by Garcia with the governor of the district as subdelegate of the marine authorities, which claim was subsequently reproduced in the complaint upon the same statement of facts, was replied to by the defendant Ruiz by a statement of the reasons for his conduct, and subsequently upon being cited and notified to appear in the court of Misamis to answer to it in due form he refused to accept a copy of the complaint or to sign an acknowledgment of services, thereby voluntarily becoming in default, inasmuch as he absolutely failed to appear and did not allege that he was prevented by force majeure from doing so. <br/><br/>Upon this supposition, nothing having occured to have prevented him from appearing in the action to defend himself against the facts alleged by the plaintiff, the silence of the defendant must be taken as an admission to these facts. The question is therefore reduced to determining whether the plaintiff Garcia was entitled to receive his salary from the 11th of June, 1898, at the rate of $100 per month, until his return to the city of Manila, in which place the contract was entered into under which he was to command the steamer Irene Urbina as skipper, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant Ruiz as shipowner discharged him on the day mentioned in the month of June. <br/><br/>The principle established by article 604 of the Code of Commerce is a legislative sanction and recognition of Garcia’s right; nothing appearing in any way tending to deprive him of his unquestionable right to receive his salary until his return to the port where his contract for an unlimited time was entered into, and consequently the propriety of his claim is unquestionable. (Article 636 of the Code of Commerce.) <br/><br/>The judge of first instance in his decision limited the right of the plaintiff to receive his salary to the time of the notification of the judgment, which took place on the 12th of September, 1898, and it does not appear that Garcia has taken any exception to this decision. <br/><br/>The defendant did nothing but appeal from the judgment rendered against him by default, and upon the record his counsel in the appellate court raised the incidental issue of the annulment of the proceedings in the court below from page 21 of the record forward; but the former Audiencia denied appellant’s motion to set aside the proceedings by its decision of November 15, 1900, upon the grounds expressed in said order. We are therefore precluded from discussing in this decision the formal defects or errors of procedure which have thus been passed upon by a final decision. On the other hand, no other error complained of appearing in the appealed judgment, we are of the opinion, on the foregoing grounds, that the same must be affirmed, with the costs against the appellant, and it is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The appellant has been convicted of asesinato in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, and sentenced to death. He now asks that he be declared entitled to the benefit of the amnesty offered by the President’s proclamation of July 4 last, and the Solicitor-General is conformable to the granting of the petition. <br/><br/>For the purpose of passing upon the petition we assume that the guilt of the petitioner has been sufficiently proved. The case presented will then be as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The petitioner in March, 1900, was understood to be the president of the pueblo of Mangatarem, in the Province of Pangasinan, under the Filipino revolutionary government. some time in that month he either himself killed or caused to be killed, under circumstances which are not disclosed by the evidence, two unknown persons, who were suspected of being spies of the Americans. Though there is no direct evidence to that effect, we think it may be fairly inferred that these persons were native Filipinos. We regard it as a conclusion which may be legitimately drawn from such facts as appear in the case that they were put to death solely because they favored the Americans or had rendered services to the American Army. <br/><br/>There is no evidence tending to show that the petitioner, in putting these persons to death, acted under the orders of any superior authority. <br/><br/>The President’s proclamation grants an amnesty  \"for the offenses of treason and sedition, and for all offenses political in their character committed in the course of such insurrections [that against the Kingdom of Spain and that against the Government of the United States] pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities, or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities, or which resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The amnesty covers, then, three classes of offenses, namely, (1) purely political crimes, compendiously described in the proclamation as  \"treason and sedition,\" (2) common crimes  \"political in their character,\" that is, committed in furtherance of the interest of the insurrection, if committed pursuant to orders from superior authority, and (3) crimes which are shown to have had their origin in the two classes of  \"internal political feuds or dissensions\" named, without reference to whether they are in their nature political or common crimes, or common crimes of a political character, and without reference to whether they were committed under orders of a superior authority or not. <br/><br/>The present case clearly falls outside of both the first and second of these categories. The question to be decided is whether it is embraced within the third. <br/><br/>The phrase  \"internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves\" is somewhat vague and indeterminate, and hence not free from obscurity. It is necessary to attach some meaning to it, and that meaning must not be a narrow and restricted one, repugnant to the nature of the proclamation, which as an act of grace should, where the language admits of doubt, be construed in accordance with the rule favorabilia sunt amplianda. <br/><br/>The most wide-reaching and significant of the internal political dissensions by which the Filipinos were divided among themselves during the recent insurrection was that which separated those who resisted from those who supported the Government of the United States. It is well known that many of the latter class were murdered by their fellow-countrymen on account of their political sympathies. We see no sufficient ground upon which to hold that the author of the proclamation intended to exclude these and similar crimes from the scope of the amnesty, while including crimes which had their origin in minor feuds or dissensions between opposing factions of insurgents or between those Filipinos who favored forcible resistance to the United States Government and those who advocated the attainment of independence by peaceable agitation. <br/><br/>In the case of United States v. Isidro Guzman, and others, decided October 10, 1902, the petitioners, Isidro and Jose Guzman, had been convicted of the murder of Piera, a Spanish lieutenant, held by the insurgents as a prisoner of war, the motive of the crime having been purely one of personal hatred engendered by the action which Piera had taken about a year previously as juez instructor in a military prosecution of a political character against the petitioner’s father. We held in that case that the crime was one which grew out of  \"internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities\" within the meaning of the phrase in question where the feud or dissension is between Filipinos and Spaniards and limit it where only Filipinos are concerned. <br/><br/>In United States, v. Catalino Ortiz and others, decided November 4, 1902, a Filipino charged with being a spy of the Americans was put to death by the petitioners, who were members of an insurgent force. In that case it appeared that the petitioners were acting under orders of superior authority, and our holding that they were entitled to the benefit of the amnesty might well have been rested exclusively upon that ground, but in the opinion of the court by Torres, <em>J.</em>, it is said that the  \"murder in question has a political character, and was the result of political hatred or of dissensions of that nature among Filipinos.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In United States v. Marcelo de Guzman, decided November 11, 1902, the petitioner, a captain in the insurgent army caused Pelagio Bonifacio to be put to death as a spy of the Spaniards. The petitioner testified that he had received direct orders from his superior in command to put Bonifacio to death. In the opinion of the majority of the court by Cooper, <em>J.</em>, it is said:  \"This statement as to the defendant having received direct orders from Vicente Prado for the execution of the deceased is not borne out by the testimony of the witnesses, who state that no sooner had the deceased been brought in the presence of the defendant than the deceased was struck by the defendant and ordered to be taken off and shot.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"However, it appears beyond doubt that the commission of the offense was done by the defendant as an officer in the insurgent army, and that it grew out of internal political feuds and dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards, or out of the political feuds and dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during the Spanish insurrection,\" and the decision granting the amnesty would appear to be placed on that ground. It is true that there was evidence in that case that Prado had directed the petitioner  \"to look out for a spy in the pueblo of Binmaley, and when found to have him executed,\" and the minority of the court were of opinion that, relying upon this evidence, the case should be regarded as that of a crime of a political character committed pursuant to orders of a superior authority. <br/><br/>Although neither the Ortiz case nor the Marcelo de Guzman case can perhaps be regarded as a direct authority for the granting of the present petition, we are not inclined to recede from the views expressed in those cases, which we think are in accord with a sound interpretation of the proclamation. <br/><br/>The petitioner is accordingly declared to be entitled to the benefit of the amnesty, and will be discharged upon filing the required oath, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, dissenting. </div>'\n",

In compliance with this order the fiscal presented a written argument, stating therein that he did not think the evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction, and asked that the case be dismissed. The written argument of the counsel for the defendant merely expressed his agreement with the opinion of the fiscal. The court rendered a decision acquitting two of the defendants and convicting two. One of the latter, Santiago Regino, having appealed, now moves this court that the judgment be reversed and the cause dismissed because the fiscal in the court below withdrew the complaint and that without a complaint no judgment could be lawfully rendered. <br/><br/>The motion will have to be denied for two reasons: (1) The action of the fiscal was not a withdrawal of the complaint. It was simply his opinion upon the merits of the case which the court required him to present. (2) Even if it had been an attempted withdrawal, it would have been ineffectual. After the complaint has been presented, and certainly after the trial has been commenced, the court and not the fiscal has full control of it.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In March, 1876, Don Antonio Roa presented to the court of First Instance of Cebu a petition asking for an extension of the time for the payment of his debts. A meeting of his creditors was accordingly called, the written proposition submitted to them by him was accepted by them, and approved by the court. The proceedings were taken in strict conformity with the provisions of articles 506 to 518 of the Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil of 1855. Although that law was not in force in these Islands the court considered it as a legal doctrine. The proposition accepted by the required majority of the creditors provided for an extension of five years; that Don Antonio Samson should guarantee the debts of Don Antonio Roa, and should have the administration of the latter’s property during the five years, or such time as might be necessary for the payment of the debts. All of the property both of Roa and Samson was mortgaged to secure the performance of the obligations. The sixth clause of the proposition was as follows:  \"Don Antonio Samson may acquire for himself, for two-thirds of the estimated value expressed in the preceding clause, the realty and all other property he may select, and as owner thereof he may convey or mortgage, but shall be a guarantor for the amount thereof and shall be liable to the creditors; whatever may be left over after the payment of all the credits which Samson may guarantee shall belong to Don Antonio Roa, and shall be devoted to the payment of his indebtedness to Doña Francisca Casa de Roa.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The order of the court approving the action of the creditors directed the property to be delivered to Antonio Samson. <br/><br/>Don Antonio Roa died in February, 1886. On May 19 of the same year Don Antonio Samson by a public writing conveyed the estate in question to the defendant. The purchase price was a debt of the defendant against Roa for $1,800, which amounted at the date of the conveyance, with interest, to $4,800. The estate belonged to Antonio Roa, was included in the inventory of his property which he filed with his petition for an extension, and was appraised therein at $24,809.64. <br/><br/>In 1896 the plaintiff, a grandson and heir of Don Antonio Roa, commenced this action against the defendant, claiming that the conveyance of 1886 was insufficient to pass the title to the defendant, and asking that the estate be delivered to him for himself and his coheirs. <br/><br/>Judgment was rendered in the court below annuling that conveyance, canceling the inscription, and directing the estate to be delivered not to the plaintiff but to the creditors. From this judgment the defendant appealed. <br/><br/>The determination of the appeal turns, in our opinion, upon the proper construction of clause 6, above quoted. We construe that clause as consisting of two distinct parts. By it Don Antonio Samson was given the right to but for himself this or any other property of Roa for two-thirds of the value placed upon it in the inventory. This provision if complete in itself, and it was intended to give Samson a right which otherwise he would not have, no administrator being able to buy for himself the property which he administers, a prohibition now contained in article 1459 of the Civil Code. The remainder of this clause is also complete in itself. It gives to Samson the right to sell, as owner, any of the property, accounting to the creditors for the price received. The construction claimed for the appellee can not be sustained. He contends that the second part of the clause is a continuation of the first, and that it is only those goods which he has elected to take for himself at two-thirds of their appraised value that he has the right to sell as owner. <br/><br/>(1)\tSuch a construction would render useless the second part of the clause. If he had acquired for himself this or any other estate at two-thirds of its value and had paid for it he would have had the right to dispose of it as owner, and no declaration to that effect was needed in the agreement. <br/><br/>(2)\tThe works  \"su importe\" are inconsistent with such construction. If they mean the two-thirds of the appraised value they are unnecessary, for it was of course assumed that Samson must answer to the creditors for said purchase price if he elected to take any property upon those terms. If they refer to the price received in a sale by Samson to a third person they would render the right of purchase given in the first part of no value; for, if Samson took this estate at two-thirds of its value, that is $16,000, and afterwards sold it for $20,000, he would have to account to the creditors for the whole $20,000. If he took it for $16,000 and sold it for $8,000 he still would have to account to the creditors for $16,000, for he had no right to take it for himself at all except on the payment of two-thirds of its value. The construction thus eliminates the words  \"para si\" from the contract. <br/><br/>(3)\tThe clause requiring what remains to the returned to Roa also indicates that the property was not to be kept intact, but that Samson was to have the right to sell it to pay the debts. <br/><br/>The language of the conveyance of 1886, delivered to the defendant, is entirely consistent with the view which we have taken of this clause. The grantor is therein described as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The said Don Antonio Samson in his said capacity as administrator, liquidator, and surety of the said Antonio Roa, and availing himself of the authority conferred upon him by the sixth clause of the said proposition . . .\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>There is nothing whatever in the record to show what the state of accounts is between Samson and Roa or how many of the creditors have been paid. It may be that the plaintiff or the creditors have the right to demand of the heirs of Samson a statement as to his administration of the goods of Roa. But whatever rights of that kind they may have, they can exercise none versus the defendant. Under our construction of Clause 6 Samson as administrator had the right to dispose of this estate. The conveyance of 1886 was sufficient at that time to transfer the title of the defendant. He is, therefore, the owner of the property. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and the action dismissed without costs. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">In the decision in this case it is found as a fact that the titles to the steamer Balayan and the coasting vessel Ogoño are registered in the name of the defendant. It must be assumed from this that the defendant has the legal title to the vessels, as without it they could not be so registered. <br/><br/>These facts standing alone show that the defendant is the owner of the property. <br/><br/>Two other facts, however, appear in the decision which the appellee claims warranted the court below in deciding that the defendant was not the owner. <br/><br/>1. The court found that the money with which the vessels were purchased was furnished by the plaintiff, the father of the defendant. Does this fact make him the owner of them, the title having been taken and registered in the son’s name?<br/><br/>The various ways in which the title to property may be acquired are stated in article 609 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>The plaintiff never acquired the title to these vessels in any one of the ways therein described. He did not acquire it by donation or succession. He did not acquire it by means of any contract. <br/><br/>The court does not find that the father and son had between themselves any contract of any kind by virtue of the son agreed to transfer the title to the father or to hold it for his benefit. <br/><br/>There is an allegation in the complaint that the defendant acted as the agent of the plaintiff in the purchase. This is denied in the answer and there is no finding in the decision which supports this allegation of the complaint. <br/><br/>There is only the bare fact that the price of property which was conveyed to the defendant by a third person was paid by the plaintiff. It can not be said that the law by reason of this fact transfers any title or interest in the thing itself to the plaintiff. <br/><br/>Article 1090 of the Civil Code provides that  \"obligations derived from the law are not to be presumed. Only those expressly provided for in this Code or in special laws are enforceable.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It is provided in Article 161 of the same Code, relating to minors, that  \"the ownership or enjoyment of property acquired by a minor child with funds of his parents, pertain to the latter.\" This article does not apply to the present case, for the son was of age. <br/><br/>This is the only provision which we have found anywhere in the laws now in force that declares the property to belong to the person who paid the money. <br/><br/>Nor can such general doctrine be found in the former law. Law 49, title 5, partida 5, the effect of which is incorrectly stated in the brief of the appellee, expressly provided that property bought with another’s money should not belong to the owner of the money except in certain enumerated cases of which this is not one. <br/><br/>Law 48, title 5, partida 5, also expressly provided that where one bought with his own money property the title to which he procured to be transferred to a third person, such third person had the right to keep it by reimbursing the other for his outlay. <br/><br/>It may be true that the laws in some of the United States would in this case raise a resulting trust in favor of the plaintiff. But such laws are not in force here; and whatever other right the plaintiff may have against the defendant, either for the recovery of the money paid or for damages, it is clear that such payment gave him no title either legal or equitable to these vessels. <br/><br/>If there were evidence in the case which would have justified the court below in finding that the defendant acted as the agent of the plaintiff or that there was some other contract between them, he should have incorporated such findings in his decision. <br/><br/>Article 133 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires the court to file a written decision. If the facts stated in that decision together with those admitted in the pleadings are not sufficient as a matter of law to support the judgment, it must be reversed, if excepted to. <br/><br/>The record, however, contains all the evidence and an examination of it shows that no such findings would have been warranted. As to the Balayan, it appears that the son had nothing whatever to do with its purchase. It was bought by the father with the money of the conjugal partnership, and the title by his direction placed in the son’s name. <br/><br/>As to the Ogoño, the father’s intervention in the purchase nowhere appears. He simply testified that it was bought with his money. <br/><br/>It is said that the court below found as a fact that the father was the owner of the vessels and that we can not disturb this finding because there was no motion for a new trial. This contention can not be sustained. The ultimate question in the whose case was: Who owned this property? The resolution of that question depended upon the application of legal principles to the facts connected with its acquisition and subsequent management. Those facts were that the father bought and paid for it, and that the titles to it were taken and registered in the son’s name. A statement that by reason of these facts the father is the owner is a statement of law and not a finding of fact. <br/><br/>2. It was found as a fact the father had exercised acts of ownership over the vessel. That finding is entirely consistent with the legal ownership by the son. The exercise of such acts could not transfer such ownership from the son. <br/><br/>3. There is in the record a letter written by the defendant to the plaintiff in which the latter is asked if he desires to sell the Balayan. This letter is not incorporated into the findings and we have no right to consider it. But, if we had, it would not in our opinion change the result. Such a letter might well have been written by a son to a father, both of them recognizing the fact that the son was the owner of the property as to which the inquiry was made. <br/><br/>4. In conclusion we may say that even on the supposition that a written and recorded title to vessels may be overcome by parol evidence, that offered in this case was insufficient to accomplish such a result. As to the Balayan, there is nothing whatever to show why the father placed the title in his son’s name. It may have been either as a gift or a loan. As to the Ogoño, there is the simple declaration of the father that he paid for it. This may have been either a gift or a loan. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and a new trial is granted with costs against the appellee. <br/><br/>Torres, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>This action was brought by Don Francisco Martinez against Don Pedro Martinez, the appellant, for the recovery as owner of two certain vessels, the steamship Balayan and the schooner Ogoño. <br/><br/>The plaintiff brings the suit for himself and in representation of his deceased wife, alleging that the ships were bought with funds belonging to the community estate. <br/><br/>The defendant in his answer claims that he is the exclusive owner of the ships, basing his right to such ownership upon their registration in his name in the office of the Captain of the Port, and further, that the ships were purchased with his individual money. <br/><br/>The first assignment of error is that  \"the court erred in adjudging the ownership of the property of the ships Balayan and Ogoño to Don Francisco Martinez, the latter not having presented written documents of the acquisition of said ships nor certificates of incsription in the registry.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>1. This assignment of error raises the question of the sufficiency of the proof to sustain the judgment of the court below and requires an examination of the evidence taken in the court below and a trial of the questions of fact as to the ownership of the property. <br/><br/>Section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that in the hearings upon bills of exceptions in civil actions and special proceedings, the Supreme Court shall not review the evidence taken in the court below nor retry the questions of fact except as in that section provided, which are in the following cases:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tWhere assessors have sat with the judge and both assessors are of the opinion that the findings of fact and judgment are wrong and have certified their dissent. <br/><br/>(2)\tUpon the ground of the discovery of new and material evidence. <br/><br/>(3)\tWhere the excepting party files a motion in the Court of First Instance for a new trial upon the grounds that the findings of fact are plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence and the judge overrules the motion and die exception was taken to his overruling the same. <br/><br/>There was no motion for a new trial in the Court of First Instance, not is it contended that this case falls within either of the other exceptions. <br/><br/>It is insisted that while this court will not review or retry questions of fact, yet if it appears from the findings of fact as contained in the decision of the lower court that the facts do not justify the judgment or conclusions of law the case will be reversed for a new trial. <br/><br/>There was no exception taken to the judgment, the exception being only such as is inferred from the presentation and allowance of the bill of exceptions. <br/><br/>This is not sufficient to justify this court in entertaining such objection; the rule is that were a judgment is entered not warranted by the findings the proper remedy is by application to the court in which it is entered to correct or vacate the judgment, and unless the action of the court has been thus invoked the petition will not be considered on appeal. (Scott v. Minneapolis R. R. Co., 42 Minn., 179). <br/><br/>But had the exception been properly taken an examination of the findings clearly shows that the judgment is sustained by them. The following findings of fact were made by the lower court and are contained in the judgment, to wit:  \"I am of the opinion that Don Francisco Martinez, for himself and in representation of his wife, is the actual and true owner of said steamship and schooner and has exercised over them acts of ownership and dominion, and that these ships were bought with the funds by him furnished. With respect to the fact that the steamship and schooner may have been registered in the name of the defendant, Pedro Martinez, it is my opinion that this fact can not be considered as prejudicial to the true right of the plaintiff.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>An analysis of this finding will show that it consists of the finding of, first, an ultimate fact, that is, that the plaintiff D. Francisco Martinez is the actual and true owner of the steamship and schooner, the property in controversy; second, the probative fact that he has exercised over them acts of ownership and dominion and that these ships were bought with funds furnished by him, and, third, the probative fact that the ships were registered in the name of the defendant, Pedro Martinez. <br/><br/>The majority of the court regard the first finding — that is, that the plaintiff is the actual and true owner of the property in controversy — as a statement of law and not a finding of fact, and have rejected it as a finding of fact. In reversing the case for a new trial the decision is based upon the finding that the vessels are registered in the name of the defendant, and it is said that it must be assumed that the defendant has a title to the vessels as without it they could not be so registered. <br/><br/>The conclusion I reach is the reverse of that reached by the court. The finding of the plaintiff’s ownership of the vessel and schooner is not a conclusion of law, but is the finding of an ultimate fact in the case, and was the proper and the only finding that could have been made. As stated in the opinion, the ultimate question in the whole case was, Who owned this property?<br/><br/>The supreme court of Minnesota has passed upon the precise question in the case of Common v. Grace (36 Minn., 276). The finding of the lower court in that case was that  \"John Grace was, at the time of his death, the owner in fee simple of the real estate.\" The appellant made a request in the court below for additional findings. Upon the refusal of the lower court to make such additional findings it was assigned as error on appeal. Mitchell, <em>J.</em>, says:  \"The facts required to be found are the ultimate facts forming the issued presented by the pleadings and which constitute the foundation of a judgment and not those which are simply evidentiary of them. The court is not required to find merely evidentiary facts or to set forth and explain the means or processes by which it arrived at such findings. Neither evidence, argument, nor comment has any legitimate place in the findings of fact. The test of the sufficiency of the findings of fact by a court, we apprehend, is, Would they answer if presented by a jury in the form of a special verdict, which is required to present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them, and to present those conclusions of fact so that nothing remains to the court but to draw from them conclusion of law? In the case at bar the finding of fact that John Grace was, at the time of his death, the owner in fee simple of the real estate in question was the ultimate fact upon which the decision of the case depended. It covered the only issue in the case, and was a sufficient foundation for a judgment in favor of defendants. It could only be arrived at upon the hypothesis that the deeds in dispute were duly executed, and the finding necessarily implied and included this.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In the case of Daly v. Socorro (80 Cal., 367) it is said:  \"The appellant further contends that the cause should be reversed because the court failed to find upon certain other issues presented. His right to maintain the action was based wholly upon his ownership and right of possession, and these being found against him it is immaterial to him whether the court found as to other facts or not, as the judgment must have been against him whatever the other finding might have been.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The finding of the court that the ships were registered in the name of the defendant is the finding only of a probative or evidentiary fact, that is, it is the finding simply of evidence tending to prove the ultimate fact, to wit, the fact of ownership. The various means of proving this ultimate fact is the evidence. Thus, a bill of sale is evidence of ownership. The possession of property is prima facie evidence of ownership, and so perhaps is the registry of ship evidence of the ownership of the person in whose name it is made; but while it is evidence tending to prove ownership, there may be other evidence in the case totally destroying its value, such as a sale and conveyance of the ship by the owner or person in whose name it is registered made subsequent to the date of the registration; title by prescription as against the party in whose name the ship is registered; by proof that the party in whose name the ship is registered held the title simply as agent of the party claiming ownership. For this reason the finding that the vessels are registered in the name of the defendant is inconclusive and is entirely insufficient as a finding of fact. <br/><br/>The finding of fact must be such as includes the entire issue or the ultimate fact to be proven, and in this case, as is stated in the opinion, the ultimate question in the whole case was who owned this property. The lower court has responded to this issue by saying that  \"while the ships are registered in the name of the defendant that this fact can not be considered as prejudicial to the direct ownership of the plaintiff. That D. Francisco Martinez, the plaintiff, for himself and in representation of his wife, is the actual and true owner of said ships and has exercised over them acts of ownership and dominion.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>There is not conflict in the findings, for, as stated by the lower court, the ship may be registered in the name of the defendant and still be owned by the plaintiff. But, if any such conflict exists, then the finding of the ultimate fact that the ownership is with the plaintiff. <br/><br/>When the ultimate fact is found no finding of probative facts which may tend to establish that the ultimate fact was found against the evidence can overcome the finding of the ultimate fact. (Smith v. Acker, 52 Cal., 217; Perry v. Quackenbush, 105 Cal., 299; Smith v. Jones, 131 Ind.) <br/><br/>Not only is the ultimate fact of ownership which is the paramount finding in the case allowed to be overthrown by the less important and subsidiary finding of the evidentiary fact of registration of the ship, but the opinion wholly ignores the other finding of the probative fact, that is, that the plaintiff has exercised acts of ownership and dominion over the property and that the ships were purchased with funds furnished by him. <br/><br/>II. It is said in the opinion in referring to a letter written by the defendant to the plaintiff that this letter is not incorporated in the findings and we have no right to consider it, yet the court in its decision has gone into an examination of the evidence thus improperly brought here. <br/><br/>This ambiguity in the opinion makes it necessary to refer briefly to the evidence. Such review will show that the evidence before the lower court was entirely sufficient to support the finding of ownership in the plaintiff. It consists of letters written to the plaintiff by his agents, Armstrong &amp; Sloan, who acted for him in the purchase of the ship Balayan; the testimony of the plaintiff as to his purchase an payment of the price of the ship; proof of witnesses of the acts of ownership on the part of the plaintiff after the purchase of the ships by him; that the defendant resided with the plaintiff, who was his father, and that the defendant had no means with which to make such purchase; various acts of the defendant recognizing the plaintiff’s ownership in the vessel; evidence introduced on the part of the plaintiff tending to show his ownership and tending to show that the defendant acted simply as plaintiff’s agent in the control which he exercised over the ship. <br/><br/>In one of the letters written by Armstrong &amp; Sloan to the plaintiff dated August 22, 1892, they say:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"We have credited to your account $18,843.65 which you left before your departure for the cost of the ship bought for you in Hongkong.\" Also the book entries in the mercantile office of Armstrong &amp; Sloan, in which appear the following:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Cash, August, 1892. <br/><br/>Aug. 24. Francisco Martinez, received from him account<br/><br/>of cost of one launch in Hongkong\t$18,843.65<br/><br/>Cash, September, 1892. <br/><br/>Sept. 13.

With respect to the steamship Balayan, Señor Sloan sends word to you that there is an American who wishes to purchase it for 24,000 pesos, and asks whether you desire to sell it or not that you reply because he awaits your answer . . .\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It also appears in evidence that the ship Balayan had the initials of the plaintiff  \"F. M.\" on the smokestack, and that at some recent date the defendant had caused these initials to be erased and those of his own substituted. <br/><br/>The defendant for a number of years managed the plaintiff’s business under a general power of attorney, and was a member of his family, and such acts of ownership as he exercised over these ships may be properly referred to this authority. <br/><br/>When the relationship of the parties — that is, that of son and father — is considered in connection with other proof in the case, the conclusion is irresistible that the ships are owned by the plaintiff and that there has been a most flagrant abuse on the part of the defendant of a father’s confidence. <br/><br/>For the reason above stated I dissent from the decision. </div>'\n",

It would require very convincing evidence in any case to establish a defense of this character, and in the present record we discover nothing which can fairly be said to have even a remote tendency in that direction. <br/><br/>It appears that two and perhaps three of the robbers carried arms; as to the fourth — the defendant — the evidence seems to indicate that he was not armed. The party, therefore, did not constitute a cuadrilla in the sense of the law (art. 505 of the Penal Code; judgment of the supreme court of Spain of May 22, 1871), and the judgment of the court below, basing the conviction upon the article cited, is so far erroneous. <br/><br/>The defendant is guilty of the crime of robo as defined and punished in article 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code; the time and place of the commission of the crime constitute aggravating circumstances (art. 10, Nos. 15 and 20); the defendant is accordingly sentenced to eight years of presidio mayor. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below will be modified in accordance with this opinion, and affirmed in other respects with costs.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The present case, No. 81, from the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal is now before us on appeal by defendant from the judgment of February 5, 1902, whereby he was sentenced to imprisonment for one year four months and twenty-one days and 2,001 pesetas fine, or in default thereof to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and costs of suit, for the falsification of a private document. Counsel for defendant claims that the accused is guilty of no offense, and certainly not of that of falsification with which he stands charged. The Solicitor-General, for the reasons advanced in his brief, prayed that the appealed judgment be reversed and the whole proceedings in the case declared null and void, costs of both instances to be borne by the Government. <br/><br/>The criminal act which is the subject-matter of this prosecution as charged in the complaint filed by the prosecuting attorney on January 14, 1902, has the characteristics of the crime of estafa, defined and punished in article 534 and article 535, No. 1 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>It is a settled principle, established for the proper and correct application of the provisions of the Penal Code in regard to the crimes of estafa and falsification of private documents, that the mere simulation or fiction of a receipt, letter, note, or any other private document, committed with fraudulent intent, should it appear that there was no attempt made to imitate the writing and signature of the supposed maker of the document does not constitute the offense of falsification of a private document, but that of estafa, and it is held that the note or document used was the means selected by the agent for the commission of the offense known as estafa since the deceit which, together with the injury caused, constitutes one of the principal elements of the above-mentioned offense against property, could not otherwise exist. <br/><br/>This case involves the simulation of a note apparently signed by  \"J. Fernandez,\" but as it has not been shown that defendant attempted to counterfeit or imitate the true authentic signature of  \"Juan Fernandez,\" it is evident that there was no falsification of any private document. The accused availed himself of the bogus note in order to obtain from the aggrieved party, Simeon Blas, through false representations, the amount of 20 pesos receipted for by the accused under an assumed name and signature. <br/><br/>Upon these facts a complaint was filed against the defendant, Felix Balmori, charging him with the crime of estafa, setting forth in detail the acts committed by the accused, while at the end of the said complaint it is stated that the offense charged is that of falsification of a document. <br/><br/>This double classification of the offense is inconsistent with the provisions of section 5, No. 2, and section 11 of General Orders, No. 58, because the act in question constitutes a single offense and it should be specifically designated in the complaint. <br/><br/>At the opening of the trial the provincial fiscal agreed with counsel for defendant, with the consent of the judge, that the complaint be amended so as to charge defendant with the falsification of a private document instead of estafa, and under these circumstances the court proceeded to hear the evidence. After hearing argument by the fiscal and by counsel for the accused, the court declared that the crime of falsification had been committed, found the accused guilty thereof, and rendered the judgment already mentioned. <br/><br/>An examination of the record in this case will show not only a discrepancy between the complaint and the result of the evidence, but that an error was committed in charging the proper offense, even after it had been corrected or amended. This error was sustained in the appealed judgment, but as this court reviews the evidence of the offense of which the accused is charged, we can not approve of the denomination given the offense in question, nor can we sentence the defendant for a crime which he has not really committed. A new trial should be had upon the filing of a new complaint for estafa. The former proceedings are wholly null and void in all parts subsequent to the complaint, wherefore, in view of the provisions of sections 27 and 37, General Orders, No. 58, the judgment of the court below is set aside and all proceedings subsequent to page 21 of the record are declared void; the cost of suit to be borne by the Government. The judge, upon the filing of a new complaint for estafa, shall proceed in accordance with law. It is so ordered and adjudged. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

Jose Regalado Santa Ana, the holder of the mortgage, on the one part, and D. Pedro Regalado Montelibano on the other part, entered into a contract before a notary public, by which the said above-named mortgage with the interest due thereon from the 4th day of December, 1891, was transferred and assigned to Don Pedro Regalado Montelibano, and in this contract so entered into Don Jose Regalado Santa Ana acknowledged the receipt from Don Pedro Regalado of the amount of $5,259.33, as well as an amount corresponding to the interest of 15 per cent per annum due on the principal. <br/><br/>On the 3d day of November, 1900, Don Pedro Regalado Montelibano by virtue of the right which he had acquired by the transfer and assignment above mentioned instituted against the defendant an executive action before the judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. <br/><br/>The suit having been admitted, the Court of First Instance proceeded to embargo the mortgaged property. The defendants entered their opposition to the proceedings in due time and form, which was based upon the following points:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tThat the mortgaged property being situated in the Island of Negros the court of Iloilo was without power to issue execution. <br/><br/>(2)\tThat the notice of the transfer or assignment of the debt was not given to the defendants as is required by law. <br/><br/>(3)\tThat it is not stated in the mortgage document that the parties expressly submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court of Iloilo. <br/><br/>(4)\tThat the requisites of the law with reference to the inscription in the mortgage registry of property have not been complied with. <br/><br/>(5)\tThat it is not alleged in the complaint that there is any fixed amount due to the creditor. <br/><br/>(6)\tThat the appraisement of the mortgaged property was not made before the embargo as is required by law. <br/><br/>(7)\tThat by reason of the transfer of cession of the credit by Don Jose Regalado Santa Ana to Don Pedro Regalado Montelibano the debt of the defendants was extinguished, and therefore Don Jose Regalado had nothing to transfer. <br/><br/>(8)\tThat article 169 of Regulations for the Execution of the Mortgage Law was not complied with in that it is not stated in the complaint that the credit is liable to indemnify any loss or damage caused the debtor or third persons interested by reason of the malice or negligence in the true statement of facts, and of the circumstances the judge must take into consideration to authorize the proceedings and to continue them. <br/><br/>On the 10th day of February, 1902, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo rendered a judgment in which it found as a matter of fact that the mortgaged property was situated in the Island of Negros, and that no part was situated in the Province of Iloilo, and also finding that the value of the mortgaged property was not shown, nor had any appraisement of the same been made, and basing his judgment upon these facts declared that the Court of First Instance did not have the competency, and was without jurisdiction, to try the case, and dismissed the executive action; raised the preventative embargo, and ordered the property in question to be returned to the control of the defendants, and directed that Augustin Yulo, the administrator in whose custody the property had been placed, should render to the defendants an exact and true account of the rents, products, and profits of the mortgaged property, and condemning the plaintiff to the payment of costs, damages, and injuries which had been occasioned to the defendants by the proceedings. <br/><br/>Against this judgment Don Pedro Regalado has interposed an appeal to this court. <br/><br/>We will consider the question upon which the judgment of the Court of First Instance is based:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The action being instituted both for the purpose of obtaining a personal judgment against the defendants and to obtain an order for the sale of real estate in satisfaction of the debt, is, in its nature, a mixed action.

(Judgment of November 22, 1858, Supreme Court.) <br/><br/>By paragraph 4, of article 46, Spanish Code of Civil Procedure, it is provided that in mixed actions jurisdiction is vested in the judge of the place where the property is situated or the residence of the defendant, at the election of the plaintiff. As the mortgaged property is situated in Negros, which is also the place of residence of all the defendants, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary in the contract and in the absence of an express or tacit submission to the particular judge, the action should have been brought in Negros. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the plaintiff that the competency of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to try the case has been expressly conferred by a certain clause contained in the contract of debt and mortgage, which reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Payment to be made in current silver to the exclusion of other values in this city (Iloilo) at the house of the creditor, to whose domicile the contracting parties (debtors) expressly submit themselves, renouncing all other domicile.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It is contended that this clause is sufficient to show an express submission by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo under the provisions of articles 40 and 41 of the Spanish Code of Civil Procedure, which read as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"ART. 40. Any judge tacitly or expressly agreed upon by the litigant parties shall have jurisdiction over any action brought before and submitted to him,\" etc. <br/><br/>\"ART. 41. An express submission is made when the litigant parties clearly and in definite terms renounce the right to present the matter before the proper court and unequivocally designate the judge agreed upon to determine the question.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Was the clause in question such an express submission to the jurisdiction of the court of Iloilo as is defined in article 41 of the Spanish Code of Civil Procedure? The clause in question not only made the debt payable in Iloilo but the debtors renounced their own domicile and expressly submitted themselves to the domicile and expressly submitted themselves to the domicile of the plaintiff, at Iloilo. it is evident that the object of the latter part of the clause was not to make the debt payable at such domicile, because the parties had already stipulated in express terms that this should be the case. In order to give every part of the clause effect this part must be construed to mean that the parties intended to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court at Iloilo. <br/><br/>By designation of the judge is meant the designation of the court. Manresa says:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"It is not to be understood from this that it is necessary to designate the judge by name; on the contrary, we believe that this should not be done because it might give rise to doubts and questions. If the parties interested, waiving their own forum, should say that they submit to Mr. So and So, Judge of Alicante, for instance, if So and So should for any reason cease to hold this office, the question would immediately arise as to whether the submission was to be regarded as extended to his successor.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The defendants also contend that by the provisions of article 170, General Regulations for the Execution of the Mortgage Law, the judge of competent jurisdiction must be the judge of the place in which the mortgaged property is situated,  \"no change of venue being admissible.\" A sufficient answer to this objection is, that the mortgage was executed in 1891, while the Mortgage law was enacted in 1893, a date subsequent to the date of the mortgage. Under article 175 of this law creditors who had their right recorded before the law went into effect were given the option to select the summary procedure provided for in the act. But the plaintiff has not availed himself of this option. The suit brought by him is an executive action under Chapter XV of the Civil Code of Procedure, in force at the date of the mortgage. <br/><br/>The judge in dismissing the case based his ruling also on the grounds that the value of the mortgaged property was not shown. <br/><br/>Article 127 of the Mortgage Law requires that there must appear in the mortgage the value of the estate as appraised by the contracting parties; but for the same reason as before stated, the plaintiff has not elected to pursue the summary action, this provision must be held not to apply; and even in the summary action, where the creditor whose debt was contracted before the date of the Mortgage Law has elected to enforce his claim under the summary action, an appraisement may be made in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. (General Regulations Execution Mortgage Law, article 175.) <br/><br/>An appraisement in the executive action under the Code of Civil Procedure is made after the order directing the sale of the property. This stage in the proceedings had not been reached when the case was dismissed. <br/><br/>There are other questions presented in the record not passed upon by the Court of First Instance and unnecessary for us to consider in the decision of the case. <br/><br/>For the error committed in dismissing the case the judgment of the Court of First Instance is reversed, and it is ordered that the case be reinstated and its status as it existed at the date of the rendition of the judgment of dismissal be restored, and costs of this appeal is adjudged against the appellees. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The penalty imposed upon the defendants of 12 years and 1 day is, however, not in conformity with law. The offense falls within article 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code. The maximum penalty allowed by that article is ten years. The aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence ought not to be considered.

This indicates an abuse of confidence no more than would an invitation by them that he should accompany them to a retired place where they could rob him without interference. <br/><br/>No aggravating nor attenuating circumstances appearing, the penalty should be imposed in the medium grade, and we fix it at three years eight months and one day of presidio correccional, with indemnification of 27 pesos, Mexican, restitution of the value of the two undershirts as may be fixed by experts if said underwear is not returned, and in case of insolvency defendant is sentenced to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment and to the payment of costs of both instances.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The object of this action is to obtain from the court a declaration that a partnership exists between the parties, that the plaintiff has a consequent interest in certain cascoes which are alleged to be partnership property, and that the defendant is bound to render an account of his administration of the cascoes and the business carried on with them. <br/><br/>Judgment was rendered for the defendant in the court below and the plaintiff appealed. <br/><br/>The respective claims of the parties as to the facts, so far as it is necessary to state them in order to indicate the point in dispute, may be briefly summarized. The plaintiff alleges that in January, 1900, he entered into a verbal agreement with the defendant to form a partnership for the purchase of cascoes and the carrying on of the business of letting the same for hire in Manila, the defendant to buy the cascoes and each partner to furnish for that purpose such amount of money as he could, the profits to be divided proportionately; that in the same January the plaintiff furnished the defendant 300 pesos to purchase a casco designated as No. 1515, which the defendant did purchase for 500 pesos of Doña Isabel Vales, taking the title in his own name; that the plaintiff furnished further sums aggregating about 300 pesos for repairs on this casco; that on the fifth of the following March he furnished the defendant 825 pesos to purchase another casco designated as No. 2089, which the defendant did purchase for 1,000 pesos of Luis R. Yangco, taking the title to this casco also in his own name; that in April the parties undertook to draw up articles of partnership for the purpose of embodying the same in an authentic document, but that the defendant having proposed a draft of such articles which differed materially from the terms of the earlier verbal agreement, and being unwilling to include casco No. 2089 in the partnership, they were unable to come to any understanding and no written agreement was executed; that the defendant having in the meantime had the control and management of the two cascoes, the plaintiff made a demand for an accounting upon him, which the defendant refused to render, denying the existence of the partnership altogether. <br/><br/>The defendant admits that the project of forming a partnership in the casco business in which he was already engaged to some extent individually was discussed between himself and the plaintiff in January, 1900, and earlier, one Marcos Angulo, who was a partner of the plaintiff in a bakery business, being also a party to the negotiations, but he denies that any agreement was ever consummated. He denies that the plaintiff furnished any money in January, 1900, for the purchase of casco No. 1515, or for repairs on the same, but claims that he borrowed 300 pesos on his individual account in January from the bakery firm, consisting of the plaintiff, Marcos Angulo, and Antonio Angulo. The 825 pesos, which he admits he received from the plaintiff March 5, he claims was for the purchase of casco No. 1515, which he alleged was bought March 12, and he alleges that he never received anything from the defendant toward the purchase of casco No. 2089. He claims to have paid, exclusive of repairs, 1,200 pesos for the first casco and 2,000 pesos for the second one. <br/><br/>The case comes to this court under the old procedure, and it is therefore necessary for us the review the evidence and pass upon the facts. Our general conclusions may be stated as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tDoña Isabel Vales, from whom the defendant bought casco No. 1515, testifies that the sale was made and the casco delivered in January, although the public document of sale was not executed till some time afterwards. This witness is apparently disinterested, and we think it is safe to rely upon the truth of her testimony, especially as the defendant, while asserting that the sale was in March, admits that he had the casco taken to the ways of repairs in January. <br/><br/>It is true that the public document of sale was executed March 10, and that the vendor declares therein that she is the owner of the casco, but such declaration does not exclude proof as to the actual date of the sale, at least as against the plaintiff, who was not a party to the instrument. (Civil Code, sec. 1218.) It often happens, of course, in such cases, that the actual sale precedes by a considerable time the execution of the formal instrument of transfer, and this is what we think occurred here. <br/><br/>(2)\tThe plaintiff presented in evidence the following receipt:  \"I have this day received from D. Jose Fernandez eight hundred and twenty-five pesos for the cost of a casco which we are to purchase in company. Manila, March 5, 1900. Francisco de la Rosa.\" The authenticity of this receipt is admitted by the defendant. If casco No. 1515 was bought, as we think it was, in January, the casco referred to in the receipt which the parties  \"are to purchase in company\" must be casco No. 2089, which was bought March 22. We find this to be the fact, and that the plaintiff furnished and the defendant received 825 pesos toward the purchase of this casco, with the understanding that it was to be purchased on joint account. <br/><br/>(3)\tAntonio Fernandez testifies that in the early part of January, 1900, he saw Antonio Angulo give the defendant, in the name of the plaintiff, a sum of money, the amount of which he is unable to state, for the purchase of a casco to be used in the plaintiff’s and defendant’s business. Antonio Angulo also testified, but the defendant claims that the fact that Angulo was a partner of the plaintiff rendered him incompetent as a witness under the provisions of article 643 of the then Code of Civil Procedure, and without deciding whether this point is well taken, we have discarded his testimony altogether in considering the case. The defendant admits the receipt of 300 pesos from Antonio Angulo in January, claiming, as has been stated, that it was a loan from the firm. Yet he sets up the claim that the 825 pesos which he received from the plaintiff in March were furnished toward the purchase of casco No. 1515, thereby virtually admitting that casco was purchased in company with the plaintiff. We discover nothing in the evidence to support the claim that the 300 pesos received in January was a loan, unless it may be the fact that the defendant had on previous occasions borrowed money from the bakery firm. We think all the probabilities of the case point to the truth of the evidence of Antonio Fernandez as to this transaction, and we find the fact to be that the sum in question was furnished by the plaintiff toward the purchase for joint ownership of casco No. 1515, and that the defendant received it with the understanding that it was to be used for this purpose. We also find that the plaintiff furnished some further sums of money for the repair of this casco. <br/><br/>(4)\tThe balance of the purchase price of each of the two cascoes over and above the amount contributed by the plaintiff was furnished by the defendant. <br/><br/>(5)\tWe are unable to find upon the evidence before us that there was any specific verbal agreement of partnership, except such as may be implied from the facts as to the purchase of the casco. <br/><br/>(6)\tAlthough the evidence is somewhat unsatisfactory upon this point, we think it more probable than otherwise that no attempt was made to agree upon articles of partnership till about the middle of the April following the purchase of the cascoes. <br/><br/>(7)\tAt some time subsequently to the failure of the attempt to agree upon partnership articles and after the defendant had been operating the cascoes for some time, the defendant returned to the plaintiff, 1,125 pesos, in two different sums, one of 300 and one of 825 pesos. The only evidence in the record as to the circumstances under which the plaintiff received these sums is contained in his answers to the interrogatories proposed to him by the defendant, and the whole of his statement on this point may properly be considered in determining the facts as being in the nature of an indivisible admission. He states that both sums were received with an express reservation on his part of all his rights as a partner. We find this to be the fact. <br/><br/>Two questions of law are raised by the foregoing facts:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1) Did a partnership exist between the parties? (2) If such partnership existed, was it terminated as a result of the act of the defendant in receiving back the 1,125 pesos?<br/><br/>(1)  \"Partnership is a contract by which two or more persons bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves.\" (Civil Code, art. 1665.) <br/><br/>The essential points upon which the minds of the parties must meet in a contract of partnership are, therefore, (1) mutual contribution to a common stock, and (2) a joint interest in the profits. If the contract contains these two elements the partnership relation results, and the law itself fixes the incidents of this relation if the parties fail to do so. (Civil Code, secs. 1689, 1695.) <br/><br/>We have found as a fact that money was furnished by the plaintiff and received by the defendant with the understanding that it was to be used for the purchase of the cascoes in question. This establishes the first element of the contract, namely, mutual contribution to a common stock. The second element, namely, the intention to share profits, appears to be an unavoidable deduction from the fact of the purchase of the cascoes in common, in the absence of any other explanation of the object of the parties in making the purchase in that form, and, it may be added, in view of the admitted fact that prior to the purchase of the first casco the formation of a partnership had been a subject of negotiation between them. <br/><br/>Under other circumstances the relation of joint ownership, a relation distinct though perhaps not essentially different in its practical consequence from that of partnership, might have been the result of the joint purchase. If, for instance, it were shown that the object of the parties in purchasing in company had been to make a more favorable bargain for the two cascoes than they could have done by purchasing them separately, and that they had no ulterior object except to effect a division of the common property when once they had acquired it, the affectio societatis would be lacking and the parties would have become joint tenants only; but, as nothing of this sort appears in the case, we must assume that the object of the purchase was active use and profit and not mere passive ownership in common. <br/><br/>It is thus apparent that a complete and perfect contract of partnership was entered into by the parties. This contract, it is true, might have been subject to a suspensive condition, postponing its operation until an agreement was reached as to the respective participation of the partners in the profits, the character of the partnership as collective or en comandita, and other details, but although it is asserted by counsel for the defendant that such was the case, there is little or nothing in the record to support this claim, and the fact that the defendant did actually go on and purchase the boats, as it would seem, before any attempt had been made to formulate partnership articles, strongly discountenances the theory. <br/><br/>The execution of a written agreement was not necessary in order to give efficacy to the verbal contract of partnership as a civil contract, the contributions of the partners not having been in the form of immovables or rights in immovables. (Civil Code, art. 1667.) The special provision cited, requiring the execution of a public writing in the single case mentioned and dispensing with all formal requirements in other cases, renders inapplicable to this species of contract the general provisions of article 1280 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>(2)\tThe remaining question is as to the legal effect of the acceptance by the plaintiff of the money returned to him by the defendant after the definitive failure of the attempt to agree upon partnership articles. The amount returned fell short, in our view of the facts, of that which the plaintiff had contributed to the capital of the partnership, since it did not include the sum which he had furnished for the repairs of casco No. 1515. Moreover, it is quite possible, as claimed by the plaintiff, that a profit may have been realized from the business during the period in which the defendant had been administering it prior to the return of the money, and if so he still retained that sum in his hands. For these reasons the acceptance of the money by the plaintiff did not have the effect of terminating the legal existence of the partnership by converting it into a societas leonina, as claimed by counsel for the defendant. <br/><br/>Did the defendant waive his right to such interest as remained to him in the partnership property by receiving the money? Did he by so doing waive his right to an accounting of the profits already realized, if any, and a participation in them in proportion to the amount he had originally contributed to the common fund? Was the partnership dissolved by the  \"will or withdrawal of one of the partners\" under article 1705 of the Civil Code?  We think these questions must be answered in the negative. <br/><br/>There was no intention on the part of the plaintiff in accepting the money to relinguish his rights as a partner, nor is there any evidence that by anything that he said or by anything that he omitted to say he gave the defendant any ground whatever to believe that he intended to relinquish them. On the contrary he notified the defendant that he waived none of his rights in the partnership. Nor was the acceptance of the money an act which was in itself inconsistent with the continuance of the partnership relation, as would have been the case had the plaintiff withdrawn his entire interest in the partnership. There is, therefore, nothing upon which a waiver, either express or implied, can be predicated. The defendant might have himself terminated the partnership relation at any time, if he had chosen to do so, by recognizing the plaintiff’s right in the partnership property and in the profits. Having failed to do this he can not be permitted to force a dissolution upon his copartner upon terms which the latter is unwilling to accept. We see nothing in the case which can give the transaction in question any other aspect than that of the withdrawal by one partner with the consent of the other of a portion of the common capital. <br/><br/>The result is that we hold and declare that a partnership was formed between the parties in January, 1900, the existence of which the defendant is bound to recognize; that cascoes Nos. 1515 and 2089 constitute partnership property, and that the plaintiff is entitled to an accounting of the defendant’s administration of such property, and of the profits derived therefrom. This declaration does not involve an adjudication as to any disputed items of the partnership account. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below will be reversed without costs, and the record returned for the execution of the judgment now rendered. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, dissenting. <br/><br/>ON MOTION FOR A REHEARING. <br/><br/>MAPA, <em>J. </em>:</div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 15th of June, 1900, Maria Mina, a citizen of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, filed a complaint against Ponciano Viloria for the redemption of a piece of land sold by her to the latter for $120, subject to the right of redemption, alleging that the purchaser had refused to reconvey the same. The defendant declined to answer the complaint on the ground that the justice of the peace of Narvacan was without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the value of the property sold was $220 as shown by a private document exhibited at that time. This document, which appears in the record on page 88, was impugned by the private prosecutor as a forgery, and she asked that a prosecution be instituted for this crime. This petition was reproduced in a formal complaint dated on the 14th of August, 1900 (record, p. 1), in which she alleges that the accused presented the said false document animus lucrandi, and to the damage of the complainant. That she had not drawn, authorized, or signed the said document, inasmuch as she was absent from Narvacan at the date thereof, and that it was not true that she had agreed to limit the time within which to redeem the property, nor that she had received an increase of $100 over the $120, which was the consideration for the land covered by the original document (record, p. 87), and denied that in consideration of the increased price she had sold upon similar terms another piece of adjacent land lying to the east of the first tract, alleging that she was still in possession of the latter property and citing several witnesses to that effect. <br/><br/>Upon this complaint and in view of the result of the preliminary investigation conducted at the instance of the complainant, the judge directed that the defendant be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of a private document. The accused appeared for arraignment and plead not guilty. In this subsequent testimony he stated (record, p. 128) that about five years ago Maria Mina had mortgaged to him a piece of land belonging to her situated at a place called Tamdagan, at the town of Narvacan, for the sum of $120; that on the 8th of June, 1898, at the request of Maria Mina, who needed money to pay an indebtedness to one Bonifacio Azada, and in accordance with their agreement, the witness advanced her another $100 in consideration of another small piece of land adjacent to the land covered by the mortgage, which it was agreed was to be converted into a sale, with the reservation to the vendor of the right to redeem within one year; that in accordance with this agreement he directed Juan Martinez and Severino Cabaya, since deceased, on the afternoon of June 8, 1898, to go to the house of the complaining witness and pay her the said sum of $100, and that the woman, Mina, herself made the final copy of the contract from the draft drawn, writing it at the foot of the old document, which, together with the draft of the agreement, had been taken to her by the bearers of the money; that the latter upon their return to the house after nightfall brought with them the said writing (original record, p. 88; translation record, p. 211); that Basilia Ballejos, Bonifacio Azada, and the two messengers were eyewitnesses to the writing of the document by Maria Mina. The witness added that when the justice of the peace of Narvacan appointed Don Gregorio Navarro receiver to take possession of the two pieces of land as the result of the civil action brought by Maria Mina that the witness was in possession of the land, and that when the receiver was discharged the land was returned to him. <br/><br/>He who to the damage of another or with the intention to cause damage commits any one of the foregeries or falsifications designated in article 300 of the Penal Code in a private document, is subject to the penalty prescribed by article 304 thereof. <br/><br/>The complaining witness charged the accused with having counterfeited, simulated, or feigned in the document on page 88 of the record her handwriting, signature, and scroll, and of having been guilty of falsehood by having expressed in this document contracts and stipulations which were not agreed upon between them, this with the intention of causing her damage as shown by the fact of his having introduced it in evidence in the civil case as a defense to her action. <br/><br/>The complaining witness, Mina, having denied the authenticity of the document and of the signature and scroll, which it purports to bear, alleging that they are not her signature or scroll, and that she did not write the same, the burden of proof is on the accused who affirms the authenticity of the document and the veracity of its contents to show these facts, and her denial is sufficient for the document to be regarded as false unless these facts are properly proven. <br/><br/>However, notwithstanding the denial of Maria Mina and her allegation of the falsity of this document, and notwithstanding the testimony of the witnesses presented by her at the trial for the purpose of proving that she was absent from Narvacan and was in Vigan on the date in which the document purports to have been written and signed, and therefore that she could not have written it, and that the land said to have been sold by this document to Viloria with the right of redemption had not been delivered to the latter but was still in her possession, and was under cultivation by Cornelio Cardona at her account, the record shows sufficient evidence to the contrary to prove that the sale actually took place, and that the document attacked as false is authentic. <br/><br/>Upon an examination of the evidence introduced by the accused it appears that four witnesses were present when the complainant wrote and signed the document on the afternoon of June 8, 1898. Only three of them testified to this fact, the fourth witness having died after the occurrence and prior to the trial, although it appears from the record of the preliminary investigation in the case and which was sent up with the trial record that this witness also testified in the same way. It can not therefore be believed that the complaining witness was absent on that afternoon from the town of Narvacan or that she was in Vigan, as testified to by four witnesses. This view is further supported by the fact that two of these witnesses testified only to statements made by one of the other two. The fifth witness, Anatalio Pichay, in whose house the complaining witness, Mina, alleges that she stopped while in Vigan does not remember the date or the year in which this occurred. <br/><br/>Three witnesses, residents of the neighborhood, and owners of property adjacent to the land referred to in the deed, testified that the accused is the owner of the said land which was formerly and property of the complaining witness, Mina, and that Juan Martinez and Bibiana de la Cuadra have been successively cultivating it for the account of the accused since 1898. This is corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses who, however, state that the land was being cultivated in the name of Bonifacio Azada, to whom the accused conveyed the second piece of land. this statement was also made by the accused in his testimony. It is worthy of note that when the land was put in the hands of a receiver at the instance of Maria Mina on account of the civil action referred to, the receiver, Gregorio Navarro, who took charge of the land, upon being examined as a witness for the prosecution stated that he did not remember who possessed the lands of which he had been receiver, nor did he remember to whom they were returned at the expiration of the receivership. <br/><br/>Upon this examination of the merits of the case and of the evidence introduced, and in view of the result of the examination by experts of the handwriting, signature, and scroll of the complaining witness, the exercise of a sound discretion leads to a complete conviction that the contract expressed in the document referred to was actually entered into; that the document is authentic; that Ponciano Viloria purchased the said lands which were not possessed by or under the control, even of the complaining witness, who, for the purpose of recovering them, was obliged to invoke the aid of the courts, and therefore Viloria is not guilty of the crime of which he is charged. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds justice requires that the appealed judgment should be reversed and the accused Ponciano viloria acquitted for lack of evidence of the crime of which he is charged, with the costs of both instances de oficio. The court below is directed to make the necessary orders with respect to the property of the accused, which has been attached.

The conviction can not be sustained for two reasons: (1) The complaint does not charge that offense. There is no allegation that the defendant had not given information as to the whereabouts of Nicasio Rafael. (2) There was not sufficient evidence that the whereabouts of said Nicasio Rafael was not known. He was not a resident of the town in which he was seized, but was casually passing through there. It was proved that he had a wife living in Tondo. The only evidence that he had disappeared was the testimony of the three persons who were in the house when he was taken away, who said that they had not seen him since. The mere failure of the defendant to give notice of the whereabouts of the man seized is not sufficient to convict him. In addition to that fact the court must be satisfied that the man has really disappeared. The best evidence of this fact would be the testimony of the members of his family. <br/><br/>The complaint is, however, with slight amendments, sufficient to charge the defendant with the illegal detention of Zacarias Tiongson. The judgment is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to amend the complaint by striking out all reference to Nicasio Rafael, and inserting statements as to the time and place, where and when the crime was committed, to call upon the defendant to plead to the amended complaint, and to try him thereon without prejudice to the right of the fiscal to proceed against the defendant in a separate complaint for the illegal detention of Nicasio Rafael under said article 483. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The subject of this action is the will executed by Doña Juana Espinosa, widow of Don Pedro Hernaez, on December 5, 1894, in Bacolod, Island of Negros, before a notary public, and three witnesses, and with the aid of an interpreter, the testatrix not understanding Spanish. In this will the principal dispositions are those relative to the legacy of the third part of the hereditary estate of free disposal, which the testatrix leaves to her eldest son, Rosendo, to the betterment of the other third made in favor of this same son, and the distribution of the remaining third in six equal parts among her five children, Rosendo, Domingo, Magdalena, Mateo, and Eulalio Hernaez y Espinosa, and her two granddaughters, Peregrina and Victorina Parapa y Hernaez, in representation of their deceased mother, Clara Hernaez y Espinosa. <br/><br/>The plaintiff is one of the sons of the testatrix and the complaint has not been acquiesced in by Magdalena Hernaez y Espinosa nor Peregrina and Victorina Parapa y Hernaez, whose consent plaintiff sought to obtain. <br/><br/>The action brought is for the annulment of the will upon the ground: (1) of the incapacity of the testatrix; (2) the incapacity of the notary, attesting witnesses, and the interpreter; and (3) a substantial formal defect in the will. <br/><br/>The incapacity of the testatrix according to the complaint is alleged to consist in this: That on the 5th of December, 1894, she was over 80 years of age and was so ill that three days before she had received the sacraments and extreme unction, and that two days afterwards she died; and that prior thereto she walked in a stooping attitude, and gave contraditory orders, as a result of her senile debility. The incapacity of the notary in that he did not understand the Visayan dialect, the language of the testatrix. The incapacity of the attesting witnesses is supposed to consist in their not having a perfect knowledge of Spanish, and the incapacity of the interpreter in that he was an amanuensis of the notary and was the person who wrote out the will. The substantial formal defect of the will is supposed to consist in the fact that two physicians were not present to certify to the sanity of the testatrix at the time of its execution, and the absence of two interpreters to translate the will, because executed in a foreign language. <br/><br/>These are briefly, the grounds upon which the action for the annulment of the will rests, and these were the issues raised at the trial. The evidence introduced bears upon the issues above stated to which alone the decision of the court must be limited. <br/><br/>For the purpose of proving the mental incapacity of the testatrix the plaintiff introduced oral testimony and expert evidence; the oral testimony was for the purpose of proving the following facts: That the testatrix on the 5th day of December, 1894, was so ill that she could not speak; that by reason of her age she walked in a stooping position and gave contradictory orders. The priest who was with her during the last hours of her life was called to testify that on the 3d day of the same month and year he had administered the sacraments to her, and that the patient was at that time so seriously ill that he scarcely understood her when she spoke. The expert witnesses were called to testify upon the question propounded:  \"Could an octogenarian in the pathological condition peculiar to that age possess sufficient mental faculties to permit her to dispose of her property causa mortis?\" The result of the oral evidence is that the testimony of the four witnesses called has proven one fact, which is, that the testatrix toward the end of her life walked in a stooping position. The first witness, Isidora de la Torres, affirmed that three days before her death she was very ill but answered questions which were addressed her, and only one witness, Ambrosia Sotsing, testified that four days before the death of the testatrix she had been to see the latter and that she could not speak then because she was suffering from fainting fits, this witness being the only one who testified that the testatrix had given contrary orders. These four witnesses are, respectively, 78, 75, 60, and 57 years of age. The priest, D. Nicolas Alba, stated that he had administered the sacraments to the testatrix before the execution of the will but was unable to remember the day; that he understood her then when she spoke and that the testatrix frequently confessed even when not feeling seriously ill, and that when sick she was accustomed to confess in her house (this point is confirmed by the witness Sotsing who testified that she had been to see the testatrix three times and that on all three of these occasions the communion had been administered to her); that when he confessed her some days before the execution of the will he had also administered the extreme unction on account of her advanced age; that at that time she was in the enjoyment of her mental faculties but the witness could not state whether she preserved them up to the moment of her death, he not being present when this occurred. The expert evidence introduced by the testimony of Dr. Lope de la Rama gave the following result: That if the organs are intact the physiological functions are perfectly performed, and that consequently some men before reaching the age of decrepitude lose their mental faculties by the weakening of the brain, either as the result of illness or of abuses, while others preserve their understanding to a very advanced age. It is unnecessary to pass upon the oral evidence introduced by the defendant; the documentary evidence (record, p. 38) shows that the testatrix did not die two days after the execution of her will. The will was executed on the 5th and her death occurred on the 12th of December, 1894. <br/><br/>It is sufficient to state that neither from the facts elicited by the interrogatories nor the documents presented with the complaint can the conclusion be reached that the testatrix was deprived of her mental faculties. The fact that an old woman gives contradictory orders, that she walks in a stooping position, that she has fainting fits, that she received the sacraments some days before making her will, are circumstances which even if fully demonstrated by proof could not lead the court to establish a conclusion contrary to the mental soundness of a person who is to be presumed to be in the full enjoyment of the mental faculties until the contrary is conclusively proven. The notary in compliance with the requirements of article 695 of the Civil Code certifies that in his judgment the testatrix had the necessary legal capacity and the use of the necessary mental faculties for the purposes of the execution of the will.  \"The Code might have adopted either one of two systems [with respect to the mental capacity of the testator] — that of establishing as a general rule the presumption of soundness of the mental faculties until the contrary be proven, or that of presuming mental weakness in the absence of proof that the act was performed while the mental faculties were in their normal condition. Under the first presumption a will made should be declared valid in all cases, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Under the second it would have to be considered as void upon the presumption that it was executed by a person demented, unless the contrary is shown. The Code has adopted the first system as being the most rational, by accepting the principle that mental soundness is always to be presumed with respect to a person who has not been previously incapacitated until the contrary is demonstrated and proven by the proper person and the correctness of this choice is beyond doubt; in the meantime the intervention of the notary and the witnesses constitutes a true guaranty of the capacity of the testator, by reason of their knowledge of the matter. (Manresa, Commentaries, vol. 5, p. 344.) <br/><br/>It has at no time been regarded as a ground for the annulment of a public instrument executed before a notary public by a native of these Islands, ignorant of Spanish, that the notary was not acquainted with the dialect of the party executing the same. If this officer, upon whom the law imposes the obligation of drawing the instrument in the official language, that is, Castilian, does not know the dialect he can avail himself of an interpreter in accordance with the provisions of the law itself; hence the fact that the notary who legalized the will in question did not know the Visayan dialect spoken by the testatrix is by no means an argument in favor of the nullity of this public instrument, nor has it been for the nullity of any one of the long series of instruments executed before Spanish notaries, and even Filipino notaries, unacquainted with the dialect or dialects of the locality in which they performed their duties or the special dialect of the party. With respect to the attesting witnesses it has been fully proven by the manner in which they testified at the trial,  \"without the necessity of an interpreter,\" as to those called as witnesses and by conclusive evidence as to the deceased attesting witness whose signature and competency have been completely established, that they knew the dialect of the testatrix in accordance with section 5, article 681, of the Civil Code, and also understood Spanish. As alleged, but not proven, their knowledge of the latter language may not have been perfect, but this does not make them incompetent, nor is it a ground for annulment. Finally, the prohibition of article 681, section 8, is not applicable to the interpreter, of whose services the notary availed himself for the execution, drafting, and legalization of the will, for the simple reason that it does not refer to the interpreter but the witnesses, and there is nothing to authorize the extensive interpretation attempted to be made of its precepts. <br/><br/>The presence of two physicians, as required in the case covered by article 665, was not necessary.  \"This precept refers clearly and expressly to the conditions which must be complied with in order that a demented person may make a will by availing himself of a lucid interval, and is entirely distinct from the cases governed by article 685 when the testator has not been declared demented.\" (Judgment of June 10, 1897.) <br/><br/>Had anyone observed any incapacity in the testatrix some time before it would have been easy to have taken the proper steps to obtain a declaration of this status of incapacity in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, and then, after a legal declaration of this condition, she could not have executed a will unless two physicians had certified that at the time of her examination she was in the enjoyment of a lucid interval; but there was no necessity of waiting for a lucid interval when the constant condition was that of lucidity. <br/><br/>Nor was it necessary that two interpreters be present as required by article 684 of the Civil Code. This is a requisite for the execution of a will in a foreign language, and neither by the letter nor by the purpose of this article could it be required with regard to the will in question. Not by the letter, because neither the testatrix nor the notary expressed themselves in a foreign language. Neither the Castilian spoken by the notary nor the Visayan spoken by the testatrix are foreign languages. Nor is the case within the purpose of the law.  \"The prior laws had not provided for the execution of a will by a foreigner in his own language. Such a case could not arise under the old law because the right to make a will being one inherent in citizenship they systematically denied to the foreigner the exercise of that right. The execution of a will being at the present time based upon natural right, the foreigner is entitled equally with the citizen to make a will. Although it is true that foreigners, under international law, can make a will before the consuls of their nation, it is none the less true that they do not always make their wills in a town in which an accredited consul resides. For all these reasons it was necessary to provide by law for a special form for the will of the foreigner who might be ignorant of the Spanish language and yet have occasion to make a will. The form which the law has adopted satisfies the most exigent spirit, for the presence of two interpreters, the fact that the will is recorded in a public instrument in both languages, and that it is signed by all who take part in the act are the most efficacious guarantees against fraud and bad faith.\" (Falcon, 3 Civil Code, p. 94.) Text writers discuss the application of article 684 to a will executed in one of the local idioms of Spain, considering them to be on the same footing as a foreign language in a place in which Castilian is the tongue spoken or understood; but we have no occasion to enter into this discussion, the legal sense and constant practice observed in these Islands being sufficient. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds we hold that judgment must be for the defendant, declaring the will executed by Doña Juana Espinosa on the 5th of December, 1894, to be valid and efficacious, without special imposition of costs. <br/><br/>So ordered. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, disqualified. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 14th of January, 1902, counsel for the bank (Spanish-Philippine Bank) filed a complaint charging Don Secundino Mendezona with the crime of estafa upon the ground that he, as manager of the firm of Mendezona &amp; Co., on the 5th day of January, 1900, received from said Spanish-Philippine Bank the sum of $300,000, offering as security among other property the building known as the procuration house of the Franciscan Friars, this offer being contained in a letter addressed to the management of the bank; that on the 19th of February following, of the same year, Mendezona by another letter asked and obtained a further credit of $300,000 as an extension of the former credit, offering as security the same property; that demand having been made upon the accused for the execution of the corresponding mortgage deed which he had verbally undertaken to execute, he stated that the notary public, Mr. Barrera, had the title deeds or papers of the property, and thus fraudulently succeeded in putting off the execution of the mortgage deed up to the 6th day of August, 1902, on which date Mendezona as such manager sold the said procuration building for the sum of $400,000, subject to the right of redemption, to Messrs. Juan Martinez Ybañez, Manuel Ybeas, Felipe Garcia, and Jorge Romanillos, the vendor having declared in the deed of sale that the property was free from all charges and incumbrances, these acts having been committed against the form of the statute made and provided and to the damage of the bank in the sum of at least $150,000. <br/><br/>The complainant was admitted and the Court of First Instance conducted the corresponding preliminary investigation. The proof taken discloses that on the 22d of November, 1899, a verbal contract of sale was entered into between the representatives of the Franciscan Friars and Don Secundino Mendezona, manager of the firm of Mendezona &amp; Co., concerning the said city property situated on Isla de Romero Street and known as the procuration building. The consideration was $190,000, which sum, as a result of a subsequent agreement, was to be left on deposit with the firm of Mendezona &amp; Co., drawing interest at 8 per cent per annum, the purchaser being authorized to take immediate possession of the property and to make such alterations therein as he might deem necessary. This verbal contract appears to have been confirmed by letter. (Record, p. 12.) <br/><br/>It also appears from the record of the preliminary investigation that towards the end of November, 1899, Don Secundino Mendezona took possession of the property sold, and commenced the work of making alterations in the same, and that on the 21st of July, 1900, the corresponding deed of conveyance of the said property was drawn. <br/><br/>It also appears that this procuration building stands on the books of Mendezona &amp; Co. as an asset valued at $250,000, and that the books show as a liability a debit of $190,000 in favor of the Franciscan Friars on the 1st of January, 1900. <br/><br/>It also appears that several demands were made on the accused Mendezona after the month of March of that year for the execution by him of a public deed of mortgage but that this was not done, he simply replying that the papers or title deeds of the property were being prepared for the purpose of delivering them to the notary, Barrera. The contract of sale agreed upon in November, 1899, was not formally executed before Sr. Barrera until the 21st of July, 1900. The notary testifies under oath that the documents connected with the procuration building were delivered to him by the father provincial of the Franciscan Friars on the second or third month before the date of the execution of the deed of sale of the said building, and that the father provincial also delivered to him the draft of the instrument which stipulated that the consideration for the sale of the procuration building to Mendezona &amp; Co. was to remain in the possession of the firm as a deposit. <br/><br/>From the text of the complaint upon which this preliminary investigation was commenced, and which was finally terminated by the appealed order, it is evident that the charge of estafa brought against Mendezona consists in the allegation that he, acting fraudulently and in bad faith, delayed the performance of the offer made by him to the Spanish-Philippine Bank to securing the two sums received by him from the latter as a loan on the 5th of January and the 19th February, 1900, by eluding the execution of the mortgage of the so-called procuration building of the Franciscans up to the 6th of August, 1900, on which day he sold the same to the Augustinian Fathers for the sum of $400,000, having declared in the instrument of conveyance executed to that effect that this property was free from all incumbrance or gravamen. <br/><br/>So that the facts set forth in the complaint and alleged to constitute the crime of estafa are two: (1) That of having failed to perform the promise to give a mortgage on the said procuration building for the purpose of securing the payment of the $600,000 received from the bank, he availing himself of subterfuge and deceitful means to avoid the execution of the mortgage deed, and (2) that of having declared in the deed of sale to the Augustinian Fathers that the said building was free from all incumbrance or gravamen, when as a matter of fact it had been offered in mortgage, and that these facts constituted a violation of the Penal Law. <br/><br/>The complaint uses the generic term of estafa as the classification of the crimes with which the accused is charged but without determining the species of fraud committed, or citing the article of the Penal Code violated, although this was subsequently done in the printed briefs filed by the complainant, asking that articles 535, section 1, and 537, and 541 of the Penal Code be applied. <br/><br/>The first of these two facts charged in the complaint, if proven, would fall within article 541 as constituting an estafa not penalized by the preceding articles which define and punish such crimes. <br/><br/>The second of the facts charged, if proven, would fall under the sanction of section 2 of article 537 of the Code, because in such case the accused would have disposed of the property, selling it as unencumbered, knowing at the time that it was subject to a gravamen. <br/><br/>The mere fact of the nonperformance of the offer or promise to give a mortgage as agreed upon between the contracting parties does not constitute the crime of estafa or any other crime, unless the party bound has acted fraudulently and in bad faith when contracting the principal obligation and when making the promise to give security. Can it be concluded from an examination of the preliminary investigation that when the two contracts of loan of $300,000 each were made between the manager of the bank, Señor Balbas, and the accused Mendezona, that the latter acted deceitfully and with the malicious intent to defraud the bank, and with the intent to break his promise to give the said procuration building, among other property, as security for the performance of the obligation? The result of an examination of the record is a negative answer. <br/><br/>Article 1862 of the Civil Code provides that the promise to mortgage or pledge only produces a personal action between the contracting parties, without prejudice to the criminal liability incurred by him who defrauds another offering in pledge or mortgage, as unencumbered, things which he knew to be encumbered or pretending to be the owners of things which do not belong to him. It is evident, therefore, that the promisor may be compelled by the proper personal action to perform his promise; but the mere breach of the contract or nonperformance of the promise does not result in a violation of the Penal Law. <br/><br/>The article cited provides that criminal liability attaches to the defrauder in the cases expressed, none of which are applicable to the accused because he has not offered things which he knew to be encumbered, nor has he pretended to be the owner of property which did not belong to him. Mendezona had a perfect right to offer this building as security, inasmuch as it was not the property of another nor was it encumbered; and the subsequent disappearance of the promised security by the sale of the property to the Augustinian Friars does not constitute the commission of the crime of estafa because it does not appear that a deceitful intent existed at the time that the loan was made and the security was offered. The obligations contracted were merely personal, subject to all the eventualities which are common to those of its class, and which should be met by prudence and foresight on the part of creditors. <br/><br/>The unusual facility with which the accused Mendezona obtained from the management of the bank two sums of $300,000 on two different occasions at an interval of forty-five days is a circumstance which should be explained not only by the person to whom the money was lent but also by the management of the bank. <br/><br/>In order to form a judgment as to the action of Mendezona with respect to the offer to secure the money borrowed and in order to determine whether he delayed the execution of the mortgage deed fraudulently and in bad faith, it is necessary to hold in view that the deed of sale of the property was only executed by the vendors on the 21st of July, 1900, and it is self-evident that without the deed of sale it would have been impossible to have executed the mortgage or to have had it recorded in the Registry of Property. The record shows that the title deeds to the procuration building sold were in the possession of the Franciscan friars, the former owners, as it was the father superior of the latter who delivered them to the notary, Barrera. This was two or three months prior to the date of the deed of sale, July 21. Hence it is evident that the delay which occurred in the drafting and execution of the deed is not chargeable to the accused. This delay, not imputable to him, can not be made to constitute evidence of fraudulent acts committed by deceit on the part of the accused himself, who, according to his testimony in the record, had not even seen the title deeds to the property sold by him. The delay, if any, was doubtless on the part on the provincial of the Franciscan friars and the notary, Barrera, who took two or three months to draw the deed of sale of the property. The record contains no evidence whatsoever to controvert or overcome this result of the preliminary investigation, and as it does not appear that the Franciscan friars delivered the old title deeds of the building to the purchaser after the verbal sale stipulated in November, 1899, it is to be presumed that Mendezona’s affirmation was true even though it be a fact that demand was made on him for the execution of the deed by the agents of the bank, because in the ordinary course of events the vendor holds the title deeds of the property until the execution of the deed of conveyance, and no evidence to the contrary has been offered in this case to overcome the presumption. <br/><br/>Sixteen days after the execution of the deed of sale of the procuration building to the accused, the latter sold it in turn to the Augustinian friars for $400,000, subject to the right of redemption, and by this operation the accused put it absolutely out of his power to secure the credit of the Spanish-Philippine Bank by a mortgage on the said property. <br/><br/>Was the crime of estafa committed by this proceeding, by selling the property which had been promised as security for the large amount loaned? We think not, because the accused when he offered the property as security for the loan was in possession thereof as owner, and therefore when he contracted the personal obligation he did not act in bad faith nor did he practice deceit. The mere nonperformance of this obligation does not constitute the crime of estafa. The deceit, in cases of fraud, must be antecedent to the obligation in which it originates, and be the cause of the latter and not supervenient thereto. This is the doctrine established by the supreme court of Spain in its judgments of the 7th of January, 14th of March, and 23d of June, 1888, and the 18th of December, 1889, which we think proper to cite in the interpretation and application of the precepts of the Penal Code of Spanish origin. <br/><br/>With reference to the status of the property sold it is unquestionable that it was unencumbered on the 6th of August, 1900, and can not be regarded as having been encumbered or mortgaged merely by its having been offered or promised as security for the money loaned. The promise made by a borrower to give a mortgage upon his property does not result in the attachment of the mortgage offered. <br/><br/>In order that a mortgage may be regarded as existing and productive of legal effects it is indispensable that the formalities prescribed by articles 1857 and 1874 et seq. of the Civil Code, and articles 105 et seq. of the Mortgage Law, applicable to the case, be complied with. <br/><br/>The doctrine established by the Supreme Court of Spain with respect to the interpretation and proper application of article 550 of the Penal Code of Spain, which is the equivalent of article 537 of the Code now in force in these Islands, confirms the doctrine above laid down and is not overruled by any subsequent judgment. The judgment of October 29, 1888, among other things holds that the simple promise to constitute a mortgage does not fall within any of the precepts of article 550 of the Spanish Code — the equivalent of article 537 of the Code of the Philippines — because it is not the same thing to make a promise as to perform the act promised. The decisions of January 7, and March 14, 1888, above cited among other things established the doctrine that for the application of the provisions of the above-cited article of the Penal Code it is necessary that the gravamen imposed on the property be legally constituted by means of the essential formalities prescribed by the law, as otherwise the promise is productive of nothing more than a mere personal obligation. Consequently, unless real property is mortgaged by a public instrument recorded in the Property Register in accordance with the prevailing law the gravamen referred to by article 537 of the Penal Code for the purposes of the application of its precepts can not be considered as existant. (Arts. 1875 and 1880 of the Civil Code.) <br/><br/>These rulings are directly applicable to the facts alleged by counsel for the Spanish-Philippine Bank. In order to bring the case within paragraph 1 of article 537, or paragraph 1 of article 535 of the Penal Code it must appear by the record (1) that Mendezona pretending to be owner of the property without being such owner had offered it as security for the credit of the bank and had subsequently sold it to the Augustinian friars, or (2) that Mendezona defrauded the bank by pretending to be solvent in a higher degree and to own property which he did not have for the purpose of obtaining the loan of the $600,000. <br/><br/>The preliminary investigation does not show that the accused when offering this property to the bank as security and when selling it to the Augustinian friars was not the owner thereof, or that he was without the right to dispose of it. On the contrary, it appears fully therefrom that Mendezona when he offered the procuration house of the Franciscans as security for the money received from the bank, had purchased it more than a month before, was in possession of the premises, and the consideration paid therefor was in the hands of Mendezona &amp; Co. as a deposit, drawing interest at the rate of 8 per cent in favor of the vendor friars; and although the corresponding instrument was not drawn until six months afterwards it is nevertheless true that the accused was in possession of the house as owner by virtue of a perfectly valid verbal contract from which rights and obligations of unquestionable legality doubtless arose, and therefore the accused was in a position to transfer his right of ownership in the property to the Augustinian friars, who, on their part, have not made any complaint whatsoever. (Arts. 1450 and 1451 of the Civil Code and others applicable.) <br/><br/>Nor does it appear from the record of the preliminary investigation that the second of the indicated acts has been committed so as to fall within the provisions of article 535, No. 1, of the Penal Code — that is to say, that Mendezona has defrauded the bank by pretending to be possessed of greater means than he really had at his disposal at the dates of the loans. <br/><br/>Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that in a criminal prosecution the investigation and proof is limited to the facts alleged, that is, to the acts or omissions with which the accused is charged, as he is entitled to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. (Arts. 6 and 15, G. O., 58.) <br/><br/>The two facts falling within the scope of article 535, No. 1, and article 537, No. 1, of the Penal code, and set up by the complainant in its brief are not alleged in the complaint, and although they are designated in the criminal law as constituting the crime of estafa they have not been properly charged, and the complaint has not been amended so as to include them. <br/><br/>In view, therefore, of the negative result of the preliminary investigation we hold that the appealed order must be affirmed inasmuch as it does not appear from the record that the accused has committed the acts charged as constituting the crime of estafa. The ruling of the court below is sustained and in accordance with sections 13 and 14 of General Orders, No. 58, the appealed order is hereby affirmed with the costs of both instances de oficio.

Prautch does not make him the plaintiff. <br/><br/>The court below having allowed Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. as a juridical entity to recover, the defendant objected to the judgment on this ground, and has assigned as error in this court such ruling. <br/><br/>This partnership was engaged in the business of buying and selling cows, woods, bricks, and the products of the country. The proofs show that it never attempted to comply with any of the requirements of the Code of Commerce. if it had complied with that Code it would have been a juridical person. (Article 116.) Assuming, without deciding, that civil partnerships are also juridical persons, did Prautch and Scholes not having complied with the Code of Commerce nevertheless become a civil partnership and thus acquire a personality of its own?<br/><br/>Article 35 of the Civil Code provides that the following are juridical persons:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>1. The corporations, associations, and institutions of public interest recognized by law. <br/><br/>Their personality begins from the very instant in which, in accordance with law, they are validly established. <br/><br/>2. The associations of private interest, be they civil, commercial, or industrial, to which the law may grant proper personality, independent of each member thereof. <br/><br/>Article 36 is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The associations referred to in No. 2 of the foregoing article, shall be governed by the provisions of their articles of associations, according to the nature of the latter.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It becomes necessary to know what partnerships are civil and what ones are mercantile in order to know in a particular case by what provisions of law the partnership there in question is governed. Is a commercial partnership distinguished from a civil one by the object to which it is devoted or by the machinery with which it is organized? We think that the former distinction is the true one. The Code of Commerce of 1829 distinctly provided that those partnerships were mercantile which had for their object an operation of commerce. (Art. 264.) The present Code has not in our opinion made any radical change in this respect. Article 123 provides that mercantile partnerships may be of any class provided that their agreements are lawful and their object industry or commerce. <br/><br/>Article 123 declares that mercantile and industrial partnerships are merchants. It does not say that all partnerships are merchant even if organized under this Code. It is true that article 116 provides that the contract of partnership shall be mercantile whatever may be its class provided it is organized in conformity with the requirements of the Code. Whatever this may mean it can not be construed as indicating that a partnership organized for a purpose not connected at all with industry or commerce shall be a mercantile partnership, thus rendering useless the whole of article 123, and unnecessary the words  \"mercantile and industrial\" in article 123. The present Code does not therefore allow partnerships not included in article 123 to organize under it. That permission is, however, given to them by article 1670 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>This article 1670 is entirely inconsistent with the idea that civil and mercantile partnership are distinguished only by the methods of their organization. (1) Its language is:  \"Civil partnerships, on account of the objects to which they are devoted.\" (2) If article 116 of the Code of Commerce is to be so construed that all partnerships organized in conformity with that Code are mercantile no matter to what ends they are devoted then this article of the Civil Code is unnecessary and useless. If, however, the true distinction is found as we believe in the objects to which the partnerships are devoted, this article can have effect. <br/><br/>The Code of Commerce declares the manner in which commercial partnerships can be organized. Such organization can be effected only in certain well-defined ways. The provisions of this Code were well known when the Civil Code was adopted. The author of that Code when writing article 1667, having in mind the provisions of the Code of Commerce, did not say that a partnership may be organized in any form, which would have repealed the said provisions of the Code of Commerce, but did say instead that a civil partnership may be organized in any form. <br/><br/>If that section includes commercial partnerships then such a partnership can be organized under it selecting from the Code of Commerce such of its provisions as are favorable to the partners and rejecting such as are not, and even including in its articles of agreement the right to do things which by that Code are expressly prohibited. Such a construction would allow a commercial partnership to use or dispense with the Code of Commerce as best suited its own ends. <br/><br/>For example a partnership is organized for commercial purposes. It fails to state its agreements in a public document. The managers are sued by a third person with whom the partnership has contracted, and it is claimed that each of such managers is liable for the whole debt, they having violated article 119 of the Code of Commerce. Their answer is that although they are organized for commercial purposes, they have intentionally omitted to comply with said article 119, and consequently they are a civil partnership, to the managers of which article 120 declaring such liability does not apply. <br/><br/>Another case may be supposed. A partnership is organized for commercial purposes. It fails to comply with the requirements of article 119. A creditor sues the partnership for a debt contracted by it, claiming to hold the partners severally. They answer that their failure to comply with the Code of Commerce makes them a civil partnership and that they are in accordance with article 1698 of the Civil Code only liable jointly. To allow such liberty of action would be to permit the parties by a violation of the Code to escape a liability which the law has seen fit to impose upon persons who organized commercial partnerships;  \"Because it would be contrary to all legal principles that the nonperformance of a duty should redound to the benefit of the person in default either intentional or unintentional.\" (Mercantile Law, Eixala, fourth ed., p. 145.) <br/><br/>Of the commentators writing since the promulgation of the Civil Code Blanco thus defines the difference between a civil and a mercantile partnership:  \"If we can define the contract of partnership in general by saying that it is one by virtue of which several persons bring their property or industry into a common fund for the attainment of a common purpose by common means, then a mercantile partnership will be one in which two or more persons put their property or industry in common or both, applying them to commercial transaction for the purpose of obtaining some profit to be divided among them.\" (2 Blanco, Mercantile Law, 332.) <br/><br/>Estasen says:  \"Companies, in order to be regarded as mercantile, must have for their object the realization of some mercantile act either as a means or an end.\" (7 Mercantile Law, 122.) <br/><br/>Aramburo says:  \"Artificial persons of private interest: We shall have but little to say of these persons, because we have said enough in speaking of the laws by which they are governed. These same laws are those which govern their capacity, and thus civil partnerships will be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code (1) mercantile partnerships by the provisions of the Code of Commerce (20 and industrial partnerships, according to their nature, will be subject to the provisions relative to one or the other of the former classes of partnerships.\" (P. 457.)  \"In effect, we have observed that there are three classes of artificial persons of private interest; that the essential purpose of mercantile partnerships is the earning of a profit; that industrial partnerships may have the characteristics of mercantile or civil partnerships, according to whether they have been established in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Commerce or without regard to the latter; and finally that the civil partnership is the result of the contract of this name entered into by persons who undertake to devote to a common purpose either money, property, or labor with the intention of dividing the profits between themselves.\" (Civil Capacity, 407-432.) <br/><br/>Manresa’s statement that if partnerships are not organized under the Code of Commerce they become civil partnerships clearly refers to industrial partnerships as distinguished from mercantile, and his opinion thus agrees entirely with that of Aramburo above stated. (1 Manresa, Spanish Civil Code, 184.) <br/><br/>It is not necessary in this case to attempt to define an industrial partnership or to distinguish between it and a civil partnership on one hand and a commercial partnership on the other. The partnership of Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. was a typical commercial partnership buying personal property with the purpose of reselling it in the same form at a profit. <br/><br/>Article 1697 of the Italian Civil Code is substantially the same as article 1665 of our Civil Code. Supino in his commentaries on the Commercial Law of Italy, referring to article 1697, says:  \"This definition is in general applicable even to mercantile partnerships which are those which are established with the view to effecting one or more commercial operations. (Art. 76.) It is therefore the purpose which determines the character of a partnership as civil or mercantile. The mercantile form assumed by a partnership whose purposes are of a civil nature is not sufficient to give it the character of a mercantile partnership; it will be governed by the provisions of the Code of Commerce, except with respect to bankruptcy and jurisdiction. (Art. 229.) (Mercantile Law, p. 168).\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We have found no opinion holding the contrary doctrine except a note (p. 44) by the translator of Supino’s work, which is as follows:\" (a) Our Code provides that inscription in the Mercantile Registry is obligatory upon companies and partnerships. (Art. 17.) Upon this inscription and the will of the partners depend the character, civil or mercantile, as the Civil Code does not establish any essential difference (art. 1665) between the two classes, and authorizes civil partnerships (art. 1670) to organize with all the formalities prescribed by the Code of Commerce. (T. N.)\" <br/><br/>The following note also occurs in the work of Don Ramon Marti de Eixala (p. 259):\" (b) Text writers have discussed the question as to whether the division of the social capital into shares is peculiar to commercial associations. This is denied by Toplong (No. 143 of the Commentaries of the Contract of Partnership), who maintains that a company of partnership is to be classified as civil or mercantile according to its object and not according to its mechanism. But other writers support the contrary view.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We hold then on principle and authority that the contract of partnership between Prautch and Scholes was in its nature commercial; that under article 36 of the Civil Code said partnership was governed by the provisions of the Code of Commerce; that its failure to comply with the requirements of that Code did not make it a civil partnership, and thus give it legal personality, which we have assumed such partnerships have. <br/><br/>Having seen that the partnership in question is governed by the Code of Commerce, it remains to ascertain what are the consequences of the failure of the partners to comply with the requirements of the Code. <br/><br/>Article 116 provides that the partnership shall have personality if it is organized in accordance with the Code. This impliedly denies to it personality unless it is so organized. The partners are required to state their agreements in a public writing, and to record them in the Mercantile Registry. (Art. 119, 17.) <br/><br/>Article 24 is as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Articles constituting associations not recorded shall be binding between the members who execute the same but they shall not prejudice third persons, who, however, may make use thereof in so far as advantageous.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>That a commercial partnership which has not recorded its articles of agreement can not maintain an action in its firm name is well settled by the authorities. <br/><br/>\"We see, then, that with respect to both classes of artificial persons (civil and mercantile) certain formalities must be observed in order that their constitution result in legal effects.\" (1 Mucius Scaevola, Com. Civil Code, p. 317.) <br/><br/>\"It is also the fact that a mercantile partnership can not legally exist nor avail itself of the sanction of article 296 of the Code of Commerce (reference is made to the old Code) in enforcing its right against a third person until articles are recorded in the Provincial Registry.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"It has also been declared that although under the provisions of article 284 of the Code of Commerce all contracts of commercial partnerships must be evidenced by public instrument executed with all the legal formalities, and although the failure to comply with this requirement results in the nullity of the contract and makes it unenforceable for the purposes of bringing action under the general provisions of article 236 of the same Code, nevertheless persons who, conjointly and under a firm name or without it, but without being organized with the formalities required, have entered into contracts with third persons they may in their individual capacity bring suit upon actions resulting from such contracts.\" (3 Estasen, Mercantile Law, 36, 37.) <br/><br/>The decisions of the Supreme Court deny legal personality to mercantile partnerships whose articles of agreement are not recorded. (Judgments of May 8, 1885; March 12, 1888; November 23, 1883.) <br/><br/>It would be strange if this principle were not found in the positive law. When several persons unite for a common end and desire to transact their joint business in the name of a new artificial being which they create, they should notify the public who the persons are that are responsible for the acts of this new entity. That notice can be given in no better way than by requiring them to file their articles in the Mercantile Registry, a public record. <br/><br/>The firm of Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. had no legal personality, and this action can not be maintained in its name. <br/><br/>2. No motion for a new trial was made in the court below, and it is therefore said that article 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure prevents us from examining the evidence. <br/><br/>Except in the three cases therein specified this court can not examine or retry questions of fact. But it can examine and decide any question of law that is properly presented by the record. <br/><br/>Whether there is any evidence in the case to support a finding of fact is always a question of law. And whenever it is claimed that there is no evidence to support a particular finding we have a right to examine the record, and if we find no evidence at all upon which as a matter of law such finding could be based it is our duty to so declare and to reverse the judgment for error of law. If, on the contrary, we should find some evidence to support it and a large amount of evidence against it we could not disturb it though we might be convinced that the court below had erred in estimating the weight of the testimony. <br/><br/>In all cases it must appear either expressly by the certificate of the judge or impliedly from the bill of exceptions that it contains all of the evidence in the case having any bearing upon the point of issue. We must have before us all that the judge below had before him when he made the finding in question. If we do not we can not say that there was no evidence to support it. <br/><br/>It sufficiently appears from the bill of exceptions in this case that it contains all of the evidence except the contract between the defendant and Poizart, a letter from Prautch to Poizart, and one from Poizart to Prautch. None of these could have any bearing at all upon this question of personality. <br/><br/>3. We have stated that the plaintiff is Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co., but even on the assumption that the plaintiff is Prautch and not the firm of Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co., the judgment can not be sustained. The court finds that Prautch succeeded to all the rights of the firm. There is no evidence to support this finding. The only testimony on this point is the following by Prautch:  \"Who succeeded to the firm name and signature? I.\" This statement is insufficient as a matter of law to show that Prautch had acquired by assignment the interest of Scholes in this contract of lease. It is entirely consistent with the idea that Scholes still retained his rights in the assets of the extinct partnership. <br/><br/>On the supposition that Prautch might recover the whole of the claim for the benefit of the firm the judgment would have to be reversed, for it allows a recovery in the name of the firm for the sole benefit of Prautch. <br/><br/>4. Of the points made by the plaintiff in its brief, Nos. 1, 2, and 8 refer to the question of personality. The proposition (1) that Prautch and Scholes brought with them from the United States the law there in force relating to partnership and should be governed by it here does not meet with our assent. <br/><br/>The claim (2) that the defendant is stopped from alleging this want of personality because she has dealt with the partnership is not borne out by the record. The only contract which she made with them was the lease. That was signed by them as individuals and not with any firm name. Prautch in his testimony gives this as a reason for not notifying the defendant of the dissolution. <br/><br/>The claim (8) that the decision in this case takes away from Prautch and Scholes rights which they now have can not be sustained. We simply hold that they can not exercise such rights by an action in the name of Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and a new trial granted with costs of the second instance against the appellee.

Teodoro Sandico. One of these carabaos was being ridden by a boy called Abdon Somera and the other by Modesto Palasigui, 9 and 15 years of age, respectively. The robbery occurred at a place called Sacumvaca of the town of Talavera. At the same time eight other carabaos belonging to Don Casimiro Tinio were taken, the total value being $580. The three accused were subsequently arrested on October 17, 1901, at a place called Pinambatan of the town of San Miguel de Mayumo. Part of the stolen carabaos were found in their possession, as well as Abdon Somera, one of the boys kidnaped. The other lad, Palasigui, succeeded in escaping after being in the hands of the robbers for four days. <br/><br/>The crime of kidnapping is being prosecuted in a separate case. <br/><br/>The fact that seven of the armed robbers seized these ten carabaos on two of which the boy Somera and the ladd Palasigue were riding and who were carried by the defendants is fully shown in this case by the testimony of Modesto Palasigui, an eyewitness of the robbery; by the testimony of Rosalio Somera, the father of the boy Abdon, who, upon arriving at the place where the boys had been, noted their disappearance and was unable to find them; and also by the testimony of the three policemen who captured the accused, and found in their possession some of the stolen carabaos, as to the possession of which the accused were unable to give a satisfactory account. The policemen also found the boy Abdon Somera in their hands. <br/><br/>This fact constitutes the crime of robbery in a band, punishable under article 502, 503, paragraph 5, and 504 of the Penal Code, the robbery having been committed by intimidation by the seven robbers, the majority of whom — if not all — were armed with guns and bolos and the robbery being committed in an uninhabited place. <br/><br/>The guilt of the accused is evident notwithstanding their plea of not guilty of the offense with which they are charged. This is shown by the testimony of witnesses, and by the conclusive circumstantial evidence found in the record. This evidence indicates that the seven men who committed this robbery were brigands engaged in assaulting and robbing travelers and stealing carabaos from the fields. The fact that the record does not show that any force or threats were used with respect to the two boys who were riding the two carabaos makes no difference, the fact that seven men armed with firearms and bolos seized these two boys and took the carabaos and carried them off being sufficient to raise the presumption that this was against the will of these boys and that the intimidation which characterized the robbery was present, it not appearing that the boys voluntarily accompanied the robbers or that they voluntarily delivered to them the carabaos. <br/><br/>In the commission of this crime of robbery no generic mitigating or aggravating circumstances are present, the circumstances of the robbery having been committed by a gang and in an uninhabited place being inherent in the specific offense. They are therefore subject to the penalty prescribed by section 5 of article 503 in the medium period of the maximum grade in accordance with the provisions of article 504 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below must therefore be reversed as to the personal penalty imposed upon the accused. Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso are condemned to suffer the penalty of eight years of presidio mayor with the accessory penalties of absolute temporal inhabilitation in its full extent and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for a period equal to the duration of the principal penalty, the same to be counted from the time of the expiration of the latter, and to the payment by each one of one-third part of the costs of both instances. The judgment of the court below is otherwise affirmed with the other third part of the costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This action was brought in connection with the proceedings on the administration of the interstate estate of Pedro Hernaez, father of the plaintiff and of the defendant. The purpose of the action is to obtain the inclusion in the estate by collation of the values of the Naga and Panaogao properties, owned by the defendant, that the same may be included in the inventory of the mass of the intestate succession. The facts set up in the complaint are the following: (1) That as Rosendo Hernaez was a poor man after his return from his student life in Manila, he was supported by his father. (2) That shortly afterwards he purchased the Naga estate, he at that time not being engaged in any profitable trade or industry. (3) That he was the administrator of the property of his parents. (4) That the money with which he purchased the Naga estate belonged to his father. (5) That the Panaogao estate was purchased by Rosendo after the death of his father. <br/><br/>The legal principle upon which the plaintiff relies is that established by article 1035 of the Civil Code, in accordance with which a forced heir in certain cases is required to bring into the mass of the succession properties or moneys which he may have received gratuitously from the decedent during the lifetime of the latter. Therefore it is evident that of the facts set up in the complaint the only one relevant to the issue is the fourth, concerning the acquisition of the Naga estate. With respect to the fifth, as to the Panaogao estate, apart from the fact of its irrelevancy, it is not apparent what connection the simple statement that a forced heir acquired the said estate after the death of the causante can possibly have with the question of collation. <br/><br/>But, whatever might be said about the facts alleged, none of them have been proven. In the replication an allegation was added to the effect that Rosendo Hernaez was never in partnership with Julian Hernaez, his brother, this fact having been set up in the answer of the defendant. <br/><br/>Two witnesses, Miguel Solis and Severino Duran, testified that they had never seen any articles of copartnership recorded in a public or private instrument. Rosendo, however, in answering interrogatories, testified that he had been an industrial partner and that no written articles had been executed. Of the nine witnesses presented by the defendant, Domingo and Magdalena Hernaez and Peregrina Jarapa, the latter a nephew and the former brothers of both the contending parties, denied that Rosendo purchased the Naga estate with money belonging to his father, but testified that it was purchased with money acquired by his own labors. <br/><br/>The Naga and Panaogao estates were acquired by the defendant, the first from his brother Julian on the 25th of November, 1881, and the second from Pedro Garganera on the 2d of November, 1898. There is not the slightest indication that the money with which these estates were purchased was or could be other than that of the purchaser himself. (Public instruments on pp. 350 and 401 of the record.) <br/><br/>It not having been proven that the property which it is sought to require one of the forced heirs, the defendant herein, to bring into collation was acquired gratuitously from the intestate, the action can not be maintained. <br/><br/>We therefore dismiss the complaint, with the costs of both instances to the plaintiff.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff is one of the next of kin, and the defendant the testamentary heir, of Santiago Velasco, who died at Namacpacan, in La Union, December 4, 1895. The plaintiff seeks a declaration that Velasco’s will is void on several grounds, only one of which, in the view we have taken of the case, it will be necessary to consider. <br/><br/>The will in question was an open one, executed before a notary and three witnesses. The date of the execution of the will is expressed therein in the following words, viz:  \"In San Fernando, on the twenty-second of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-three.\" The hour is not stated. It is claimed that this omission invalidates the will. <br/><br/>Book III, Title III, Chapter I, article 695, of the Civil Code, provides with reference to open wills as follows:  \"The testator shall express his last will to the notary and to the witnesses. After the testament has been drafted in accordance with the same, stating the place, year, month, day, and hour of its execution, it shall be read adoud,\" etc. Book III, Title III, Chapter I, article 687, provides that  \"Any will, in the execution of which the formalities respectively established in this chapter have not been observed, shall be void.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The word  \"formalities,\" in the connection in which it is here used, refers to the mode or form in which the juristic act of executing a will is to be performed. As respects each one of the several classes of wills established by the Code, certain directions are given as to the manner in which the intention of the testator must be expressed. Article 687, establishing a sanction to secure the observance of these rules, provides that if they are not followed, the will shall have no legal existence. <br/><br/>The sanction of article 687 is general. No exceptions are recognized. Its language excludes the idea of a distinction between essential and nonessential formalities. All the formalities prescribed are equally essential, and in order that an expression of testamentary intention may operate as a will, producing legal results as such, it must be clothed with all these formalities, however insignificant they may be in themselves, or however meaningless they may be when considered in relation to the circumstances of the particular case. <br/><br/>Such is obviously the effect of article 687 considered independently, and we find nothing in the other provisions of the Code on the subject of wills which directly modifies the meaning of this article or inferentially indicates a different legislative intent. <br/><br/>The place where and the time when a juristic act is performed are often material circumstances in determining its validity or consequences. Ordinarily the time relation of the act is sufficiently defined by fixing the year, month, and day. Article 695 provides that in an open will the time of execution must be fixed by expressing not only these details but also the hour. The law thus explicitly defines, as respects open wills, in what this particular formality shall consist. Nothing is left to inference, as would be the case, for example, if the provision were merely that the will should be dated. There is no room for interpretation. <br/><br/>Although a will has always been considered an essentially formal instrument, the expression of the date with the detail prescribed in article 695 is an unusual, and may perhaps be regarded as an unnecessary requirement. This provision, however, was not without precedent in foreign systems of legislation at the time of its enactment (see article 771 of the Civil Code of Guatemala of 1877), and it has since been followed in at least one foreign Code (see article 892 of the Civil Code of Honduras of 1899). <br/><br/>Its purpose is easily perceived. It is to provide against such contingencies as that of two competing wills executed on the same day (Quintus Mucius Scaevola, Commentaries, Vol. 12, p. 425; Manresa id., Vol. 5, p. 508), or of a testator becoming insane on the day on which the will was executed (Manresa, ubi supra). We may assume that the framers of the Code regarded the requirement as a desirable one for these and perhaps for other reasons. No. 15 of the law establishing the bases in accordance with which the Code was to be framed provides, with reference to the subject of successions, that  \"the substance of the existing legislation respecting testaments in general, their form and solemnities shall be maintained . . . and the law now in force reduced to order and systematized, and supplemented with such provisions as may tend to secure authenticity and facility in the expression of wills.\" The framers of the Code doubtless understood that in requiring in open wills the expression not only of the year, month, and day of their execution but also of the hour, they were following the precept of the law of bases by preserving the existing rule (Alcubilla, Dictionary of Spanish Administration, Vol. 9, p. 740) and providing an additional safeguard of authenticity. <br/><br/>But we are not concerned with the expediency of the provision in question, nor is it necessary for us to satisfy ourselves as to the considerations which led to its adoption. The language of the law is too plain and unambiguous to justify us in entering upon such inquiries for the purpose of ascertaining the legislative intent. And to the argument that the requirement has no appreciable practical utility and is calculated in a great majority of the cases in which it may be invoked for the purpose of invalidating a will to work injustice and hardship, by defeating the purposes of the testator and disappointing the expectations of his intended beneficiaries, it is a sufficient answer to say that we must administer the law not as we think it ought to be but as we find it and without regard to consequences. We are not authorized to distinguish where the law has made no distinction. If we could hold in this case that the expression of the hour might be omitted in an open will, we might, with equal reason, in a case where the testator’s testamentary capacity was unquestioned and no claim was made that the will had been revoked by a subsequent one, hold that the day, the month, or the year could be omitted; so we might hold that two witnesses instead of three were sufficient, and in short we might go on disregarding one formality after another, in order to subserve the justice of the particular case, until we had repealed the entire system established by the Code. <br/><br/>We have discovered nothing in the jurisprudence of the supreme court of Spain which is in conflict with the views above expressed. <br/><br/>In a decision of November 17, 1898, a holographic will dated January 2, 1895, but written on stamped paper of 1894, was held valid, although article 688 provides that in order that wills of this class may be valid they must be written  \"on stamped paper corresponding to the year of their execution.\" The decision is put upon the ground that the date of a holographic will is not absolutely determinative of the time of its execution; that the time of the execution of a holographic will, there being in that class of wills no legal requirement of unity of act, comprehends the entire period required to complete the work of drafting the will, provided there is no voluntary suspension of the work by the testator; that such period may and commonly does extend over several days; and that in the case then under consideration the proximity of the date of the will to the termination of the preceding year afforded reasonable ground for supposing that its execution had been begun in 1894. It is clear from the reasoning of the court that in a case where it was shown that stamped paper of a different year from that of the execution of the will had been used, the failure to comply with the requirement of the law would be held to entail the nullity of the will. <br/><br/>In a decision of April 6, 1896, the notary before whom an open will had been executed, certified in accordance with article 699 in the will that it had been read by him, but without using the precise language of article 695, which provides that the will shall be read  \"aloud.\" The court held that the statement of the notary sufficiently indicated that the formality of reading the will aloud as provided in article 695 had been followed. In this case also it is to be inferred that if it had not been impliedly stated by the notary that this formality had been complied with the omission to so state would have invalidated the will. <br/><br/>In a decision of April 4, 1895, a number of erasures, corrections, and interlineations made by the testator in a holographic will, had not been noted under the signature of the testator, as provided by paragraph 3 of article 688. It was held that the will was not thereby invalidated as a whole, but at most only as respects the particular words erased, corrected, or interlined. But the requirement of paragraph 3 of article 688 is not in any true sense one of the formalities of the holographic will, which are all enumerated in paragraph 2 of that article; it is a formality the scope of which is limited upon a proper construction of the law to the particular parts of the instrument affected by it. It is upon this ground, among others, that the decision is rested by the court, and the case is therefore no authority for the proposition that any of the formalities which in their nature affect the will as an entirety, applying equally to all parts of it, can be disregarded without rendering it invalid. <br/><br/>On the other hand, although the exact question presented in this case appears never to have been expressly decided, there are numerous cases in which wills have been declared void for nonobservance of formal requirements (judgments of February 16, 1891; May 31, 1893; May 5, 1897; July 14, 1899; February 12, 1901; June 1, 1901), and from the language used by the court in the judgments of June 5, 1894, and June 18, 1896, it may be fairly inferred that the provision in question is understood to be of a like imperative character. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed with costs, and the case is remanded to that court for the execution of the judgment. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper and Willard, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Mapa, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The case of the prosecution rests mainly upon the testimony of the person alleged to have been robbed — one Ri-Jhorumal, who is a young Hindoo boy employed in a shop on the Escolta in Manila. He testified — and to this extent his evidence is corroborated by his employer — that he was sent by the latter to the Tondo market to buy thread and given ten pesos in silver for that purpose. He states that he was robbed of this money in a street near the market by two men, one of whom held his hand over his month while the other took the money out of his pocket and ran away. He identifies the defendant as the man who held his hand over his mouth. He says this took place about 11 o’clock in the morning. He says that one Claudio Subit saw the occurrence, but Subit, having been called as a witness for the prosecution, denies this. On the part of the defense there was evidence from several witnesses which if believed establishes an alibi. <br/><br/>It is somewhat improbable that such an occurrence as that related by Ri-Jhorumal should have taken place in broad daylight in a central portion of a large city without attracting some one’s attention, and in view of this improbability, and in the absence of corroborating circumstances, we can not say that the evidence wholly excludes a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is reversed with costs de oficio, the case to be returned to that court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

The letter and spirit of the order itself are the most conclusive argument in support of this right on the part of the Government. <br/><br/>Its letter, because this right is thus expressly declared in section 43.  \"From all final judgments,\" it says,  \"of the Courts of First Instance or courts of similar jurisdiction, and in all cases in which the law now provides for appeals . . . an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court . . .\" If an appeal can be taken against all final judgments, the judgment of acquittal being also final judgment, it is evident that an appeal lies against a judgment of acquittal. This law grants the right of appeal in all cases in which it was formerly allowed by the local  \"existing laws,\" declared in force by section 1 of said General Orders, No. 58. If prior to this law the right of appeal in cases of acquittal was allowed, as will be more explicitly shown hereafter, now as then, and after the publication of said order, the right of appeal from judgments of acquittal will continue to be granted. <br/><br/>Moreover, section 64 is quite plain and reads as follows:  \"In case of appeal after judgment, the defendant may be admitted to bail pending action on the appeal: (1) As a matter of right if the appeal is from an acquittal . . .  \"Under the letter of the order, then, the Government has the right of appeal from an acquittal. <br/><br/>In its spirit, General Orders, No. 58, undoubtedly contemplates the allowance of the right of appeal from judgment of acquittal. Such phrases as that contained in section 43, to wit: \". . . in all cases in which the law now provides for appeals . . .,\" and the provision contained in section 50 to the effect that cases in the Supreme Court  \"shall thereafter take the same course as is now provided by law,\" or as that contained in section 107,  \"the privileges now secured by law to the person claiming to be injured by the commission of the crime . . .,\" show that the purpose of the legislator in this respect was to bring into the new law some of the provisions previously in force on the subject, and to establish a criminal procedure not entirely new, as are the majority of the provisions of General Orders, No. 58, based on principles of American law, but mixed, preserving part of the local legislation which is the principle upon which sections 50 and 107 are based. <br/><br/>Therefore, the right of the Government to appeal from a judgment of acquittal being well founded, the motion is overruled without costs. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

He was prosecuted on a criminal charge for an act done by him during the insurrection, but this was not an isolated act such as a  \"political offense committed during the insurrection pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities,\" but was a measure which, whether necessary or not, was inherent in the military insurrectionary authorities,\" but was a measure which, whether necessary or not, was inherent in the military operations for the preservation of the troops commanded by him and of which he was the supreme officer on that island. It was an act which, while from the standpoint of military law might be regarded as one of cruelty, was at the same time one depending absolutely upon the discretion of an officer in charge of a command for securing the safety of the troops under his control and constitutes no other offense than that of sedition, within which term the war itself is included by the letter and spirit of the proclamation. Therefore as the principal offenses of treason and sedition, committed by those who, by reason of their participation in the insurrections mentioned, were undergoing prosecution at the time of the publication of the amnesty proclamation fall within its scope, and as the accused took part against the United States in the insurrection by placing himself at the head of an armed troop, which in his judgment could not be saved from falling into the hands of the enemy except by means of the removal of a prisoner of war who could have put upon the tracks of the retreating forces the army which was entering the island, he is in our opinion guilty of an act which, although a violation of the laws of war, is one which was inherent in his military operations, and in consequence must be considered as an act of sedition. Lardizabal is, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation. <br/><br/>We therefore hold that he is entitled to the amnesty, upon condition of taking the oath prescribed by the proclamation, upon which the criminal case brought against him for murder shall be dismissed. <br/><br/>Torres and Cooper, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, concurs in the results of this opinion. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, dissents. </div>'\n",

According to the statement contained in this supplementary prayer the attached copy of the minutes of a meeting of the municipal council of Santa Cruz, Cavite,  \"shows the resolution adopted by the said council to impose upon landholders on the hacienda a tax of three pesos on each cavan of seed produced by the lands cultivated by them, for the purpose of paying the expenses of the suit, and the appointment of a collector and treasurer of this tax.\" This supplementary petition and the attached copy of the minutes were made the basis of a separate proceeding in the nature of a preliminary investigation. The provincial fiscal did not think proper to file an information, as he did not regard the facts set forth in the paper referred to as constituting the offense covered by the articles of the Penal Code cited by the representative of the corporation. The judge dismissed the complaint in the preliminary investigation. On the 23d of September, 1901, when the representative of the corporation appeared in court to file the formal complaint prepared by him, notice was served upon him of the order dismissing the proceeding. On the same day he appealed against this order, relying upon articles 43 and 44 of General Orders, No. 58. <br/><br/>Under the American system the prosecution of public offenses is reserved to the representative of the Government to such an extent that the individual citizen can not bring an action for that purpose. He is protected by his right to bring a personal action for the damage which the commission of a crime may occasion him. As to him the crime is but the source of a civil obligation. General orders, No. 58, series of 1900, which has established the principles and rules of criminal procedure peculiar to that system of legislation, as a concession to the period of transition from one system of legislation to another, has compromised only with the private penal action of the injured party, but with that of the latter alone — not with the action which under the former law on the subject of criminal procedure might be brought by any citizen who might desire to aid the action of the Government. It was necessary to maintain the private penal action of the injured party himself, in consequence of the continued operation of the Penal Code, for two reasons: First, because, on principle, the declaration of the criminal liability carries with it the declaration of the resulting civil obligation; second, because there are crimes which can not be prosecuted other than at the formal instance of the person injured. <br/><br/>For this reason, under the heading  \"rights of the person injured by the offense,\" article 107 was drawn, according to which,  \"the privilege now secured by law to the person claiming to be injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution of the offense and recover damages for the injury sustained by reason of the same shall not be abridged by the provisions of this order.\" It is evident that the special and accentuated inclusion of the right of the person injured, not recognized in the general principles which form the basis of this procedural system, is the most express exclusion of any other right, such as that arising from the popular penal action, not recognized in the American system. Until it is made to appear that the complainant corporation, domiciled in Manila, forms part of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz, Cavite, upon whom might fall the burden of this so-called illegal exaction, it has not been shown that the corporation has been or might be injured by the commission of the act denounced as a crime; consequently it has no right to bring a prosecution for such an act, nor to appeal against the denial of such a right, or the refusal to regard as a crime an act which in its opinion constitutes such an offense. <br/><br/>The appeal taken is therefore dismissed, with costs.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The evidence shows that the defendant and two other members of the Insular Police entered the house where Antonia Evangelista, a girl of 17 years of age, lived with her grandmother, Carmen Tayag, at about 7 o’clock in the evening of the 30th of March, 1902, in search of the girl’s father, who was at that time in Manila. The defendant and his companions took Carmen downstairs and tied her to a  \"chico\" tree, went upstairs where the girl Antonia had been left alone, and the three assailants then ravished her in succession, having stretched her upon the floor and stuffed a handkerchief into her mouth so as to prevent her from calling for help. The foregoing facts were corroborated by the witness Carmen Tayag and by Nicolasa Cruz, a neighbor of the injured party, who, from the window of her house, saw the girl Antonia in the hands of two men inside of the house where the occurrence took place, and shortly after heard the voice of the girl who was crying for help. Her cries were also heard by Paula Cruz, a relative of the victim, who lived near by. She came out of her house and unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the assailants from taking the girl Antonia away. The latter was carried to the barrio of Sucat and there, according to the testimony of the accused, who pleaded not guilty, she was again ravished by three other policemen. <br/><br/>These facts, as established by the testimony of creditable witnesses and the damaging evidence furnished by the statements of the defendant, constitute the crime of rape defined and punished under article 438 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the accused, in order to outrage the girl, used violence and intimidation, having been further aided by two others who, like himself, were armed with guns, they being members of the Insular Police. <br/><br/>The defendant heard the evidence of the complaining witness, who stated in her testimony that she knew the accused because he was a resident of the same town and gave a full account of the occurrence, and asked the girl if she was not mistaken in what she had stated to the court, to which she replied that all that she had testified to was true. The accused then testified that he did not rape the girl at all, but that the two constables, Catiple and Luis, did. He also stated that she was not raped at her house, but at the barrio of Sucat, where she was ravished by the two policemen already mentioned, one Batunbacal and Corporal Tagayum. These statements, in connection with those of the witnesses who either saw or heard of the occurrence and who also heard the noise caused by the struggle between the assailants and the victim, as well as the cries of the latter, prove conclusively the guilt of the accused, who was unable to present any exculpative evidence or adduce any in his defense. <br/><br/>In the commission of the offense in question there must be appreciated the attendance of the aggravating circumstance No. 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, there being no mitigating circumstances to be considered, as the offense was committed in the dwelling of the injured party, and without provocation. The adequate penalty must therefore be imposed in the minimum grade of the maximum degree. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated the judgment should, in our opinion, be reversed and the defendant sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of imprisonment, and to suffer the corresponding accessory penalty of temporary absolute disqualification, being subject to the surveillance of the authorities during his term of confinement and for a like period after the expiration thereof. Defendant shall pay to the injured party an indemnification in the amount of 300 Mexican pesos, being further obliged to recognize the issue that may be born, if its origin should not be a bar thereto, to support the same, and to pay the costs of this appeal. The judge, upon the filing of the necessary information for the five other crimes of rape enumerated on page 28 of the record, shall proceed in each case according to law.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a motion to dismiss the appeal of the United States taken from a judgment rendered August 15, 1902, by the Court of First Instance of Batangas, acquitting the appellee of the crime of robbery. <br/><br/>The question presented by the motion, namely, whether the Government is entitled, under the laws now in force in the Philippine Islands, to an appeal to this court in criminal cases from a judgment of acquittal of a Court of First Instance has been already passed upon in the case of the The United States v. Kepner in a decision rendered October 11, 1902. In an earlier decision in the same case (February 6, 1902) we had held that under the law as it stood prior to the enactment by Congress of the Philippines Bill, the Government was entitled to an appeal in the class of cases in question, and in the decision of October 11, 1902, we held that such right of appeal of the Government remained unaffected by the provisions of that act. Both these decisions were made after full argument and consideration, and we adhere to them, without deeming it necessary at this time to review the grounds upon which they were based. <br/><br/>One point made by counsel for the appellee upon the argument of this motion may, however, be briefly noticed, as it has perhaps not been heretofore suggested. Counsel contends, if we correctly apprehend his position, that the jurisdiction of this court, as defined in the law by which the court was created (Act No. 136 of the Commission) is of such a nature as necessarily to exclude the idea that the court can, like its predecessor, the Spanish Audiencia, review the whole case upon appeal; that the  \"appellate jurisdiction\" conferred upon it by Act No. 136 is ex vi termini a jurisdiction to correct errors of law merely. <br/><br/>This contention is, we think, founded on a misconception. By section 18 of Act No. 136 it is provided that  \"The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it from Courts of First Instance, and from other tribunals from whose judgment the law shall specially provide an appeal to the Supreme Court.\" The term  \"appellate jurisdiction\" is here used in a general sense, meaning simply a jurisdiction to review the judgment of the inferior court. Whether the jurisdiction is to reexamine the facts, or the law, or both, and with what limitations and under what conditions, is left undetermined by section 18, except as it is provided that it is to be exercised in  \"all actions and special proceedings properly brought to it\" from the tribunals described. To ascertain what cases may be properly brought to the Supreme Court for review and what matters may be reviewed in such cases, reference must be had to other provisions of law. By section 39 of the same Act  \"the existing Audiencia or supreme court\" was  \"abolished\" and this court  \"substituted in place thereof.\" Being substituted in place of the existing Audiencia, clearly its jurisdiction was the same as that tribunal possessed unless and until otherwise provided. Nowhere in Act No. 136 is its appellate jurisdiction defined as respects either civil or criminal cases. It was thus left exactly as it stood prior to the passage of that Act. In civil cases it remained that of the Audiencia until the change effected by the Code of Civil Procedure. In criminal cases the Commission has not seen fit up to the present time to modify it, and it therefore still remains identical with that exercised by the Audiencia. <br/><br/>If any doubt could be entertained that the intention of the Commission in the enactment of Act No. 136 was to preserve unaltered in this court the appellate jurisdiction of the Audiencia in criminal cases, it would be removed by Act No. 194, section 4, amending General Orders, No. 58, with reference to consultas in such cases, in the enactment of which the Commission must be presumed to have had in contemplation all its prior legislation on the same general subject, and in which the right of appeal of both the defendant and the Government is distinctly recognized.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The following facts were satisfactorily established by the evidence in the present case: That on the evening of the 13th of January, 1902, Eugenio Barbosa, a sergeant of Scouts, went to the house of Jose Baldosano in Bangued, head town of the district, where his wife, Ana Baldosano, the landlord’s daughter, lived. That no sooner had he arrived at the house than he again recriminated his wife, thinking that she was not faithful to him. That his father-in-law, in order to put an end to the dispute, told them to go settle their grievances in court, whereupon the defendant, Barbosa, replied that he alone was enough to judge himself and his wife too. That some time after 10 o’clock that night both husband and wife had supper and then went to bed. That about 2 o’clock next morning defendant got up and invited his wife to go downstairs in order to bid good-bye to an aunt of his, which they did, because he intended to take his wife the next day to the town where the company to which defendant belonged was stationed. That two hours after they had left the house, apparently on good terms, the defendant returned alone to the house and told the family, all of whom were in the house at the time, and which consisted of the parents, Guillermo Baldosano and Arcadia Veloso; their children, Guillermo and Antonio; Antero Flores, Felipa Veloso, and several others who were then present, that his wife, Ana Baldosano, had died and that they could go to get her body if they wished to; that the body was lying within a fenced piece of ground on the other side of the street near by and remarked to them that they would meet the same fate if they should attribute her death to any cause other than a disease of the stomach. His statements were heard by all the people in the house. That Guillermo Baldosano and Antero Flores immediately left the house and went in search of the body which they found at the place designated by the defendant, at the foot of a tree and about 20 or 30 yards from the house, to which the body was conveyed the same night. That when they were carrying the body away they noticed about the neck and throat indications that she had been choked, which led them to think that Barbosa had strangled his wife. That the body presented some dark spots about the throat caused by the pressure of his fingers. That the body was buried on the afternoon of the following day, the 14th of January, at the parish cemetery as per certificate (record, p. 52). <br/><br/>The offense in question has been duly established by competent and conclusive circumstantial evidence sufficient to define the crime as parricide as defined and punished under article 402 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Although the defendant pleaded not guilty to the crime with which he stands charged, the case, however, furnishes sufficient grounds upon which to base his conviction as the party responsible by direct participation for the death of his wife, Ana Baldosano. <br/><br/>The record satisfactorily shows that early in the evening of the 13th of January, 1902, the defendant upon his arrival at the house where his wife lived had been recriminating her on account of his jealousy; that late that night and about 2 o’clock defendant invited his wife to go downstairs, which they did, upon the unexplained pretext of bidding good-bye to an aunt of his; that two hours later defendant returned to the house alone and notified the parents of the girl as well as the rest of the people in the house that his wife had died, and told them to go to get the body if they wished to and which was to be found at the place designated by him; that instead of showing his grief and sorrow on account of the death of his wife, who he claimed had died of a disease of the stomach, he expressed himself unconcernedly and told those within his hearing that they were liable to be killed likewise should they attribute the death of his wife to any cause other than the said disease of the stomach. The finger marks found about the throat and neck of the victim also indicated that she had been choked. <br/><br/>The foregoing facts were properly established by the testimony of competent witnesses and constitute as many circumstances which taken together with the other merits of the case, considered in accordance with the principles of a sound discretion, and combined with each other, convince us of the guilt of the accused as the convicted author of the crime in question. Apart from the fact that it has not been proved that the deceased, who, previous to her death and at the time she left the house accompanied by her husband, was in good health, was taken with a pain in the stomach shortly afterwards and when she had walked for about 20 or 30 yards, it is impossible to conceive, and we are not inclined to believe that the death was due to a disease of the stomach. If this was true it seems natural that defendant and his wife should have returned to the house or that the husband should have endeavored to carry his sick wife to the house of her parents, which was but a short distance away, or, if this was not possible, he could have called on the relatives to aid his wife, who could have been left alone while he did so. But the accused did nothing of the kind and has not been able to explain at the trial this strange conduct, not at all consistent with the duties which a husband owes his wife. It does appear, however, that the defendant acted in such an unfeeling way toward the deceased that it may be safely inferred from the antecedents and other circumstances of the case that he was the murderer of his wife, having been actuated by the passion of jealousy and the hatred he felt toward his wife, whom he thought was untrue to him. <br/><br/>It can not be said that the circumstantial evidence referred to has been contradicted at all by the witnesses to the alibi presented by the defense. The testimony of the witnesses who testified that defendant had been at the barracks all night is not worthy of credence since some of them were absent from the building dancing at a house from about 9 to 12 o’clock that night and others were asleep and therefore could not know positively whether the accused had been absent from his quarters or not. The barracks had three doors and there was a sentry at one of them only. It can not be held as having been established by the evidence that on the morning of the 14th of January he was notified that his wife had died of a disease of the stomach, because the brother of the victim denies having made such a report to him, and further because the true author of the crime and the one who informed and threatened the family of the deceased did not require such notice. <br/><br/>It must be finally remarked that the contradictions which appear in the testimony of witnesses for the defendant discredit their own statements, which could not be properly accepted. The fact that a majority of the witnesses for the Government are near relatives of the deceased does not lessen in the least the weight of their testimony. The statements of these witnesses, far from evincing any falseness, corroborate facts which coincide with other undeniable ones, all of which are conclusive circumstantial evidence tending to show the existence of the crime and the criminal responsibility of its author. <br/><br/>As respects the certificate of the burial of the body, it may be said that the probatory force of this document is confined only to the fact of the death and burial of Ana Baldosano, and the information as to the cause of her death, given by the person or persons who carried the body, was mere hearsay. And if it is certain that against all truth and reality the brother of the deceased had told the priest and the parish sexton that she had died of a disease of the stomach, is it not also probable that the said brother acted under the influence of the threats made by defendant shortly after the commission of the crime? This is not improbable, nor is it likewise impossible that the accused, taking advantage of his rank as sergeant of Scouts, should have himself instructed the party how to draft the certificate of burial in the same manner as he secured and prepared the evidence of his alibi. <br/><br/>From a careful examination of the record and from the statements of the parents and brothers of the deceased, as well as from the testimony of the accused, it appears that while the unfortunate family of the deceased was overcome with fear, the accused evinced unusual boldness and forwardness, trusting, as he had repeatedly said during the trial, that his superior officers would defend him, basing his statements also on certain unfounded privileges he claimed he had in the organization to which he belonged, he having been defended by the governor of the province, an unusual occurrence in a criminal case. <br/><br/>In the commission of so grave a crime there should be appreciated the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, article 10, No. 5, of the Code, and that defined in article 11 of the same as mitigating, since it clearly appears that the accused took advantage of the darkness and stillness of the night, at a time when all the neighbors were in bed, order to commit the crime; also that the defendant by reason of his personal circumstances of race and lack of education allowed himself to be influenced by the overpowering passion of jealousy which originated the crime. These two circumstances compensate each other in their effects, and for this reason the penalty applicable to the crime would be the less severe of the two indivisible ones prescribed in article 402 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Beyond these we think that no other should be considered, not even those of premeditation and treachery, appreciated by the court below in its judgment, since the case does not furnish any evidence to the effect that Barbosa had formed the deliberate, premeditated intention to take the life of his wife, and there was no eyewitness as to the manner in which the deceased was strangled; consequently there is no provision of law under which we can hold that the crime was committed with treachery, and it must be borne in mind that the qualifying circumstances of a crime in its commission, in order to be considered, must be established by competent evidence as well as the crime to which they relate. <br/><br/>The other points made by the defense were that the testimony of the witnesses for the Government was elicited by leading questions, and that the investigation at the trial was not directed in the first place to determining whether or not a crime had been committed. In this behalf it must be observed that the witnesses in their replies to these questions gave an explanation of the facts and occurrences to which they testified, and that the same facts and occurrences were also affirmed in the two preliminary investigations held. These matters were affirmed without contradiction at the trial, in which both the commission of the crime and the identity of the criminal were proven. The law of criminal procedure does not require that the investigation be conducted in the order which counsel for the accused considers to have been committed in this case. It is true that the existence of a crime is a condition precedent to that of the liability of the supposed criminal, but it is also unquestionably true that the investigation can not be limited to the fact of the crime in the abstract without regard to the guilty agent, inasmuch as the proof of the crime necessarily involves the personality of the agent to such a degree that it is not possible to separate them. The concept of the crime is always subjective and not objective, and it is not possible to conceive the existence of a punishable act or omission without that of the guilty agent. Such has been the procedure in this case in which the investigation of the cause of the decease of Ana Baldosano has resulted in the proof showing that she met a violent death willfully caused by her own husband. <br/><br/>For the foregoing reasons this court finds: (1) That the offense as established by the evidence constitutes the crime of parricide in the commission of which there must be appreciated the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and the mitigating circumstance defined in article 11 of the Penal Code. (2) That the defendant Eugenio Barbosa as convicted is the only party responsible therefor by direct participation. (3) That he has incurred the lower of the two indivisible penalties prescribed in article 402 of the Code and the accessory penalties Nos. 2 and 3 of article 54. (4) That he has likewise incurred civil liability without subsidiary personal responsibility, with costs. <br/><br/>Wherefore in our opinion the judgment consulted and appealed from should be reversed and the defendant, Eugenio Barbosa, sentenced to life imprisonment with the accessory penalties of civil interdiction, being subject to the vigilance of the authorities during the period of his life; and should the principal penalty be remitted he shall in any event suffer the accessory penalties of perpetual absolute disqualification and shall further be subject to the surveillance of the authorities during the term of his natural life if the same should have not been remitted together with the principal penalty; and we further sentence him to pay an indemnification in the sum of $1,000, Mexican, to the heirs of the deceased, with costs of both instances. The judge shall proceed in accordance with law in regard to the embargoed property of the defendant. It is so ordered and adjudged. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>It was plainly proven at the trial that Guillermo Baldosano, the most intelligent of the witnesses for the Government, on the morning after the death of his sister notified the parish sexton that she had died of a disease of the stomach. Nothing was said by any of the family to the contrary, and no complaint was made to the public authorities until the 26th day of January. It is said that this action of Guillermo and this silence of the family were due to the threats alleged to have been made by the defendant on the night of the 13th. There would be some force to this claim were it not for the facts which lead up to the complaint made on January 26. It appears from this complaint that on this day the defendant went to the house of his father-in-law and asked for his trunk, that he was told that it had been pawned to pay the expenses of his wife’s funeral; that he then threatened to kill the family if it was not delivered to him in two hours. It appears that the trunk was worth 4 pesos. In this complaint the killing of the woman is only incidentally mentioned. The petition is that the defendant be prevented from carrying out his threats in regard to the trunk. <br/><br/>The threats of the defendant seem to have been efficacious when the matter involved was his prosecution for the murder of his wife, but to have lost their effects when the matter involved was the payment by the family of 4 pesos. <br/><br/>Four witnesses for the defendant testified that as the company was about to march away on the morning of the 14th a person, whom the defendant then told them was his brother-in-law, Guillermo Baldosano, came to the barracks and notified the defendant of the death of his wife. If this testimony is true, it is impossible to believe that the occurrence testified to by the witnesses of the Government ever took place. <br/><br/>It is also strange that the five witnesses for the Government should all have been awake at 2 o’clock in the morning, when they say that the defendant and his wife left the house. <br/><br/>It is, of course, possible that this testimony is true, but I have such serious doubts as to whether the defendant was at the house at all after 7 o’clock that evening that I can not agree to a judgment of conviction. <br/><br/>Ladd, <em>J.</em>, I concur with the dissenting opinion. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Geronimo Torrente is accused of the crime of lesiones graves committed in the following manner:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>That the defendant on the afternoon of March 15, 1902, in the city of Manila, maltreated his niece, Jacinta de Leon, a maiden of 17 years of age, by striking her, kicking her, and burning her with carbolic acid for not having acceded to his lustful desires. <br/><br/>The defendant pleaded not guilty. The trial resulted in a conviction of the defendant by the lower court of the offense of lesiones menos graves as defined in article 418 or the Penal Code, and he was sentenced to five months and a day of arresto mayor. <br/><br/>He appeals from this judgment. <br/><br/>The trial of the case having been fixed for the first of May, 1902, on account of the alleged unavoidable absence of the defendant’s attorney from the city of Manila, he asked for a suspension of the trial, which was denied him. <br/><br/>The refusal of the trial court to grant the continuance is assigned as error. This assignment of error is not borne out by the record. From it, it appears that the case having been called for trial the defendant produced a telegram from his attorney to the effect that he could not come  \"on account of accident to boiler.\" The judge thereupon required the defendant to employ other counsel, and, the defendant having stated that he was unable to do so, the court appointed Señor Monroy de oficio as his attorney. No objection was made by the defendant to proceeding to trial after the assignment of Señor Monroy as counsel; he acquiesced in the action of the court and proceeded to trial without further objection. <br/><br/>The case appears to have been tried in a proper and skillful manner and no essential right of the accused has been prejudiced. Besides, no reason is given why the defendant’s counsel should have been absent. The case had been continued once before, and the circumstances of the absence of his attorney were not shown, except that he was delayed by an accident. <br/><br/>Another objection to the judgment is that it is contrary to the law and the evidence, in that it does not appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the intention of the accused was to commit the crime of which he was convicted, nor does it appear that the injured party was incapacitated for a period of eight days or more on account of the injuries received. This objection requires a review of the evidence. <br/><br/>The testimony of Jacinta de Leon, the injured girl, shows that she was 16 years old, and on the 15th day of March lived with her aunt, the defendants wife; that while she was lying on the bed on the 15th of March, taking a siesta, she was approached by the defendant, who made an improper proposal to her; that he kissed her, whereupon she arose from the bed and went into the presence of her aunt; that the defendant put on his shoes and went off; after a time she saw that he was coming toward her and she sat down, whereupon he struck her; that she said nothing because she did not know what wrong she had done. He again struck her and gave her a kick and said that she must leave the house; that she dressed herself and went off in order that his rage might pass away, and being about to go out the defendant followed her, having in his hand a bottle of acid which he threw in her face; that raising her hand the hand of the defendant was struck and a part of the contents was spilled; that she entered the hospital for treatment of the burns, and was two weeks being cured. <br/><br/>The defendant gives quite a different version of the occurrence. He testifies that he was leaving the house on the evening of the day in question to disinfect a water-closet, and had in his hand a bottle of carbolic acid; that the noise he made awoke his wife who asked him where he was going, and upon his replying she said that he could not go out and seized him by the shoulder; that being unable by her strength to prevent him from leaving the house, she called to her niece and commanded her to assist her; that in his effort to disengage himself from his wife and the niece, and not recollecting that the bottle had no stopper, the acid was spilled upon the girl, a part of it falling on himself. In this statement the defendant is corroborated by the testimony of his wife. <br/><br/>We are disposed to take the version of the injured girl as true and to discard entirely the statements of the husband and wife The girl’s statement shows not only a gross violation of confidence resulting from the relationship existing between her and the defendant, but discloses a case of most brutal and cruel conduct to an unoffending person. There is no conceivable reason why such a charge should have been falsely made by the injured girl; on the contrary, it appears that from some influence exercised upon her she very unwillingly appeared in court to testify. She failed to appear at the time fixed for the trial and it was only through the process of the court that her testimony was secured. There were strong motives on the part of the defendant to exculpate himself, and there was the natural desire upon the part of the wife to relieve him of his embarrassment. <br/><br/>It is also assigned as error that the court erred in overruling the defendant’s motion for a new trial based upon the ground of newly discovered evidence. <br/><br/>Attached to the application is the affidavit of Damos de Leon, the father of the injured girl, in which he states that Jacinta was not incapacitated from following her ordinary pursuits and that she recovered within six days from the time she entered the hospital. <br/><br/>Also the affidavit of Doctor Juan Miciano, the attending physician of the hospital of San Juan de Dios, where the injured girl was treated, who states that Jacinta de Leon entered the hospital on account of burns caused by carbolic acid in the face and on the right arm, and that she was cured in nine days from her entrance in the hospital without any deformity or permanent physical disability being occasioned, there only remaining white spots as the result of the burns. <br/><br/>This last affidavit sustains the charge that the injuries were more than eight days in curing, and the testimony of this witness could strengthen the case of the prosecution. There is no reason shown why the testimony of Damos de Leon was not known before the trial, and the witness produced at the trial. <br/><br/>The difficulty has not been so much in reaching a conclusion in view of the conflict in the evidence as in discovering adequate punishment under the present laws for the defendant. <br/><br/>The offense was of a most brutal character, and the punishment which we affix we regard as wholly inadequate to the case. <br/><br/>Article 418 of the Penal Code provides that injuries which shall render the injured person unable to work for eight days or more, or which shall require the care of a physician for a similar period, shall be punished with arresto mayor, or banishment and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas, in the discretion of the court, and when such injuries shall we inflicted with manifest intent of outrage, or under humiliating, circumstances, in addition to arresto mayor a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas may be imposed. <br/><br/>The evidence shows manifest intent of outrage, and in addition to this there were other circumstances which should have been taken into consideration. The offense was committed with alevosia, and also with abuse of confidence; both of which are circumstances which aggravate criminal liability. (Paragraphs 2 and 10, article 10, Penal Code.) <br/><br/>The judgment of the lower court will be reversed, and judgment is now here entered convicting the defendant or lesiones menos graves inflicted with the manifest intent of outrage, and with the attending aggravating circumstances defined in paragraphs 2 and 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code; and he is sentenced to imprisonment of arresto mayor for the period of six months, and to pay a fine of 3,250 pesetas, and in the event of insolvency on the part of the defendant he is sentenced to subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for every 12-1/2, pesetas of the fine, such subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed two months. <br/><br/>Costs of suit are also adjudged against the defendant.

The defendants and four other individuals constituted an armed band by whom the act was committed. <br/><br/>After the arraignment and after the trial was commenced Santiago Solitario died. The defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso were tried and found guilty and were condemned to the penalty of six years and one day of prision mayor and accessories, and each to.pay their part of the costs of the suit. From this judgment the defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso appeal. <br/><br/>It is contended that the proof was insufflcient to sustain the conviction, that such acts as were proven do not constitute illegal detention. <br/><br/>After a careful examination of the record we reach the conclusion that the evidence contained therein is sufficient to support the conviction. <br/><br/>Modesto Balasigue, one of the youths detained, testifies that on the 24th day of September of last year he and Abdon Somera were hunting wild hogs at the place called Sacumbaca, and that they were sequestrated by several individuals; that there were six persons in the band, all armed, some carrying guns and others bolos; that the defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso carried bolos; that witness was detained by the defendants four days, when he escaped from their custody. At the time he escaped Abdon Somera was still held by them. That he is able to identify the defendants as being the persons who had him in custody, since he was in their company during the time he was held by them. <br/><br/>Three municipal police testified as to the capture of the defendants and as to finding in their possession the boy Abdon Somera and three stolen carabaos. <br/><br/>Meliton Carlos, president of the municipal ity of San Miguel de Mayumo, testified that these defendants were captured by the police; that he was in company with the police when they captured them, and that the defendants had in their possession Abdon Somera and some carabaos. This witness ~;estifies that upon capturing the defendants they admitted that they had carried off Abdon Somera to San Miguel de Mayumo.The testimony of this witness and that of the police as to the confession made by the defendants is not entirely consistent. The first affirms that the defendants said they carried off Abdon Somera to San Miguel de Mayumo, while the police indicate in their testimony that what was said about the carrying off of Abdon Somera was related by Abdon Somera himself. However, it appears very clear from the statements of these witnesses that Abdon Somera and the carabaos were found in the possession of the defendants. <br/><br/>The testimony of Modesto Balasigue is sufficient to support the conviction independent of any confessions that may have been made by the defendants when captured. we clearly identifies the defendants as the parties who carried him and Abdon Somera off, and he states that after four days of detention he made his escape while grazing the carabaos. <br/><br/>No explanation is made why the boy Abdon Somera was not adduced as a witness at the trial. But, as stated, the case is fully proven by Modesto Balasigue. <br/><br/>The judge of the Court of First Instance gave the defendants the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance and failed to take into consideration the aggravating circumstance of the offense having been committed by an armed band in cuadrilla. <br/><br/>We can see no just reason for giving these defendants the benefit of article 11, nor can we see any cause for not taking into consideration the aggravating circumstance of the act having been committed in cuadrilla. For this reason we will set aside the judgment of the lower court and enter the proper judgment, which is, that the defendants Carlos Santiago and Jacinto Alfonso are guilty of the offense of unlawful detention defined and punishable under article 481 of the Penal Code, and we condem them to the punishment of ten years and one day of prision mayor in its maximum degree and accessories, and to the costs of the proceedings. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The appellants, Bonifacio Plana, Emigdio Yadao, and Romualdo Ines, have been convicted by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte of robbery en cuadrilla. <br/><br/>The private prosecutor is one Francisca Guerrero, a resident of Laoag, in Ilocos Norte. She testifies that on the evening of November 21, 1901, as she was traveling along the highway in a cart a little north of Sinait, in Ilocos Sur, accompanied by Monica Calong and Pedro Juan, the latter the driver of the cart, the party were overtaken in an uninhabited place called Santa Cruz in the pueblo of Badoc, in Ilocos Norte, by three men, armed with talibones, who had compelled them to turn round and go back; that they had gone but a short distance in that direction when some thirty more men, armed with talibones and clasp knives, emerging from the bushes on both sides of the road, ordered them to get out of the cart and compelled the witness by threats of death to disclose the fact that she had some money in a basket in the cart, which they thereupon opened and from which they took 200 pesos in Mexican silver, some pieces of cloth, and other articles. Monica Calong and Pedro Juan in substance give the same account of the occurrence, except that the latter says he was taken into the goods by the robbers, where he was kept under guard for about an hour, and so did not witness the actual rifling of the basket. <br/><br/>There appears to be no sufficient reason to question the fact of the robbery as related by these witnesses, but as to the participation of the appellants in the crime we are unable to free our minds from grave doubt. <br/><br/>The private prosecutor says it was a clear, moonlight night, and that she recognized the appellants, all of whom she had known previously. It appears that she had been in Santa Catalina in Ilocos Sur just previously to the robbery, and was on her way to her home in Laoag when the robbery took place. She says she was sick for a week at Santa Catalina, and that during that time the appellant Plana made several visits at the house where she was stopping and that she bought a carriage and two horses from him for 120 pesos, of which she paid 100 pesos down; that the carriage was in Vigan, and that she went there and got it, and started out with it for Laoag, and that Plana followed her as far as Bantay; that she then proceeded on to San Ildefonso where she stayed overnight; that that night Plana was arrested in front of the house where she was stopping, for what reason she does not know; that the next afternoon he was released and she let him take the carriage so that he could go back to Santa Catalina; that the next morning at 2 o’clock the carriage was returned to her by a little boy; that these things greatly surprised the witness and that she made up her mind that Plana was not a good man, and told the boy to take the carriage back to Plana, as she withdrew from the bargain, and that Plana must return her the money, which, however, he did not do; and that somebody told her afterwards that Plana promised to revenge himself upon her for what she had done. <br/><br/>As respects the other two appellants she says she became acquainted with them at Sinait, where she stopped on the journey from Laoag to Santa Catalina, the occasion being a musical entertainment which they and Gaspar Ines, who she says was another one of the bandits, gave at the house where she was stopping<br/><br/>Monica Calong’s evidence as respects the identity of the appellants is the same as that of the private prosecutor, and she says she made their acquaintance at the same time as the latter in Santa Catalina and Sinait respectively. She also testifies to the same effect as respects the sale of the carriage and horses by Plana to the private prosecutor, and there is another witness who confirms the testimony of the private prosecutor as to this transaction to some extent. <br/><br/>Pedro Juan, the driver of the cart, is much less positive in his identification of Plana, merely saying that  \"to judge by the appearance and figure of the accused Bonifacio Plana,\" he was one of the robbers. He says that he did not recognize the other two appellants. <br/><br/>The defense was an alibi, supported by numerous witnesses. <br/><br/>Our doubts as to the identity of the appellants arise not so much from the strength of the alibi as from the somewhat suspicious character of the evidence of the private prosecutor and from the inherent probabilities of the case. So far as the transaction respecting the sale of the carriage and horses is concerned, there would appear to be more reason to suppose that the private prosecutor might desire to take revenge upon Plana for not returning the money by preferring a false accusation against him than that Plana should desire to take revenge upon her for rescinding the bargain by robbing her. The same consideration applies to some extent to the testimony of Monica Calong who seems to have been closely associated with the private prosecutor. Moreover, it seems somewhat improbable that Plana, who appears to have been a man of some property and position, should, on a clear, moonlight night, and without having disguised himself, attack and rob on the public highway persons with whom he had business dealings just previously and who would be almost certain to recognize him. <br/><br/>To these considerations is to be added the significant fact that the driver of the cart fails to satisfactorily identify Plana, and does not undertake to identify the other two appellants. <br/><br/>In a case like the present, the determination of which depends upon the credit which is to be accorded to the direct testimony of a few witnesses, uncorroborated by circumstances, and deprived as we are of the aid which would be afforded by an opportunity to see the witnesses and hear them testify, we can not avoid giving to such considerations as those to which we have adverted a weight to which they would not perhaps have been found to be entitled if the trial had been before us in the first instance, or if the case had been more fully developed below. We are led, for these and other reasons which need not be stated, to the conclusion that the judgment of conviction must be reversed and the appellants acquitted, with costs de oficio. Let the cause be returned to the court below for proceedings in conformity with this opinion. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

No legal reason is given for such an exclusion. The credits and property in question pertained to the extinguished partnership, hence the interest that each partner has therein is unquestionable. Therefore it is not possible to consider the liquidation as finally settled and ended or determine which of the partners is the true debtor according thereto; consequently the judgment excepted to can not be sustained, as it does not definitely decide or determine the question pending as to the mere exclusion or omission of the sum referred to. This item, having been acknowleged by both parties, should necessarily be included in the final settlelllent of the affairs of tlle partnership, and must be taken into account in the liquidation and determination of the suit pending between the parties. <br/><br/>The profit and loss of the partnership must be divided in the manner stipulated, and if the agreement should only refer to the participation of each partner in the profits then their corresponding share of the losses shall be in the same ratio. <br/><br/>In the absence of an agreement the share of each partner in the profits and losses shall be in proportion to what he may have contribnted.

The industrial partner can not claim for himself any part of tlle-property contributed; he can share only in the profits and benefits, in conformity with the provisions of article 1689, if the contrary should have not been expressly stipulated. <br/><br/>The judgment rendered below and brought before us on exception should have decided the issues in accordance with these legal principles and the provisions contained in the Civil Code with respect to the division of estates among heirs. <br/><br/>Without the inclusion of the amount referred to as having been omitted in the liquidation and final settlement of tlle business engaged in by the partnership existing, between the parties there could be no legal means of fixing definitely in the final liquidation and decision of the case the amount of profits and losses had by the partnership. For this reason the judgment appealed can not be sustained. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction can either affirm, reverse, or modify any final judgment, order, or decree and can direct that the proper;judgment be entered, or that a new trial be had. The latter, in the opinion of this court, could be the proper action in the case before us, so that after a complete liquidation is made final judgment may be rendered in the premises. Therefore, in view of the provisiolls of article 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure and for the foregoing reasons, this court deems it proper that the final judgment exepted to by defendant, Nery Linan, be set aside and a new trial had upon the issues raised by the parties, the judge to proceed in accordance with law, with no special order as to the costs of this instance. It is so ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J. </em> Cooper and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, with whom LADD, <em>J.</em>, concurs, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I dissent. There is no certificate by the judge nor any statement in the bill of exceptions that it, the bill of exceptions, contains all the evidence produced and all the proceedings had at the trial in the court below. on the contrary it plainly appears from the contents thereof that it does not contain all the proceedings. The appellee made two motions in this court that the entire record be sent here in order that the imperfections in the bill of exceptions might be corrected. These motions were opposed by the appellant and denied by this court. Why the court below excluded this sum of $18,712.08 3/4 from the accounting does not appear. To the judgment which so excluded it the appellant took no exception. removed for a new trial on the ground that the findings of fact were manifestly against the weight of the evidence, but said nothing about any error of law in excluding this sum from the accounting. It is more than probable that it consisted almost entirely of uncollectible accounts due the firm. That each party charged the other with the loss suffered by reason of the uncollectibility of these accounts does appear. The parties may have preferred to leave them out of the liquidation, each one retaining his interest in them and dividing between themselves later anything realized from them. It is not unlikely that if we had the whole record before us it could appear that the appellant consented that this item might be left out. The appellant ought not to be allowed to bring here an incomplete record, to oppose all efforts to have it perfected, and to secure a reversal of the juclgment, when if we had before us all that the court below had before it when the judgment was rendered such judgment might have to be affirmed. </div>'\n",

He says he took it from one of the bandits when he separated from the band. he also admits that he had a revolver, which was given to him by Isidro Mendigoren, the leader of the band, and which he turned over to one Munti from whom it appears to have been recovered by the inspectors. It does not appear whether or not this revolver was the one taken from the convent. <br/><br/>The defense of sequestration is a familiar one in these cases, and is of such a character as not to be entitled to much consideration unless supported by stront evidence. Not only is there here no evidence that the defendant was an involuntary member of the band, except his own assertion to that effect, but the circumstance that the leader of the band allowed him to carry a revolver strongly discredits any such theory. We can entertain no doubt as to the defendant’s guilt. <br/><br/>There was no evidence as to how the bandits effected an entrance into the convent. The conviction under article 508 of the Code can not, therefore, be supported. The defendant is convicted of the crime defined in No. 5 of article 503 in connection with article 504, with the aggravating circumstance of article 10, No. 20, and the penalty fixed at ten years of presidio mayor, with costs.

The defendant Exequiel Castillo paid Catalino Circa the sum of $10 for lending his assistance. <br/><br/>The defendant Exequiel Castillo was convicted and sentenced to the penalty of death as the author of the crime, and the defendant Catalino Circa was sentenced to ten years of presidio mayor as an accessory after the fact. <br/><br/>The defendant Exequiel Castillo has appealed to this court. <br/><br/>Catalino Circa does not appeal from the judgment. <br/><br/>The proof offered by the Government at the trial against Exequiel Castillo consists of confessions made by Catalino Circa to various persons, and of the latter’s statements made on the preliminary investigation before the provincial fiscal. It will be unnecessary to review this testimony. <br/><br/>On the trial of the case the defendant Catalino Circa testified in behalf of defendants and contradicted the truth of these statements, claiming that he was induced to make them by Agustin Castro, a brother of the deceased, and denying all knowledge whatever of the commission of the offense. <br/><br/>The judge of the Court of First Instance tools into consideration these confessions and the testimony given on the preliminary investigation, and found the defendants guilty under this proof. <br/><br/>Section 15 of General Orders, No. 58, provides that in all criminal prosecutions the defendant shall be entitled to be confronted at the trial by and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. <br/><br/>This right has been denied the defendant Exequiel Castillo. <br/><br/>Neither the confessions of Catalino Circa nor his testimony given on the preliminary hearing, can be received against Exequiel Castillo, and the Court of First Instance erred in admitting them. <br/><br/>\"Where the testimony of a witness for the prosecution has previously been taken down by Question and answer in the presence of the accused or his counsel, the defense having had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the deposition of the latter may be read, upon satisfactory proof to the court that he is dead or insane, or can not with due diligence be found in the Islands.\" (Sec. 15, General Orders, No. 58.) <br/><br/>In no other cases than those specified in this section can the testimony introduced at the preliminary examination be received at the trial. <br/><br/>We have heretofore decided, and have directed the attention of judges of the Courts of First Instance to the fact, that the testimony taken on a preliminary investigation can not be received at the trial of the cause unless falling within one of these exceptions. The preliminary proof has no place in the record sent to this court. <br/><br/>The proof stands upon a different ground with reference to Catalino Circa. His confessions made to witnesses may be admissible against him. But they are not admissible against his codefendant. It is unnecessary to consider the sufficiency of these confessions as against Catalino Circa. He has not appealed from the judgment. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance convicting and sentencing the defendant Exequiel Castillo to the death penalty is reversed and defendant Castillo is acquitted and directed to be discharged, without prejudice to that part of the judgment convicting and sentencing the defendant Catalino Circa to the penalty in which he is condemned.

The prosecuting attorney appealed against this decision, believing that the crime should be punished in accordance with article 508 of the Code, this being the only question which has been raised on this appeal. <br/><br/>The evidence shows that the malefactors were armed with guns and bolos; that the robbery of the clothes was committed in an inhabited house and the robbery of the carabaos in buildings connected with inhabited houses; that the value of the carabaos stolen (the value of the clothing not having been properly ascertained) exceeded 1,250 pesetas; and finally that the malefactors entered the place were the robbery was committed by scaling a fence which protected it and which was of quite a considerable height. <br/><br/>If any of these circumstances had been lacking the case should have been tried under article 503, paragraph 5, as the judge held.

No mention was made in the lease of any future sale of the property. It was never inscribed in the registry of property. On December 6, 1900, Doña Eumelia sold the property to the plaintiff. No mention of the lease was made in the deed and the grantor stated therein that the property was free from all incumbrance. On December 14, 1900, the plaintiff notified the tenant that he-must vacate the house at the end of the month or pay 80 pesos a month thereafter. The tenant refused to either pay this increased rent or to vacate the premises and prior to January 11, 1901, deposited with a notary the rent for December and January at the rate of 26 pesos a month. The plaintiff took from the notary the rent for December under the protest contained in the receipt which she then gave, but refused to take the rent for January. On March 11, 1901, she commenced this action for unlawful detainer against Miller and his wife. It was defended by Doña Eumelia, the lessor. <br/><br/>She claimed that there was a verbal agreement between her and the plaintiff at the time of the sale to the effect that the lease should be respected.

The court below issued a preliminary injunction during the trial, but, upon rendering final judgment, dissolved the injunction, with the costs against the plaintiff. The latter excepted to this judgment and assigns error. <br/><br/>In the trial the following facts were admitted without contradiction:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tThat house No. 65 Calle Rosario, this city, property of the wife of the plaintiff, has certain windows therein, through which it receives light and air, said windows opening on the adjacent house, No. 63 of the same street; (2) that these windows have been in existence since the year 1843, and (3) that the defendant, the tenant of the said house No. 63, has commenced certain work with the view to raising the roof of the house in such a manner that one-half of one of the windows in said house No. 65 has been covered, thus depriving the building of a large part of the air and light formerly received through the window. In its decision the court below practically finds the preceding facts, and further finds that the plaintiff has not proven  that he has, by any formal act, prohibited the owner of house No. 63 from making improvements of any kind therein at all time prior to the complaint. <br/><br/>The contention of the plaintiff is that be the constant and uninterrupted use of the windows referred to above during a period of fifty-nine years he acquired by prescription an easement of light in favor of the house No. 65, and as a servitude upon house No. 63, and, consequently, has acquired the right to restrain the making of any improvements in the latter house which might in an manner be prejudicial to the enjoyment of the said easement. He contends that the easement of light is positive; and that therefore the period of possession for the purposes of the acquisition of a prescriptive title is to begin from the date on which the enjoyment of the same commenced, or, in other words, applying the doctrine to this case, from the time that said windows were opened with the knowledge of the owner of the house No. 63, and without opposition on his part. <br/><br/>The defendant, on the contrary, contends that the easement is negative, and that therefore the time for the prescriptive acquisition thereof must begin from the date on which the owner of the dominant estate may have prohibited, by a formal act, the over of the servient estate from doing something which would be lawful but for the existence of the easement. <br/><br/>The court below in its decision held that the easement of light is negative, and this ruling has been assigned by the plaintiff as error to be corrected by this court. <br/><br/>A building may receive light in various manners in the enjoyment of an easement of light, because the openings through which the light penetrates may be made in one’s own wall, in the wall of one’s neighbor, or in a party wall. The legal doctrine applicable in either one of these case is different, owing to the fact that, although anyone may open windows in his own wall, no one has a right to do so in the wall of another without the consent of the owner, and it is also necessary, in accordance with article 580 of the Civil Code, to obtain the consent of the other coowner when the opening is to be made in a party wall. <br/><br/>This suit deals with the first case; that is, windows opened in a wall belonging to the wife of the plaintiff, and it is this phase of the easement which it is necessary to consider in this opinion. <br/><br/>When a person opens windows in his own building does nothing more than exercise an act of ownership inherent in the right of property, which, under article 348 of the Civil Code, empowers him to deal with his property as he may see fit, with no limitations other than those established by law. By reason of the fact that such an act is performed wholly on a thing which is wholly the property of the one opening the window, it does not in itself establish any easement, because the property is used by its owner in the exercise of dominion, and, not as the exercise of an easement:  \"For a man,\" says law 13, title 31, third partida,  \"should not use that which belongs to him as if it were service only, but as his own property.\" Coexistent with this right is the right of the owner of the adjacent property to cover up such windows by building on his own land or raising a wall contiguously to the wall in which the windows are opened (art. 581 of the same code), by virtue of the reciprocity of rights which should exist between abutting owners, and which would cease to exist if one could do what he pleased on his property and the other could not do the same on his. Hence it is that the use of the windows opened in a wall on one’s own property, in the absence of some covenant or express agreement to the contrary, is regarded as an act of mere tolerance on the part of the owner of the abutting property judgments of the supreme court of Spain of the 17th of May, 1876; 10th of May, 1884; 30th of May, 1890), and does not create any right to maintain the windows to the prejudice of the latter (judgment of the supreme court of Spain of the 13th of June, 1877). The mere toleration of such an act does not imply on the part of the abutting owner a waiver of his right to freely build upon his land as he may see fit, nor does it avail the owner of windows for the effects of possession according to article 1942 of the Civil code, because it is a mere possession at will. From all this it follows that the easement of light with respect to the openings made in one’s own edifice does not consist precisely in the fact of opening them or using them, inasmuch as they may be covered up at any time by the owner of the abutting property, and, as Manresa says in his commentaries on the Civil Code,  \"there is true easement as long as the right to impede its use exists.\" The easement really consists in prohibiting or restraining the adjacent owner from doing anything which may tend to cut off or interrupt the light; in short, it is limited to the obligation of not impeding the light (ne luminibus officiatur). The latter coincides in its effects, from this point of view, with the obligation of refraining from increasing the height of a building (altius non tollendi), which, although it constitutes a special easement, has for its object, at times, the prevention of any interruption of the light enjoyed by the adjacent owner. <br/><br/>It will be readily observed that the owner of the servient estate subject to such an easement is under no obligation whatsoever to allow anything to be done on his tenement, nor to do anything there himself, but is simply restrained from doing anything thereon which may tend to cut off the light from the dominant estate, which he would undoubtedly be entitled to do were it not for the existence of the easement. If, then, the first condition is that which is peculiar to positive easements, and the second condition that which is peculiar to negative easements, according to the definition of article 533 of the Civil Code, it is our opinion that the easement of lights in the case of windows opened in one’s own wall is of a negative character, and, as such, can not be acquired by prescription under article 538 of the Civil Code, except by counting the time of possession from the date on which the owner of the dominant estate may, by a formal act, have prohibited the owner of the servient estate from doing something which it would be lawful for him to do were it not for the easement. <br/><br/>The supreme court of Spain, in its decisions upon this subject, has established these principles by a long line of cases. In its judgment of May 14, 1861, the said court holds that  \"the prescription of the easement of lights does not take place unless there has been some act of opposition on the part of the person attempting to acquire such a right against the person attempting to obstruct its enjoyment.\" \"The easements of light and view,\" says the judgment of March 6, 1875,  \"because they are of a negative character, can not be acquired by a prescriptive title, even if continuous, or although they may have been used for more than twenty-eight years, if the indispensable requisite for prescription is absent, which is the prohibition on the one part, and the consent on the other, of the freedom of the tenement which it is sought to charge with the easement.\" In its judgment of June 13, 1877, it is also held that use does not confer the right to maintain lateral openings or windows in one’s own wall to the prejudice of the owner of the adjacent tenement, who, being entitled to make use of the soil and of the space above it, may, without restriction, build on his line or increase the height of existing buildings, unless he has been\" forbidden to increase the height of his buildings and to thus cut off the light,’’ and such prohibition has been consented to and the time fixed by law subsequently expired. The court also holds that it is error to give the mere existence or use of windows in a wall standing wholly on the land of one proprietor the creative force of a true easement, although they may have existed from time immemorial. Finally, the judgments of the 12th of November, 1889, and the 31st of day, 1890, hold that  \"as this supreme court has decided, openings made in walls standing wholly on the land of one proprietor and which overlook the land of another exist by mere tolerance in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, and can not be acquired by prescription, except by computing the time from the execution of some act of possession which tends to deprive the owner of the tenement affected of the right to build thereon.\" Various other judgments might be cited, but we consider that those above mentioned are sufficient to demonstrate the uniformity of the decisions upon this point. It is true that the supreme court of Spain, in its decisions of February and May 5, 1896, has classified as positive easements of lights which were the object of the suits in which these decisions were rendered in cassation, and from these it might be believed as first glance that the former holdings of the supreme court upon this subject had been overruled. But this is not so, as a matter of fact, inasmuch as there is no conflict between these decisions and the former decisions above cited. <br/><br/>In the first of the suits referred to, the question turned upon two houses which had formerly belonged to the same owner, who established a service of light on one of them for the benefit of the other. These properties were subsequently conveyed to the different persons, but at the time of the separation of the property nothing was said as to the discontinuance of the easement, nor were the windows which constituted the visible sign thereof removed. The new owner of the house subject to the easement endeavored to free it from the incumbrance, notwithstanding the fact that the easement had been in existence for thirty-five years, and alleged that the owner of the dominant estate had not performed any act of opposition which might serve as a starting point for the acquisition of a prescriptive title. The supreme court, in deciding this case, on the 7th of February, 1896, held that the easement in this particular case was positive, because it consisted in the active enjoyment of the light. This doctrine is doubtless based upon article 541 of the Code, which is of the following tenor:  \"The existence of apparent sign of an easement between two tenements, established by the owner of both of them, shall be considered, should be expressed in the deed of conveyance of either of them, or such sign is taken away before the execution of such deed.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The word  \"active\" used in the decision quoted in classifying the particular enjoyment of light referred to therein, presupposes on the part of the owner of the dominant estate a right to such enjoyment arising, in the particular case passed upon by that decision, from the voluntary act of the original owner of the two houses, by which he imposed upon one of them an easement for the benefit of the other. It is well known that easements are established, among other cases, by the will of the owners. (Article 536 of the Code.) It was an act which was, in fact, respected and acquiesced in by the new owner of the servient estate, since he purchased it without making any stipulation against the easement existing thereon, but on the contrary, acquiesced in the continuance of the apparent sign thereof. As is stated in the decision itself,  \"It is a principle of law that upon a division of a tenement among various persons — in the absence of any mention in the contract of a mode of enjoyment different from that to which the former owner was accustomed — such easements as may be necessary for the continuation of such enjoyment are understood to subsist.\" It will be seen, then, that the phrase  \"active enjoyment\" involves an idea directly opposed to the enjoyment\" which is result of a mere tolerance on the part of the adjacent owner, and which, as it is not based upon an absolute, enforceable right, may be considered as of a merely passive character. Therefore, the decision in question is not in conflict with the former rulings of the supreme court of Spain upon the subject, inasmuch as it deals with an easement of light established by the owner of the servient estate, and which continued in force after the estate was sold, in accordance with the special provisions of article 541 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>Nor is the other decision cited, on May 5, 1896, in conflict with the doctrine above laid down, because it refers to windows opened in a party wall, and not in a wall the sole and exclusive property of the owner of the dominant tenement, as in the cases referred to by the other decisions, and as in the case at bar. The reason for the difference of the doctrine in the one and the other case is that no part owner can, without the consent of the other, make in a party wall a window or opening of any kind, as provided by article 580 of the Civil Code. The very fact of making such openings in such a wall might, therefore, be the basis for the acquisition of a prescriptive title without the necessity of any active opposition, because it always presupposes the express or implied consent of the other part owner of the wall, which consent, in turn, implies the voluntary waiver of the right of such part owner to oppose the making of such openings or windows in such a wall. <br/><br/>With respect to the provisions of law 15, title 31, third partida, which the appellant largely relied upon in his oral argument before the court, far from being contrary to it, is entirely in accord with the doctrine of the decisions above referred to. This law provides that  \"if anyone shall open a window in the wall of his neighbor, through which the light enters his house,\" by this sole fact he shall acquire a prescriptive title to the easement of light, if the time fixed in the same law (ten years as to those in the country and twenty years as to absentees) expires without opposition on the part of the owner of the wall; but, with the exception of this case, that is to say, when the windows are not opened in the wall of the neighbor, the law referred to requires as a condition to the commencement of the running of the time for the prescriptive acquisition of the easement, that  \"the neighbor be prohibited from raising his house, and from thereby interrupting the light.\" That is to say, he must be prohibited from exercising his right to build upon his land, and cover the window of the other. This prohibition, if consented to, serves as a starting point for the prescriptive acquisition of the easement. It is also an indispensable requisite, therefore, in accordance with the law of the partidas, above mentioned, that some act of opposition be performed, in order that an easement may be acquired with respect to openings made in one’s own wall. <br/><br/>For a proper understanding of this doctrine, it is well to hold in mind that the Code of the partidas, as well as the Roman law, clearly distinguishes two classes of easements with respect to the lights of houses, as may be seen in law\" of title 31, of the third partida. One of them consists in  \"the right to pierce the wall of one’s neighbor to open a window through which the light may enter one’s house\" (equivalent to the so-called easement of luminum of the Romans); the other is  \"the easement which one house enjoys over another, whereby the latter can not at any time be raised to a greater height than it had at the time the easement was established, to the end that the light be not interrupted.\" (Ne luminibus officiator.) For the prescriptive acquisition of the former the time must begin, as we have seen, from the opening of the window in  the neighbor’s wall. As to the second, the time commences from the date on which he was  \"prevented from raising his house.\" Some of the judgments which establish the doctrine above laid down were rendered by the supreme court of Spain interpreting and applying the above-cited law 15, title 31, partida 3, and therefore they can not in any sense be regarded as antagonistic to the law itself. <br/><br/>The question as to whether the windows of the house of the plaintiff are, or are not, so-called regulation windows, we consider of but little importance in this case, both because the authority of the decisions of the law of the partidas, above cited, refers to all kinds of windows, and not to regulation windows solely, and because the record does not disclose, nor has the appellant even stated, the requirements as to such regulation windows under the law in operation prior to the Civil Code, which he asserts should be applied and on which he relies to demonstrate that he has acquired by prescription the easement in question. With respect to the watershed which, according to the plaintiff, exists over the window in question, the record does not disclose that the same has been destroyed by the defendant. He expressly denies it on page 7 of his brief, and affirms (p. 8) that the tenant of the appellant’s property himself removed it, by reason of the notice served on him; on the other hand, the judgment of the court below contains no findings with respect to this fact, nor does it disclose the former existence of any such watershed. Furthermore, the opinion which we have formed with respect to this matter, in so far as we are able to understand the merits of the case, is that this shed was a mere accessory of the window, apparently having no other purpose than that of protecting it against the inclemency of the weather; this being so, we are of opinion that it should follow the condition of the window itself, in accordance with the legal maxim that the accessory always follows the principal. The appellant contends that the shed should be regarded as a projection within the provisions of article 582 of the Code; but it is sufficient to observe that this article speaks of windows with direct views, balconies, or similar projections, in order to conclude that the article does not refer to such watersheds, which have not the slightest degree of similarity to balconies, nor are they  constructed for the purpose of obtaining the view — this being the subject-matter which this article expressly purports to control — inasmuch as such sheds have rather the effect of limiting the scope of the view than of increasing it. <br/><br/>The fact that the defendant did not cover the windows of the other house adjacent to No. 63 at the time he covered the windows of the appellant, a fact which the latter adduces as proof of the recognition on the part of the former of the prescriptive acquisition of the easement of the light in favor of that house, which, according to his statement, is under precisely the same conditions as the house of the plaintiff, does not necessarily imply, in our opinion, any such recognition, as it might be the result of a mere tolerance on the part of the defendant. Certainly the fact of his tolerating, the use by the owner of that house of such windows, supposing the facts to be as stated, does not carry with it as a result an obligation to exercise the same forbearance with respect to the plaintiff; but whatever may be the legal status of the windows in the house referred to with respect to the house No. 63, we can not pass upon the point, nor can we form suppositions concerning the matter for the purpose of drawing conclusions of any kind therefrom to support our opinion, for the simple reason that it is not a point at issue in this case, and more especially because the defendant not only denied the existence of the alleged easement of light in favor of-the house referred to, but, on the contrary, he affirms that demand has been made that the windows in said house be closed, as may be seen on page 8 of his brief. <br/><br/>The point discussed in this trial being whether the plaintiff has acquired the easement which he seeks to enforce over the house of which the defendant is tenant, it is evident that the provisions of article 585 of the Civil Code can not be involved without taking for granted the very point at issue. This article refers to cases in which, under any title, the right has been acquired to have direct views, balconies, or belvederes over contiguous property. The existence of such a right being the very point at issue, the supposition upon which the article rests is lacking, and it is therefore not in point. <br/><br/>As a result of the opinion above expressed, we hold:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>1. That the easement of light which is the object of this litigation is of a negative character, and therefore pertains to the class which can not be acquired by prescription as provided by article 638 of the Civil Code, except by counting the time of possession from the date on which the owner of the dominant estate has, in a formal manner, forbidden the owner of the servient estate to do an act which could be lawful were it not for the easement. <br/><br/>2. That, in consequence thereof, the plaintiff, not having executed any formal act of opposition to the right of the owner of house No. 63 Calle Rosario (of which the defendant is tenant), to make therein improvements which might obstruct the light of house No. 65 of the same street, the property of the wife of the appellant, at any time prior to the complaint, as found by the court below in the judgment assigned as error, he has not acquired, nor could he acquire by prescription, such easement of light, no matter how long a time might have elapsed since the windows were opened in the wall of the said house No. 65, because the period which the law demands for such prescriptive acquisition could not have commenced to run, the act with which it must necessarily commence not having been performed. <br/><br/>Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court below and condemn the appellant to the payment of all damages caused to the plaintiff, and to the payment of the court of this appeal. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <p>ON MOTION FOR A REHEARING. <br/><br/>The plaintiff asks for a rehearing of the decision of the court of March 12th last upon the ground that the same contains error:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>First, because the decision holds that the window opened in the plaintiff’s own wall and the watershed do not constitute the continuous and apparent easements of prospect, light, and ventilation, or jus projitiendi and jus spillitiendi, this ruling being in opposition to the provisions of laws 12, 14, and 15, title 31, third partida, and articles 530, 532, 533, 537, 538, 582, and 585 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>This allegation is entirely unfounded, inasmuch as the decision of the court contains no declaration as to whether the windows and watershed do or do not constitute continuous and apparent easements, or jus projitiendi and jus spillitiendi. These questions were not drawn into issue by the complaint, and therefore any decision thereon one day or the other would have been mere dicta. What the court did hold was that the easement of light, when it is sought to claim such benefit from a window opened in one’s own wall, as does the appellant with respect to the tenement of the defendant, belongs to the class of negative easements, and that on that account the time of possession for prescriptive acquisition of the title thereto must be counted, not from the time of the opening of the windows, but from the time at which the owner thereof has executed some act of opposition tending to deprive the owner of the servient tenement of his right, under the law, to build upon it to such height as he might see fit in the legitimate use of his rights of ownership. With respect to the watershed, the court held that the shed in question in the case is not included within the class of projections referred to in article 582 of the Civil Code, and certain it is that neither this article nor and of the other provisions of law cited by the appellant in his motion papers establish any doctrine contrary to that laid down in the decision, either with regard to the watershed or with respect to the windows. It is not necessary to say anything further upon this point. It is sufficient to read the text of the laws cited to reach the conclusion that the assertion made by the appellant in his motion papers is entirely gratuitous. <br/><br/>Article 582 provides that windows with direct views, balconies, or other similar projections opening upon the tenement of one’s neighbor are not permissible unless there are two meters distance between the wall in which such openings are constructed and the adjacent tenement. From this the appellant draws the conclusion that he who opens windows in his own wall without respecting the distance mentioned does not exercise an act of ownership, as stated in the decision, inasmuch as he violates an express provision of the law. <br/><br/>The conclusion reached is evidently false. The appellant confounds the facts with the law — an act of ownership with the right of ownership. The owner of a thing does not cease to be such owner because in his manner of use or enjoyment thereof he violates some provision of law. The acts which he performs, in our opinion, even if abusive or contrary to law, are in a strict sense acts of ownership, acts in the exercise of dominion, because this character is not derived from a greater or less degree of compliance with the provisions of law, but from the existence of the status of owner on the part of the person who exercises such acts. In order that the act performed by the owner of a wall in opening windows therein be a true act of ownership it is a matter of indifference whether or not the distance prescribed by article 582 of the Code has been respected, although, considered from a legal point of view, it might be an illegal act, as not complying with the conditions imposed by law. <br/><br/>The doctrine laid down by law 13, title 31, partida 3, cited in the decision, to the effect that  \"a man should not use that which belongs to him as if it were a service only, but as his own property\" is of general application, and does not refer to the easements which a property owner may establish for the benefit of his heirs, as is erroneously believed by the <em>Appellant</em>. The very same law provides that easements which  \"a man imposes upon his house must be for the benefit of the tenement or thing of another, and not that of his own tenement;\" and this is because things are of service to their owner by reason of dominion, and not in the exercise of a right of easement.  \"Res sua,\" says a legal maxim,  \"nemini jure servitutis servit.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The provision of article 1942 of the Civil Code to the effect that acts which are merely tolerated produce no effect with respect to possession is applicable as much to the prescription of real rights as to the prescription of the fee, it being a glaring and self-evident error to affirm the contrary, as does the appellant in his motion papers. Possession is the fundamental basis of the prescription. Without it no kind of prescription is possible, not even the extraordinary. Consequently, if acts of mere tolerance produce no effect with respect to possession, as that article provides, in conformity with article 114 of the same Code, it is evident that they can produce no effect with respect to prescription, whether ordinary or extraordinary. This is true whether the prescriptive acquisition be of a fee or of real rights, for the same reason holds in one and the other case; that is, that there has been no true possession in the legal sense of the word. Hence, it is because the use of windows in one s own wall is the result of a mere tolerance that the supreme court of Spain, in its judgment of June 13, 1877, has held that such user lacks the creative force of a true easement, although continued from time immemorial. The citation of article 1959 of the Civil Code and of law 21, title 29, partida 3, made by the petitioner, is therefore not in point, because both of these provisions of law, which refer to the extraordinary period of prescription, presuppose possession as a necessary requisite, even if without either just title or good faith. <br/><br/>The second error assigned is that in the decision the court holds that the gravamina constituted by the window and the projection are negative easements, against the provisions of article 533, which define them as positive, which definition, he adds, is supported by the judgments of the supreme court of Spain of February 7 and May 5, 1896, cited in paragraph 1\" of the said decision, which judgments declare that the easement resting from a window is positive. <br/><br/>It is not true that article 533 of the Civil Code says that the easement of light is positive, because it does nothing more than give in general terms the definition of positive easements and negative easements, without attempting to specify whether the easement of lights pertains to the first or to the second class. We have declared that the easement is negative, having in mind this very definition of the Code and the doctrine established by the judgments of the supreme court of Spain which have been cited in our opinion. The interpretation which the appellant attempts to give the article of the Civil Code cited is evidently erroneous, and, consequently, the citation made by him in support of his contention is not in point. <br/><br/>Our opinion of the true extent and meaning of the judgments of the supreme court of Spain of February 7 and May 5, 1896, has been already sufficiently explained, and it is therefore unnecessary to go into the subject again here. We refer to our decision with respect to what was said therein upon this subject. <br/><br/>The decision of the court does not contain the declaration, as gratuitously assumed by the appellant, that the easement resulting from a projection is of a negative character; nor, in fact, had we any occasion to make such a declaration, in view of the nature of the issues raised and discussed during the trial. What we did, indeed, hold was that the watershed mentioned in the complaint, the purpose of which was simply to protect the window in question from sun and rain, was a mere accessory to that window, and that in no case could it be considered as a projection within the provisions of article 582 of the Civil Code, as so erroneously contented by the appellant at the trial. The find nothing in his motion papers which can in any way weaken this holding. <br/><br/>The third error assigned is that the court holds that the easement of light, as negative, can not be acquired by prescription except by counting the period of possession from the time at which the owner of the servient tenement has been prohibited from making improvements which might interfere with said easement, contrary to the provisions of law 14, title 31, partida 3, and articles 538 and 585 of the Civil Code, which establish the contrary. <br/><br/>This assertion is entirely destitute of foundation, inasmuch as neither in the law of the partidas nor in the articles of the Civil Code mentioned is to be found the doctrine which the appellant arbitrarily seeks to deduce from them. It is sufficient to read the text to reach the conclusion that the assertion is wholly gratuitous. <br/><br/>The fourth error assigned is that the court holds that the watershed, as being an accessory of the window, can not in itself constitute an easement, this being contrary to the provisions of articles 582 and 585 of the Civil Code, and law 2, title 31, partida 3, which do not make any such distinction. <br/><br/>Neither of the laws cited speaks expressly of watersheds. We have held that article 582 refers solely to windows, balconies, and other similar projections, and that the watershed in question does not pertain to this class of projections, our holding being based upon the reasons given in our decision. The appellant advances no argument worthy of serious consideration, and therefore we continue to believe that our opinion in this matter is strictly in accordance with the law. <br/><br/>The appellant has attached to his motion for a rehearing two judgments, one rendered by the Royal Audiencia of Manila September 6, 1877, and the other by the supreme court of Spain on the 22d of February, 1892, and we think it well to say a few words concerning them. <br/><br/>In the opinion of the appellant these judgments support the theory contended for by him at the trial, that the easement of lights is positive and not negative. His error in so believing is evident, inasmuch as neither of the judgments referred to establishes any such doctrine. On the contrary, it appears clear, from the first of these judgments, that the easement referred to is negative in the opinion to the court which rendered it. This appears from the eighth conclusion of law therein, which is literally as follows:  \"From the evidence introduced by the defendant, and even from the testimony of witnesses of the plaintiff, it has been proven that since 1828 the house in question has suffered no change or alteration in its roof, which projects over Cosio’s lot, which constitutes the active opposition necessary in order to acquire by prescription the right to the light.\" It will be seen, then, that the latter part of the preceding transcript of the conclusion of law lays down precisely the same doctrine as that expressed in our decision — that active opposition is a necessary condition for prescriptive acquisition of an easement of light. And this also demonstrates conclusively that the court which rendered the judgment referred to considered the easement to be negative, inasmuch as positive easements do not require any active opposition as a basis for their prescriptive acquisition, such an act being solely necessary to the prescription of negative easements. <br/><br/>It would appear, judging from his allegations as a whole, that the appellant confuses positive easements with continuous easements, and the judgment referred to, in fact, declares in its fourth conclusion of law that the easement of light is continuous. If this were really so the error of the appellant would be manifest, because continuity is not a quality exclusively peculiar to positive easements; there are negative easements which are also continuous. Hence it is that the Civil Code, after classifying easements, in article 532, as continuous and discontinuous, classifies them also as positive and negative (art. 533), thus giving to understand that this latter classification depends upon other characteristics entirely distinct from the continuity or discontinuity of easements. If all continuous easements were positive and all discontinuous easements were negative, then the express division of easements into positive and negative made by the Code, after establishing the division of the same as continuous or discontinuous, would be entirely unnecessary, as they would be entirely merged or included in the latter classification. It is sufficient to read the text of the Code to understand beyond the possibility of a doubt that a negative easement may be continuous, and that a positive easement may be discontinuous, according to the special nature of each one. <br/><br/>With respect to the second judgment — the judgment of the supreme court of Spain of February 22, 1892 — it is certainly difficult to understand how the appellant could have imagined that he had found therein the slightest ground for his contention, inasmuch as it laws down no doctrine which relates even by inference to the subject of easements, and simply holds, in the first of only two paragraphs in which its conclusions are contained, that  \"judgments should be clear, precise, and responsive to the complaint and the issues properly raised at the trial;  \"and in the second, that  \"the judgment appealed was contradictory as to the questions it decides, because it makes certain declarations favorable to some of the contentions in the plaintiff’s complaint and then gives judgment for the defendant, without making any distinction.\" It was for this reason alone, and for no other, that the judgment appealed as reversed and annulled. In the judgment rendered by the same supreme court upon the merits of the case, as a result of this decision in cassation, no other doctrine is laid down than that  \"the judgment must be that the defendant comply with those claims advanced by the complaint to which he has consented, and that he must be discharged as to those allegations which have been denied by him and which have not been proved by the plaintiff.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>‘There is not one word in these judgments which says that the easement of lights is positive, nor that a watershed constitutes a true projection within the meaning attached to this word in article 582 of the Civil Code, as has been vainly contended by the appellant in the trial. <br/><br/>Therefore the appellant’s motion for a rehearing of the decision of March 12, 1903, is denied. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres and McDonough, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </p><p>ON MOTION FOR WRIT OF ERROR TO REMOVE THE CASE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. <br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J. </em>:</p></div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff has brought an action for the recovery from the defendants, heirs of the late Don Ciriaco Demonteverde, of one-half of a sugar estate and the stock thereon, which he claims to have purchased from the said Don Ciriaco Demonteverde. In support of his contention as to the law of the case he attached to the complaint a public instrument which appears to have been executed by himself and Demonteverde, February 3, 1883, in which, according to the plaintiff, a stipulation is made for a contract of partnership for the operation of the said estate, and, furthermore, a community of ownership is established with respect to the estate in favor of the two parties to this instrument. It does not appear that this instrument has been recorded in the registry of property. <br/><br/>Service of the complaint having been had on the defendants, Doña Maria Pascuala Dolor raised an incidental issue as a previous question, praying that the instrument referred to be ruled out of evidence on the ground that it had not been recorded in the registry of property, and that it be returned to the plaintiff without leaving in the record any transcript or copy thereof or extract therefrom, resting this contention upon article 389 of the Mortgage Law. This motion was granted by the judge by order of the 24th of March, 1898, against which the plaintiff appeals. <br/><br/>The article cited is literally as follows:  \"From the time this law goes into operation the ordinary and special courts and the Government offices will not admit any document or instrument by which rights subject to inscription according to this law are constituted, transmitted, acknowledged, modified, or extinguished, unless recorded in the register, if the object of the presentation of such document is to enforce, to the prejudice of a third person, a right which should have been recorded.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In view of the latter part of this article, the question has been raised in this incidental issue whether the defendants, as heirs of Don Ciriaco Demonteverde, can and should be regarded as third persons for the purposes of the Mortgage Law, with respect to the contract executed by Demonteverde and evidenced by the instrument abovementioned. <br/><br/>The Mortgage Law itself, in article 27, gives the definition of a third person, which is,  \"he who has not taken part in the act or contract recorded.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>According to this the parties to a contract are not third persons; consequently, Demonteverde was not a third person with respect to the contract entered into by him and evidenced by the instrument in question. He not being such a third person, neither can his heirs be so regarded, nor should they be so regarded with respect to the same contract, because they are only the juridical continuation of his personality, they having been subrogated, by virtue of the right of succession, to all his rights and obligations, in accordance with provisions of article 661 of the Civil Code. <br/><br/>This doctrine, which is a mere consequence of the general principles of law, has received express sanction in the decisions of the supreme court of Spain. In its judgment of the 27th of January, 1881, the latter held that acts, both in court and out, consented to by the person who lawfully took part therein, are effective with respect to the heirs or successors of such parties, who are not to be regarded as third persons for this purpose; and in its judgment of the 28th of January, 1892; it was decided by the same court that heirs are nothing more than the continuation of the legal personality of their decedent and can not be considered in any degree as third persons within the meaning of article 27 of the Mortgage Law. <br/><br/>The defendants, therefore, are not third persons with respect to the contract entered into by their decedent, Don Ciriaco Demonteverde, in the instrument of February 3, 1883, and they therefore can not avail themselves of the prohibition contained in article 389 of the Mortgage Law for the purpose of opposing the admission of this instrument as evidence in the case, because not recorded in the registry of property. This prohibition was established solely and exclusively in favor of those who, within the meaning of that law, are third persons. Were it otherwise, the position of the defendants would be superior to that of the person from whom they derived their rights, because he, not being a third person, could not set up such an exception. This would certainly be most illogical from a legal point of view, in view of the fact that the heir is, as above stated, a mere continuation of the civil personality of his decedent. <br/><br/>The defendants not being third persons, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the instrument referred to is or is not subject to inscription in accordance with article of the Mortgage Law, because, at all events, and however this may be, the mere failure to record the instrument in the registry of property can not be a bar to its admission as evidence in this case, as the action is not brought against a third person in the sense of this word as used in the law referred to. <br/><br/>Consequently we reverse and annul the order of the court below, overruling the motion made on behalf of Doña Maria Pascuala Dolor, without special condemnation as to the costs of either instance.

He appeals from this judgment. <br/><br/>The circumstance that the defendant was a domestic at the time of the commission of the offense was applied in raising the penalty to the next higher degree than that prescribed in articles 517, and 518 of the Penal Code. The evidence shows that Don Ramon Panlilio was at the time of the commission of the offense living with his aunt, Doña Maria Santos, as one of the family, the defendant then being in the employ of Señora Santos. It appears from the testimony of Don Ramon Panlilio that in the month of August of last year he made a professional call and was driven by the defendant in a carromata to attend it. That on returning home he forgot the case of instruments, leaving, it upon the seat of the carromata; that about an hour afterwards he remembered he had left the case of instruments in the carromata and called to the cochero to bring it to him; that the cochero had gone off and that the case of instruments had disappeared. The case of instruments was worth 200 pesos. He also noticed that the lamps were missing from the carromata, which were of the value of 60 pesos. <br/><br/>The defendant left Bacolor for Manila and. did not return for several months. <br/><br/>Amado Gutierrez, a witness for the prosecution, testified that he was acquainted with the defendant, having known him as an employee of Doña Maria Santos and in the employ of his sister, Doña Maria Rodriguez; that some time about midday on a day in August the defendant passed in front of witness’s house carrying a case of instruments which he recognized as belonging to D. Ramon Panlilio; that he paid no further attention to it because he knew that the defendant was the cochero of Panlilio. That the street in which the defendant was seen by the witness was the road which leads to Guagua where the steamer is taken; that the defendant carried the case of instruments in his right hand; that the defendant was traveling on foot and alone. <br/><br/>Andres Panlilio testified that while in a drug store he saw the defendant pass carrying two lamps in his hand and a case of surgical instruments. He heard a few days afterwards of the loss of the instruments by Señor Panlilio, and then he told that he had seen the cochero pass carrying the lamps and the case. <br/><br/>The prosecution introduced other testimony in the case tending to show the loss of the case of instruments and the disappearance of the defendant at the time. <br/><br/>The evidence in support of the defense was confined to the proof of an alibi. <br/><br/>There can be no doubt that the defendant, Lescano, was at the date of the loss of the articles mentioned in the employ of Doña Maria Santos, and that he disappeared at the time the articles were missing,. It will be unnecessary therefore to consider further the character of the testimony in support of the alibi. <br/><br/>Objections are made by the attorney for the defense to the answers of certain witnesses in the case to the effect that they supposed that the defendant was guilty of the crime, and to other statements made by them of a hearsay character considered by the court below. <br/><br/>The testimony of the witnesses Ramon Panlilio, Amado Gutierrez, and Andres Panlilio is sufficient to establish the guilt of the defendant without regard to the evidence to which objection is made. The admission of this evidence as harmless error. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed, and the costs of appeal is adjudged against the defendant. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The offense of which the defendant has been convicted is that termed abusos deshonestos, defined in article 439 of the Code. There appears to be no dispute as to the facts. The prosecuting witness, Saturnina Emiterio, owed the defendant, who was the president of the pueblo, a peso. The defendant sent several policemen to her house to arrest her. They brought her to the defendant’s house, where, after beating her with a stick, the defendant compelled her to take off all her clothes and dance before himself and many other persons. Further details of what occurred are related by the witnesses, but it is not necessary to state them. <br/><br/>It is claimed by counsel for the defendant that these facts do not show the commission of the offense of abusos deshonestos, because the defendant was actuated in what he did not by libidinous motives but by the desire to punish the prosecuting witness for not returning the peso. <br/><br/>We need not determine the abstract question whether in a case where the sole motive of acts such as those under consideration appeared to be anger, curiosity, or the like, this particular crime of abusos deshonestos could be said to be committed. We can not so interpret the facts of the present case. It appears to have been assumed by the court below in its judgment that the defendant s purpose was to take revenge upon the prosecuting witness for her failure to pay him, and that may doubtless have been one motive, and it may even be admitted that it was the dominating motive of his conduct. Still we can not believe that there was no admixture of lasciviousness in the thoughts and purposes of a man who could devise such a method as this defendant did to exact satisfaction from a an for the nonpayment of a debt. And we are therefore of opinion that, even if the facts are to viewed from a subjective as well as an objective standpoint, the offense of abusos deshonestos may properly be predicated upon them. <br/><br/>It is further claimed be counsel for the defendant that the fact that the complaint was not sworn to by the prosecuting witness vitiates all the proceedings. Without considering what might be the consequences of such a defect in the complaint if neither cured nor waived, it is sufficient to say that here the defect was both cured and waived — waived because no objection was taken at the trial, and cured because the complaint, having been adopted by the provincial fiscal in a writing signed by him and filed in court, may be rewarded for all material purposes as an information under General Orders, No. 58, section 6. <br/><br/>The judgment is affirmed with costs, and the cause will be returned to the court below for the execution of such judgment.

On January 3, 1902, he took the property to the place where the drawing was to be made. The tickets were placed in a box, and the last one drawn, which was the defendant’s, was the winning one. Immediately after the drawing it was discovered that a ticket owned by Irwin had not been placed in the box. A discussion arose among the twenty or forty ticket holders present as to what should be done, some demanding that there should be another drawing. The defendant in the meantime settled with Irwin by giving him a half interest in the property, got into the calesa, remained there five minutes or more, and then drove away. It appears that the plaintiff did not, after the drawing, expressly give his consent to this act of the defendant. But it is also proved to our satisfaction that the plaintiff was there at the time and made no objection to it. <br/><br/>The defendant refused to return the property, and the plaintiff brought this action to recover it. He bases his right on the proposition that he was the owner of it, that the defendant took it from him against his will and has refused to return it. <br/><br/>1. The case turns, in our opinion, upon the question whether these effects were voluntarily delivered by the plaintiff or not. The plaintiff had received for them $210. The only purpose of the drawing was to determine which one of the ticket holders was the owner. The plaintiff brought the property to the drawing for the purpose of allowing the owner to take it away when that owner should have been designated. As the plaintiff himself says in his brief, it was  \"waiting\" outside. After the winner was known no affirmative action on the part of the plaintiff -was necessary in order to place him, the winner, in possession. The property was there for the express purpose of being taken away by him. The plaintiff saw it so taken away and made no objection. <br/><br/>To our minds the case does not differ from one in which two persons playing a prohibited game place the stakes on the table. At the end of the game the winner takes up the money and goes away with it. It is true that after the game there is no actual delivery of the money by the loser to the winner, nor is there any express consent that the latter may take it away, but it can not in such a case be doubted that the loser has voluntarily paid what he has lost. He expressed his consent that the winner might take the money when he placed it on the table and agreed that it should abide the result of the game. <br/><br/>We should have had a different question had the plaintiff not taken the property to the place for the drawing. So the case would have been different had the plaintiff after the drawing objected to its removal by the defendant. In our opinion the plaintiff voluntarily delivered the property to the defendant, and he can not, therefore, recover. <br/><br/>It makes no difference whether the transaction was or was not illegal. If, as respects the plaintiff, the raffle was illegal because prohibited by the ordinance of the city of Manila of December 5, 1901, and it can be said that he lost the property by a prohibited game of chance, then article 1798 of the Civil Code prevents him from recovering it, for he voluntarily paid what he lost. <br/><br/>If, on the contrary, it should be said that, while the defendant won the horse by a prohibited game, yet the plaintiff, having been paid $210 for it, did not lose it by such a game, we have an ordinary sale of personal property, the payment of the price, and the delivery of the article to the purchaser. <br/><br/>2. The defendant, against the objection and exception of the plaintiff, was allowed to prove the facts connected with the raffle. This ruling was correct. When an action is brought to recover property it is competent for the defendant to show, if he can, that he won the property from the plaintiff by gambling. and that the plaintiff voluntarily delivered it to him. Such evidence defeats a recovery. (Art. 1798, Civil Code.) <br/><br/>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the <em>Appellant</em>. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">About midday on the 12th of November, 1901, Evaristo Perez, a member of the municipal police of San Isidro, accompanied by Valentin Ramos, a young man 15 or 16 years of age, was going through Cabalantian, of the town of Jaen, with an official letter which he was taking from San Isidro to Jaen. They were met at this point of the road by two men, who subsequently proved to be Juan Feria and Dionisio Velasquez. Feria suddenly seized the policeman, Perez, while the other endeavored to seize the boy, Ramos. The latter immediately fled, and although pursued by Velasquez was not overtaken by him. Velasquez then returned to the place where his companion, Feria, was holding Perez, and attacked the latter with a long bolo, inflicting upon him a wound in the neck and two in the back. As a result of these wounds Perez fell senseless to the ground, mortally wounded, and thereupon the defendants, Feria and Velasquez, possessed themselves of the Colt revolver carried by Perez, together with the sheath and belt. <br/><br/>The lad, Ramos, after making his escape from Velasquez, at once proceeded to the municipal presidencia of San Isidro, where he reported the occurrence. Several of the municipal officers immediately went to the place in question, and found the policeman, Evaristo Perez, in so serious a condition that he expired on the road before arriving at the town. From an examination of the body of Perez made by the municipal physician it was found that he had received a severe wound on the upper left side of the neck, and that two of the larger arteries had been severed. Another penetrating wound was found on the left side, which pierced the thorax and wounded the lung. The third wound had penetrated the back on the right side. The first wound was inflicted with a bolo and the latter two with a dagger. The burial certificate of the deceased is in the record (p. 15). <br/><br/>The facts stated, charged in the complaint as murder, constitute this crime as defined and punished by article 103 of the Penal Code. When the policeman, Evaristo Perez, was attacked by one of the defendants, he was being held by the other, who prevented him from defending himself or making his escape, and therefore the deceased was killed treacherously, the defendants having availed themselves of a method which directly and specially tended to insure the consummation of their common criminal purpose without risk to themselves arising from any defense which their victim might have made. One of the defendants succeeded in inflicting upon the deceased three wounds, all of them mortal, without danger to himself, as his companion was preventing any act of defense on the part of the victim, or even his flight. <br/><br/>The two defendants, Feria and Velasquez, pleaded not guilty to the charge. In their testimony at the trial they stated that by orders of three men whom they met at the place where the murder occurred they seized the policeman, Evaristo Perez; that then these three men, called Apolonio, Eustaquio, and Anacleto, attacked and killed the deceased. These assertions, however, are unsupported by evidence and contradict former statements made by the accused before the justice of the peace of Jaen, who conducted the preliminary investigation. In this investigation, and in the presence of seven witnesses, both the accused confessed to their respective participation in the crime, although Feria alleged that he had simply held Perez and that it was Velasquez who wounded him, while Velasquez on the other-hand asserted that the contrary was the case. <br/><br/>The testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is corroborated by the testimony of the principal witness, Valentin Ramos. Ramos was an eyewitness to the beginning of the aggression, and both in the preliminary investigation and at the trial unhesitatingly identified Feria as the man who seized and held the deceased and Velasquez as the man who had pursued him. This witness had given the description of each one of the defendants before their arrest. It is therefore to be believed that the statements made by the defendants in the presence of the witnesses of the prosecution were true as alleged by these witnesses. Their subsequent statements can not prevail to overcome their former confession. The statement made by Feria that they testified under coercion can not be believed, as there is no evidence in support of it. Furthermore, no proof exists as to the truth of the subsequent statement that Perez was killed by three other men unknown. <br/><br/>The guilt of the defendants Feria and Velasquez as the authors, by direct participation, of the murder of Evaristo Perez is unquestionable. Apart from their confession in the justice’s court of Jaen, which concurs with the testimony of the eyewitness, Valentin Ramos, the testimony of the accused themselves at the trial plainly demonstrates their direct participation in the violent and treacherous killing of the policeman, Perez. The record discloses not the slightest evidence that any other persons participated in the commission of the crime. Another fact to be considered is that the Colt revolver which the deceased was carrying was subsequently found in the possession of the defendant Francisco Donato, who received it from Velasquez, by whom this weapon was taken. In the commission of the crime no generic extenuating or aggravating circumstance is present. It was not sufficiently proven at the trial that the place where Perez was attacked was unpopulated, or that it was purposely selected for the execution of the crime. Neither does it appear that the long bolo taken from one of the defendants was a prohibited weapon, or that this bolo was really the instrument by which the crime was committed. Consequently the only circumstance which can be considered is the qualifying circumstance of treachery (alevosia), which determines the classification and legal character of the crime committed. The fact that the deceased was at that time provided with a revolver is not an obstacle to the consideration of the concurrence of the circumstance of treachery (alevosia), as it does not appear from the record that he was able to make use of this weapon, or that he defended himself with it, but on the contrary, it was fully demonstrated that by reason of the suddenness of the attack the deceased was from the beginning absolutely prevented from defending himself or from making an escape. <br/><br/>The taking of the revolver which the deceased was carrying in his belt possibly constitutes the crime of theft, as it was effected at a time when its possessor was unconscious and in a dying condition. But this has not been made the subject of the information and therefore can not be passed upon in this decision. nor can we determine the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant Francisco Donato, acquitted by a judgment which, as to him, has become final. <br/><br/>By virtue, therefore, of the reasons above stated, the penalty prescribed by article 403 of the Penal Code should be inflicted in its medium degree, and we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed and that each one of the defendants, Juan Feria and Dionisio Velasquez, should be condemned to the penalty of life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) with the accessories of civil interdiction and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during their lifetime. Should they be pardoned as to the principal penalty they shall continue to suffer the penalties of perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during their respective lives, unless these accessories shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon of the principal penalty. They are also condemned to pay, jointly and severally, an indemnity of 2,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, Perez, and to the payment each of one-half of the costs of this instance. All other rulings of the judgment appealed, with respect to the accused, the costs of the first instance, and the confiscation and disposal of the weapons, are affirmed.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendants, Manuel Navarro, Julio Alarcon, and Adriano Labrador, were convicted in the Court of First Instance of Bataan, of robo, under No. 5 of article 503 of the Code, and have appealed. <br/><br/>The case of prosecution rests principally upon the testimony of two witnesses, Narcisa Pangalinan, who is the wife of Tomas Bautista, and their son, Francisco Bautista, 10 y ears of age. Narcisa Pangalinan testifies, in substance, that one Sunday evening in July, 1902, the defendants Navarro and Labrador entered her house in the pueblo of Orion, Bataan, maltreated and intimidated her husband and herself, and compelled her to open a trunk where she had in a tampipe 150 pesos in silver, the accumulated savings of six years, which Navarro seized and carried off. She further testifies that the defendant Alarcon was with Navarro and Labrador, though he did not enter the house, but stated outside while the other two committed the robbery. She states that the defendants took her husband with them when they left the house, but that he returned the same night accompanied by a policeman. <br/><br/>Francisco says that on the night in question he came home from fishing and found Labrador and Alarcon on the stairs; that they prevented him from going into the house, and that Labrador searched his pockets and took from him half a real. He also states that he saw Navarro going off with the tampipe. And in other important details he confirms the testimony of his mother. <br/><br/>Tomas Bautista was unable to be present at the trial on account of sickness, and did not testify. <br/><br/>One rather singular circumstance was developed by the evidence for the defense, namely, that when Tomas Bautista and some others went to the concejal of the barrio, apparently on the very night of the robbery, to report what had occurred, the defendant Navarro went with them. This fact, however, standing by itself, falls far short of raising a reasonable doubt in our minds as to Navarro’s guilt. He may have had an idea that by being among the first to denounce the crime he could in some manner exonerate himself from responsibility for his share in it. There is no other evidence tending to exculpate either Navarro or the other defendants, except some very slight proof of alibi as to Labrador. We believe the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution, and are of opinion that the defendants were properly convicted. No aggravating or extenuating circumstances were appreciated by the court below, but the penalty was nevertheless applied in the maximum grade. We appreciate as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the crime was committed at night. (Art. 10, No. 15.)

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the night of July 9, 1902, while Juana Aguinaldo was going up the stairway of her house in the town of San Mateo, followed by her husband, Guillermo Villanueva, the latter, impelled by the passion of jealousy, fired at his wife with a revolver which he, in his capacity as a member of the police force, was carrying in his belt. The shot was fired at a distance of some three yards. The bullet struck the woman in the back and went through her body. The bullet entered between the sixth and seventh ribs on the right side, near the omoplate and the lung, ranging upward, the point of egress being near the nipple of the right breast. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the wound, which, according to the physician who examined her, might well have been mortal, the judgment appealed stated that on the 7th of August the woman was still alive, and that the wound received by her was healing. <br/><br/>These facts, fully established by the evidence, constitute the crime of frustrated parricide, defined and punished in article 402 in connection with articles 3 and 407 of the Penal Code. The defendant, when aiming and discharging his revolver at his wife’s hack, performed all the acts which necessarily and ordinarily would produce the violent death of the victim. The fact that she did not die at once or a few days after receiving the wound was due to causes independent of the defendant’s will. Upon his part he doubtless fully intended to kill the victim. He made use of a deadly weapon, and in the commission of the offense availed himself of means which directly and specially tended to insure the consummation of the crime without and risk to himself which might arise from an attempt at defense on the part of his victim, who, as she looked back, attracted by the noise of the weapon, received the shot in her back. <br/><br/>The accused, upon being arraigned on the complaint, stated that he had done the act charged, but that he did not regard himself as guilty of a crime. He stated in his defense that the suspicion that his wife was unfaithful to him had made him jealous and that on the night in question he had gone to look for her in the house of one Captain Lucas, knowing that his wife was there at that time. Upon his asking for his wife, Lucas’s wife told him that she was not there, but a few moments afterwards the defendant, lying in wait near the house, saw her emerge from it. The answers she gave to his questions and her embarrassed manner led him to the conclusion, in connection with other information in his possession concerning her conduct, that his suspicion was not unfounded. He then took her home, and upon arriving there saw an old woman called Pilar Pineda, the one who had taken his wife to the house of Lucas, in the act of packing up some clothes, which he supposed belonged to his wife. At this, overcome by his jealousy, he fired at his wife with the revolver he was carrying. <br/><br/>Until the contrary is proven the act of wounding his wife in the back must be regarded as voluntary, and therefore intentional, and so the accused himself testifies in his statements as a witness for the defense. The record does not disclose that the act was committed without intent to harm the complainant, who still lives notwithstanding the gravity of the wound received, and her recovery, if not due to chance, must be attributed to the medical attention which she received shortly after the wound. In other words, her recovery was due to causes independent of the will of the aggressor. <br/><br/>The facts in the ease fall within the definition of the crime of frustrated parricide, as above stated, owing to the relationship between the complainant and the defendant. This circumstance and the fact that the woman is still living and on the way to recovery make it necessary to classify the crime, not as frustrated homicide or murder, but as frustrated parricide inasmuch as it appears from the record to be fully proven that the defendant performed all the acts the natural tendency of which was to produce the death of his wife. The fact that he availed himself of a deadly weapon, that he discharged it at a distance of three yards, at which range such projectiles have a , great penetrating and destructive force, that he aimed the shot at the part of his victims body in which a wound was most likely to deprive her of life, and that he wounded her in the back without her having received the slightest intimation of the commencement of an are aggression, are all details which demonstrate the most complete intention to kill, and if this purpose was not accomplished it was due to facts completed independent of the will of the accused, and wholly foreign to his criminal intent. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime the concurrence of the mitigating circumstances No. 7 of article 9 of the Code must be considered, to wit, the fact that the accused acted upon the impulse of the passion of jealousy which doubtless at the time of the commission of the crime had deprived him of reason and judgment. This circumstance is offset in its favorable effect by the concurrence of the circumstance of treachery (alevosia), No. 2 of article 10 of the Code. This circumstance in the case of a frustrated parricide is not to be regarded as a specific qualifying circumstance, but only as an ordinary generic circumstance, as the crime in question is undoubtedly graver than that of frustrated murder. <br/><br/>With respect to the adequate penalty, the court, in consideration of the circumstances of the case and of the fact that this crime was evidently due to passion, considers it proper to make use of the authority conferred by article 407 of the Penal Code, imposing upon the accused the penalty inferior by one degree to that of cadena temporal, to wit, that of presidio mayor in its medium degree. <br/><br/>We are therefore of the opinion that the judgment appealed should be reversed, and the defendant, Guillermo Villanueva, condemned to the penalty of eight years and one day of presidio mayor, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for a term equal to that of the principal penalty, to run from the expiration of the principal penalty, to the payment to the complainant, Juana Aguinaldo, of an indemnification of 600 Mexican pesos, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency (as provided by art. 51 of the Code), and to pay the costs of both instances.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It is a fact, fully proven-in the present case, that on the afternoon of July 11, 1902, Felix Manalang, a member of the Constabulary forces stationed in the Province of Pampanga, went with two companions to the house of Tomas Lacsamana, situated in Bacolor, in search of a revolver. Lacsamana denied that he had such a weapon in his possession. He was thereupon seized and stretched on the ground and tortured by being compelled to swallow water, which was forced into him through a piece of cane placed in his mouth. In the course of the proceedings his assailants broke one of his teeth. He was then taken to one of the stations in the town of Santa Rita, where he was kept until the night of the 12th following. On this date the defendant obtained from Ines Garcia, the wife of Lacsamana, the delivery of the sum of 15 pesos, which Eugenio Tayo, by order of the accused, demanded from Lacsamana’s wife as a condition of his liberation. She was told that if she did not pay the sum of money it would go hard with her husband. This sum, which Felipe Garcia loaned Lacsamana’s wife, having been received by the accused, one of his companions, Felix Alejo, went to the station and told Lacsamana that he might go, which he did. The delivery of the money to Manalang, on the night of July 12, 1902, was witnessed by the wife of the complainant, by Eugenio Tayo, and by Catalino Lacsamana. Pedro de Jesus, member of the municipal council for the barrio of Potrero, reported these facts to the municipal president of the town, who, in turn, reported them to the provincial fiscal, and the latter thereupon filed the information upon which this case is prosecuted. <br/><br/>These facts, which are fully proven by the evidence, constitute the offense defined and punished by section 19 of Act No. 175, passed July 18, 1901. The defendant, a member of the Constabulary, by means of the persecution, ill treatment, and arrest of Tomas Lacsamana obtained the sum of 15 pesos, which the said accused converted to his own use, holding the complainant in his custody until this sum was paid, thereby committing the crime defined and punished by the said law. <br/><br/>The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge, but, notwithstanding his denial and exculpative allegations, which are entirely unsupported by evidence, the record sufflciently discloses his guilt. The fact that the complainant was ill treated and tortNred by being compelled to swallow a considerable quantity of water through a bamboo thrust into his mouth, and in which proceeding one of his teeth was broken; that Tomas Lacsamana was unlawfully imprisoned for more than twenty-four hours in a barrio police station without having been taken before any proper authority; that the defendant demanded the sum of 15 pesos from the wife of the complainant as a condition to his release and did not liberate him until the money was paid, are facts which are fully established by the evidence in the case. It follows, consequently, that the defendant, Felix Manalang, is the author, by direct participation, of the crime prosecuted, and that he has incurred the penalty prescribed by section 19 of Act No. 175, above referred to. <br/><br/>The counsel for the defendant contends that the information was defective by reason of its failure to state that the accused at the time of the commission of the offense was an officer or member of the constabulary forces, this being essential for the existence of the crime prosecuted. <br/><br/>This objection is unavailing, as no exception was taken to this defect by counsel for the defendant in the court below, in which it might have been successfully raised by demurrer. Furthermore, the objection is not well taken, because the defendant was arrested, appeared before the judge, and was present throughout the tria~, and even testified in his own behalf as a member of the Constabulary, without having denied his character as such, or making any objection to being so considered and prosecuted. Therefore such a defect does not vitiate the proceedings, nor has it prejudiced any essential right of the defendant. For these reasons this objection, raised ill the appellate court, does not constitute sufficient ground for the annulment of the proceedings below or the reversal of the judgment. <br/><br/>The offense punished in section 19 of Act No. 175 is compled and consists of various acts specified by the law, all of which are included in the punishable act to which the refers. For this reason it is not strange that an information charging the offense punished by the law should contain statement of the various acts which constitute an integral part of the crime in question. <br/><br/>For these reasons, therefore, and considering that the commission of the crime prosecuted and the guilt of the defendant are fully established by the record, the judgment appealed should be affirmed, with the penalty therein imposed upon the defendant, and with the costs of this instance against him.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This case leaves no room for doubt as to the guilt of the defendant. Both the witnesses for the prosecution and those for the defense agree that the defendant was the slayer of Juan Palileo, whose death has given rise to this prosecution. There is not, however, the same unanimity of testimony with respect to the manner and circumstances under which the crime was committed. Witnesses for the prosecution testified that the accused inflicted upon Palileo two stabs which caused his immediate death, because Palileo had attempted to separate him from Luceno Silleno, with whom he was quarreling at that time. According to their statements the deceased was completely unarmed, and did nothing more than to attempt to separate the other two. According to the testimony of the witnesses for the defense the deceased arrived at the scene of the occurrence armed with a piece of bamboo, and without saying a word struck the defendant on the head with it from behind, and that the defendant thereupon turned around and inflicted the stab which left the deceased stretched on the ground. These witnesses state that there had been no provocation on the part of the defendant for the attack made upon him by the deceased. <br/><br/>The many and serious contradictions between the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution lead us to seriously doubt the truth of their testimony. Among, other serious conflicts we have noted, for example, the following: (1) Petra Manalo, the widow of the deceased, testifies that she was with the latter at the time of the occurrence of the crime, and that she was an eyewitness, and gives details of the crime in her testimony; on the other hand, Ysidro Palileo, a brother of the deceased, who also says that he was an eyewitness, testifies that the woman Manalo arrived at the place after his brother was dead, and that he does not know how it was that she heard that the deceased had been killed. This same witness, Ysidro Palileo, testifies that he did not see any woman at the place in question, or in its vicinity, at the time of the occurrence of the crime. Nevertheless Adriana Ramos testifies that she was there and saw the defendant stab the deceased in the back. (2) From the testimony of Petra Manalo it clearly appears that the killing in question occurred suddenly and instantaneously in the middle of a field at a place some hundred meters away from the nearest house. According to her statement, when her husband, who happened to be going by, drew near for the purpose of separating the accused and his adversary, Luceno Silleno, the accused suddenly turned upon him and inflicted two stabs which stretched him on the ground, and then immediately turned and fled. If this be true, the other witnesses for the prosecution, Adriana Ramos, Jose Rivera, Ysidro Palileo, and Hermongena Bonifacio, who, according to their own testimony, were in a house, would certainly not have had time to see the beginning of the occurrence, leave the house (supposing it to be the house nearest to the place), traverse the distance of 100 meters, and arrive at the scene of the affray in time to find the defendant in the act of stabbing the deceased. Nevertheless this is what these witnesses in effect swore to in their respective testimony. We find the testimony of these witnesses incompatible with the sudden and instantaneous manner in which the crime was committed, as described by the widow of the deceased. (3) The witness Jose Rivera is absolutely self-contradictory in his testimony. In one place, in reply to a question as to whether he was present at the quarrel between the defendant and the deceased, he says that all he knows about it he knows by hearsay. In another part of his testimony he says that he went to the place of the affray and saw the occurrence at a distance of some fifteen yards, and gives prolix details of the occurrence, as though he were actually present at the time. Of course we do not take into consideration the statement made by this same witness and by Adriana Ramos in the documents on folios 3 and 4 attached to the complaint (p. 1), in which both of them state that they saw the occurrence from their respective houses, and according to the statement of the former, at a considerable distance. We do not take these statements into consideration because these documents were not introduced as testimony in the course of the trial. If it were allowable to consider the contents of these documents it might also be said that they are in open contradiction with the testimony of these same witnesses as given at the trial, in which they stated that they went to the place of the affray and that they were there present when the crime was committed. <br/><br/>In view of these contradictions, in connection with the emphatic statement made by the witnesses for the defense that the witnesses Ysidro Palileo, Petra Manalo, and Hermogena Bonifacio were not present when the occurrence took place, we can not give credence to the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution. Considering the testimony of the witnesses for the defense to be true, we must apply in favor of the defendant the mitigating, circumstance of incomplete self-defense, comprised in paragraph 1 of article 9 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as there was an unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased in the attack made upon the defendant from behind with a cane, with which he struck him a blow on the head, the defendant, on the other hand, having not in the slightest degree provoked this attack. We can not, however, consider the defendant to be wholly exempt from criminal liability, because it is evident that he exceeded the limits of the necessity of the defense in using the dagger which he carried, and with it inflicting a mortal wound upon the deceased. Such means were not reasonably required or necessary to repel the attack, in view of the fact that it was made with nothing more than a piece of bamboo, a weapon insufficient to put the life of the person attacked in imminent peril, more especially in consideration of the insignificance of the attack itself, for, according to the witnesses, the blow struck by the deceased did not even bruise the accused. It follows that there is absent in this case one of the three requisites of section 1 of article 8 of the Code — that is, the reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the attack — in order that the necessity for self-defense may be a complete exemption from criminal liability. <br/><br/>In view of the character of the extenuating circumstances referred to, the penalty to be inflicted upon the defendant is that inferior by one or two degrees to that assigned by law for the crime of homicide, of which he is convicted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the Code. <br/><br/>We therefore condemn the defendant to suffer the penalty of six y ears and one day of prision mayor and to pay the sum of 500 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased. The judgment appealed, so modified, is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendant.

These people were taken by the accused to the town of Gapang, of the Province of Nueva Ecija. The persons kidnapped were not informed of the cause of their detention. Their aggressors were not officers or agents of the authorities. On the road, in the course of an hour, the greater part of the persons kidnapped were released, only three of them, named Agustin Maniquis, Luis Ramos, and Aniceto de los Santos continuing to be deprived of their liberty. The sequestration of these continued until 8 o’clock at night on the following day, at which time they were found in the barrio of Santa Cruz in the town of Bulacan, by Constabulary Inspector Jose Reyes, who set them at liberty, and captured the gun which was in possession of one of the accused. <br/><br/>The five defendants upon being arraigned pleaded not guilty. Two of them, Domingo Pascual and Guillermo Laureaga, who were recognized by four of the persons kidnapped, alleged that they knew nothing about the facts alleged against them. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding the denial of the defendants, and especially that of the two last referred to, four eyewitnesses testified that Laureaga was one of the kidnapers, and two witnesses also testified that the other defendants, Damaso Jose, Domingo Pascual, Andres Pascual, Marcos Peralta, and Eulalio Ocampo accompanied Laureaga. <br/><br/>The commission of the prime of illegally detaining ten persons is therefore an unquestionable fact. The purpose which the defendants had in committing this offense against personal liberty does not appear. The detention of those who were longest held by the prisoners exceeded twenty-four hours. Therefore the offense which the record shows to have been committed falls within the last paragraph of article 481 of the Penal Code. The five defendants here present, together with the deceased, Ocampo, are the proven authors by direct participation of this crime. The aggravating circumstances of nocturnity being present, and no mitigating circumstance concurring, the defendants should be sentenced to the maximum period of the penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium degrees. The judgment appealed should therefore be affirmed. <br/><br/>With respect to the defects which, according to the counsel for the defendants, exist in the information filed against them by the provincial fiscal, these defects are not of substance, nor do they affect any of the essential rights of the accused, but are merely defects of form. Therefore the information is sufficient, and no error exists for which the judgment should be annulled. The information is sufficiently explicit to enable one to immediately understand that the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, within whose territory lies the town of San Miguel de Mayumo; that the offense charged in the information is the crime of illegally detaining the ten persons mentioned, committed at one time, in the same place, and by the six accused, who committed this crime jointly by common agreement, and perhaps with some purpose common to all of them, but which, however, has not been made to appear. It further more this objection vas not raised in the court below by the defendants. It further appears from the information that the crime was commenced and consummated in the Province of Bulacan, and continued in Nueva Ecija, to which province three of the prisoners were taken and there subsequently released by an officer, the other seven persons having been previously released on the road. The character of the crime, complex by the number of the aggressors and of the persons injured, is not affected by the fact that its commission was continued in a different district. This is an offense which requires a successive and continued execution during a more or less lengthy period of time. As the information charges that the persons guilty of the offense in question were not officers, the burden was upon the defendants to prove that they were invested with authority to arrest the complainants. <br/><br/>In view of sections 5, 6, and 10 of General Orders, No. 58, dated April 23, 1900, and for the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed should be affirmed, with the costs in equal parts against each of the surviving defendants. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

S., 556)<br/><br/>It is distinctly a civil proceeding, and as such is provided for and regulated in the Code of Civil Procedure. <br/><br/>The doctrine of ex post facto laws refers only to the criminal law. <br/><br/>This case must be determined under the provisions of Act No 272,  \"An act amending chapter 26, relating to proceedings of <em>habeas corpus</em> enacted by the Philippine Commission on the 21st day of October, 1901. The history of the legislation embodied in this act is too recent to require a review of the circumstances and conditions under which it was enacted. Its purpose was to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction between the civil and military branches of the Government. By the provisions of this act, when the commanding general or any general officer in command of the department or district certifies in answer to a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> directed against a military officer or soldier that the prisoner is held by him either —<br/><br/>(1)\tAs a prisoner of war; or<br/><br/>(2)\tAs a member of the Army, a civil employee thereof, or a camp follower subject to its discipline; or<br/><br/>(3)\tAs a prisoner committed by a military court or commission prior to October 1, 1901; or<br/><br/>(4)\tAs a prisoner arrested and held for trial before a military court or commission, before October 15,1901, for a violation of the laws of war committed before the same date; or<br/><br/>(5)\tAs a person guilty of the violation of the laws of war committed in certain unpacified provinces and territories named —<br/><br/>such certificate shall be at conclusive answer to a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> against a military officer or soldier, and a sufficient excuse for not producing the prisoner. <br/><br/>It is not disputed that the respondent holds the petitioner by and through the orders of the commanding general, Division of the Philippines, and that he is in the custody of the United States Government through the respondent, the Warden of Bilibid, as the agent and representative of the military, such agency appears in the certificate of the commanding general and also in the return of the <em>Respondent</em>. <br/><br/>It is equally clear that the certificate of General Davis of date the 18th day of February, 1903, is in compliance with Act No 272, from which it appears distinctly that the petitioner is a prisoner committed by a military commission prior to October l, 1901; and further that he is a prisoner arrested and held for trial before October 15, 1901, for a violation of the laws of war committed before the same date. <br/><br/>We think the certificate of the commanding general is in strict compliance with the provisions of the law, and was a conclusive return to the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. <br/><br/>The power of the court to either issue the writ or discharge the prisoner is ended when such return has been made and the proceedings must there end. <br/><br/>While the power conceded to the commanding general is of vital importance and an abuse of it would be attended with great evil, still, the high position of those to whom it has been confided as doubtless believed to be a sufficient guaranty that it could not be exercised except after careful investigation and with a due appreciation of the delicate nature of the power reposed in the commanding general by the legislative authority. <br/><br/>In view of the disposition which the law requires us to make of the case it is unnecessary to discuss other interesting questions raised by counsel for the petitioner. <br/><br/>The order and decision of the judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila ordering that the prisoner be discharged from custody of the respondent must be reversed, the proceedings dismissed, and the prisoner remanded to the custody of the respondent It is so ordered and directed Costs of proceeding will be adjudged against the petitioner. <br/><br/>Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Counsel for the defendants has petitioned the court to grant the defendants the benefit of the amnesty. This raises a question which, if decided in the affirmative, will make it unnecessary to decide the principal issue in the case. <br/><br/>The defendant Alhambra on the date in question was the commanding officer of the revolutionary forces of the zone in which was included the town of Puncan, in the Province of Nueva Ecija, in whose jurisdiction the crime prosecuted was committed. In obedience to an order given by him to his codefendants, who were his soldiers, the latter, one day in the month of February, 1900, captured and killed Leopoldo Palacios and his family. These facts are, in our opinion, fully proven in the case. Among the evidence introduced by the prosecution are included certain sworn statements made by some of the defendants in November, 1901, before Lieutenant Taylor, of the United States Army, of which the originals were attached to the record at the request of counsel for the Government. It may be said that to a certain extent these statements constituted the sole direct proof of the killing of Palacios and his family, if we exclude the testimony of the defendants themselves in the preliminary investigation held before the provincial fiscal, which they withdrew at the trial. <br/><br/>In their statements made before Lieutenant Taylor two of the deponents, Maximo del Castillo and Anacleto Olengco, affirm that Alhambra ordered the capture and killing of Palacios and his family because he suspected that they were secret police or spies of the Americans. Ciriaco Reyes, a witness for the prosecution, substantially corroborates this statement. He says that the motive which led Alhambra to give the order was that Leopoldo intended to surrender to the Americans. The complaining witness, Crisanto Sanchez, brother-in-law of Leopoldo Palacios, also testifies, on page 60, that Alhambra wanted to kill him too, because he believed that the witness was a member of the secret police. This statement is corroborated by that of the witness Ciriaco Reyes, just mentioned. <br/><br/>We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the testimony given by the accused before Lieutenant Taylor, not only because their statements were not controverted in the course of the trial, they, on the contrary, having been used as proof by the prosecution, but also because it can not be presumed that they gave this testimony; with the self-serving purpose of availing themselves of the benefit of the amnesty, for the simple reason that the amnesty proclamation was not promulgated until eight months later, that is, on the 4th of July, 1902 The sincerity of these statements is still more clearly shown by the fact that they have been corroborated with respect to the motive which led the defendants to commit the crime prosecuted by the very satisfactory testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution. <br/><br/>In view of the character of the motives referred to, and which were due to the belief on the part of the defendants that Leopoldo Palacios and his family were spies of the American Army, and therefore their political enemies, we hold that the crime in question, in its complex character of murder with robbery, was a result of internal political hatred or dissensions of a political nature between Filipinos, manifested in this case by reprisals, not only on-the person but also on the property of those whom they considered open enemies of the cause which they supported and defended; that the defendants committed said crime while insurgents and during the insurrection against the United States; and that they are therefore entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902. <br/><br/>We therefore declare that the said defendants are pardoned, subject to taking the oath prescribed by the amnesty proclamation So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Willard, <em>J.</em>, I agree with the result. <br/><br/>Torres, <em>J.</em>, I am of the opinion that the accused should be pardoned as to the crime of murder, but convicted of the crime of robbery in a band. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">This is a petition by the legal administrator of the intestate estate of D. Pedro Hernaez for a mandamus, to be directed to the judge of the Special Court of Negros, requiring him to admit an appeal which the petitioner claims was duly taken by him from an order settling the account of D. Pelabio Hernaez as judicial administrator of the estate. <br/><br/>It is stated in the petition that the order was made June 7, 1902; that the parties were notified of the order June 11; that on June 12 the petitioner filed a notice of appeal therefrom; that no order was made by the court upon notice of appeal or fixing the amount of the bond required; and that the petitioner thereupon filed a bond for 500 pesos in accordance with the verbal indication of the judge. It is not stated in the petition when this bond was filed, but it is stated that it was returned to the petitioner, and that on July 20 an order was made by the court disallowing the appeal as not having been duly taken. <br/><br/>The answer of the judge states that the appeal was disallowed for the reason that the appellant did not file the bond within twenty-one days from the entry of the order appealed from. <br/><br/>Taking the facts stated in the petition and answer to be true the question is presented whether in an appeal under section 778 of the new Code of Civil Procedure from the settlement of an administrator’s account, where the appellant has filed a notice of appeal within twenty-one days and no order has been made by the judge limiting the time for filing an appeal bond, the appeal is lost by failure to file such bond before the expiration of the period of twenty-one days. <br/><br/>Section 779 of the Code provides as follows:  \"The person thus appealing [under section 778] shall perfect his appeal within twenty-one days after the entry of the order, decree, or judgment by the Court of First Instance, by filing with the clerk of that court a statement in writing that he appeals to the Supreme Court from such order, decree, or judgment The clerk shall thereupon transmit to the Supreme Court a certified transcript of the account embraced in the order, decree, or judgment, and of the order, decree, or judgment appealed from, and of the appeal.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Section 780 is as follows  \"Before an appeal is allowed the person appealing under the two preceding sections shall give a satisfactory bond to the court, conditioned that he will prosecute the appeal to effect and pay the intervening damages and costs occasioned by such appeal.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The language of these sections, read together, admits of the construction that the right to the appeal is conditionally secured by the filing of the notice of appeal within the prescribed period, subject to be defeated if the party fails to file a satisfactory bond within such period as may in each case be specially fixed by the judge. We hold this to be the meaning of the law. No inconvenience that we can perceive would result from a practice in accordance with this construction, and, on the other hand, great inconvenience and hardship, arising from the difficulties in communication which exist in many parts of the Archipelago, would inevitably result from requiring the filing of a bond satisfactory to the judge in all cases indiscriminately within a nonextendible period of twenty-one days. Where the provisions of the Code are open to more than one construction we are bound to prefer that one which, under the very exceptional conditions in which it must necessarily be administrated in these Islands, will most effectually  \"promote its object and assist the parties in obtaining speedy justice.\" (Sec. 2.) <br/><br/>A mandamus will not be issued to the defendant as judge of the Special Court of Negros, that court having ceased to exist under the provisions of the law by which it was created. (Act of the Commission, No. 166, sec. 6.) Upon the filing of a bond within twenty-one days from the service of this order upon the petitioner satisfactory to the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Negros to which the record in the proceeding in which the appeal was taken has been transferred, it will be the duty of the clerk of such court to transmit to this court a certified transcript of the account embraced in the order appealed from and of the appeal. In case the clerk fails so to do the petitioner may apply for an amendment making him a party to this petition and asking for such order as may be necessary in the premises. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I am unable to concur in the opinion of the majority of the court. <br/><br/>The application for mandamus should be denied for the reason that the time for filing the appeal bond had expired before the appeal bond was presented to the judge of the Court of First Instance for his approval. <br/><br/>The method for perfecting such an appeal is regulated by sections 779 and 780, Code of Civil Procedure, 1901. <br/><br/>Section 779 reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The person thus appealing shall perfect his appeal within twenty-one days after the entry of the order, decree, or judgment by the Court of First Instance, by filing with the clerk of that court a statement in writing that he appeals to the Supreme Court from such order, decree, or judgment. The clerk shall thereupon transmit to the Supreme Court a certified transcript of the account embraced in the order, decree, or judgment, and of the order, decree, or judgment appealed from, and of the appeal.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Section 780 reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Bond for appeal. — Before an appeal is allowed the person appealing under the two preceding sections shall give a satisfactory bond to the court, conditioned that he will prosecute the appeal to effect and pay the intervening damages and costs occasioned by such appeal.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance was rendered on the 7th day of June, 1902. <br/><br/>The appeal bond was not presented to the judge for his approval until the 20th day of July, more than forty days having elapsed after rendition of judgment. <br/><br/>The statute requires that the appeal must be perfected within twenty-one days, and, by the express language of section 780, before an appeal is allowed the bond must be given. <br/><br/>To perfect the appeal two requisites must concur, to wit, the notice of appeal, and the filing of the appeal bond. <br/><br/>It is said that section 780 does not fix the time within which the appeal bond must be filed. But if the appeal must be perfected within twenty-one days after the rendition of the judgment, and if it can not be perfected until the appeal bond has been filed, then the inevitable conclusion is that the appeal bond must be filed within twenty-one days. The two sections taken together seem so plain as not to justify a resort to the rules of construction. Any doubt that might arise can be settled by the common rule of construction applying to adopted and reenacted statutes.  \"Where a statute of a foreign jurisdiction, which had there received a settled judicial construction, is adopted, wholly or in part, and enacted as a law of the State adopting it, it is presumed that the construction previously put upon it is adopted with it, and it should be interpreted according to such construction.\" (Black on Interpretation of Laws, p. 159.) <br/><br/>This section of our Code was taken from the Vermont statutes. <br/><br/>By a comparison of section 780 with section 2589 of the Vermont statutes, it will be seen that section 780 is a literal copy of section 2589, which was a reenactment of section 2273, R. L. Vt. <br/><br/>Prior to the adoption of our statutes, in 1884 the supreme court of Vermont in the case of Lambert, administrator, v. Merrill’s Estate (56 Vt. Rep., p. 464), held that the bond must be filed within twenty days from the date of the decision appealed from, and where the bond has not been filed within twenty days the appeal will be dismissed. This decision is affirmed by the same court at the January term, 1894, in the case re Bodwell, 66 Vt. Rep., p. 231. <br/><br/>This construction of section 780 harmonizes our statutes with those existing generally throughout the United States. Where the law requires that a bond shall be filed in order to perfect an appeal, under these statutes it is the rule that there is no effective appeal until the bond is filed and that the bond must be filed within the time prescribed by law. All the requirements of the statute for taking and perfecting an appeal are deemed jurisdictional and must be strictly complied with. (2 Enc. Pl. and Pr., 16; Elliott’s App. Pro., 208.) <br/><br/>The court does not indicate in its decision within what time the appeal bond should be filed. This leaves the practice in a state of uncertainty. There are no compensating benefits for this uncertainty in procedure. Neither convenience nor justice requires it. On the contrary, it is inequitable to delay indefinitely a party in the enforcement of his judgment by the defendant simply filing a notice of his intention to appeal. <br/><br/>Section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure is cited in support of the decision. The section reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Construction of Code. — The provisions of this Code, and the proceedings under it, shall be liberally construed, in order to promote its object and assist the parties in obtaining speedy justice.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This provision of the Code might be cited with the same or with still greater force in support of the opposite contention. The object of section 780 is to protect by prompt means a party in whose favor the judgment has been rendered from the damages resulting from the delay in its enforcement. The statute should be liberally construed to promote this object. This will not be done if the provision is so construed as to permit the defendant to delay indefinitely the enforcement of the judgment without security. <br/><br/>The clause in question should not be used to undo legislative intent nor to confer upon the court a general dispensing power as to the requirements of the law. <br/><br/>The method required by the legislative authority in appeals is exclusive. It can not be disregarded and the court’s own rules substituted therefor. </div>'\n",

He allowed himself the same freedom and familiarity which Diego Misa and his wife had been for a long time accustomed to allow him, lying down at once on a lancape which was there. The woman, with her two children of tender age, Juan and Felicidad by name, and another child a few years older, named Pedro Muya, was in the house. Santiago Merin remained on the lancape, and a few moments after he saw Engracia Monsalud go to bed he approached her and attacked her with a large-sized clasp knife, causing several injuries in different parts of her body and leaving her dead, besides destroying the foetus which she had in her womb. Not content with this, he took possession of the money and jewelry belonging to the proprietors of the house, the taking of which was undoubtedly the principal motive of these murders.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The complaint is unskillfully drawn, but it is sufficient to charge the commission of the complex crime of robo with homicidio, defined and punished in article 503, No. 1, in connection with article 502 of the Code. <br/><br/>Upon being arraigned upon this complaint the defendant stated  \"that he did murder Engracia Monsalud and her two children, Juan and Felicidad, and another child by the name of Pedro Muya, in the manner and form charged in the said complaint, but that he did not commit the robbery with which he is charged in the said complaint.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The prosecution then introduced the testimony of two witnesses, Francisco Sanchez and Diego Misa. The evidence of Sanchez is not important and does not require notice. Diego Misa testified in substance that while in Masinloc he heard that his son Juan had been killed by ladrones; that he returned home, arriving there at 11 o’ clock on the morning of April 22 and found the dead bodies of his wife, his two children, Juan and Felicidad, and his nephew, Pedro Muya, lying side by side, with their throats cut, on the door of his house; that he heard the defendant confess to Patricio Lesaca that he had killed the family of the witness, saying that he was drunk at the time. The witness identified a knife shown to him as one that had belonged to his wife, and stated that he found it near the bodies in the house on his return home. He further testified that when he returned to his house. The found a large number of articles of jewelry and 50 pesos in money missing, and that he had since received most of the articles of jewelry from Patricio Lesaca,  \"who had received them from the defendant, Santiago Merin,\" and that  \"Santiago Merin had told Patricio Lesaca that he had hidden the things in a big tree in the pueblo of Infanta, and that he, Patricio, had gone there to get them.\" He also stated that he had recovered the money. <br/><br/>The defendant was then called to the stand by the court, and was shown a knife, presumably the one identified by Misa, and stated that that was the knife he had  \"used in killing Engracia Monsalud and the others,\" and that it did not belong to him. There was no further evidence. <br/><br/>The court found as facts that the defendant  \"did on the night of the 22d day of April, 1902, in the pueblo of Santa Cruz, in the Province of Zambales, and in the house of one Diego Misa, in the said pueblo, with evident premeditation, kill and assassinate Engracia Monsalud the wife of Diego Misa, Juan Misa and Felicidad Misa, children of Engracia Monsalud, and another child named Pedro Muya,\" and  \"that the said Santiago Merin did at the same time and place take possession of the sum of 50 pesos, Mexican, and several pieces of gold jewelry, the property of the said Diego Misa, with the intent then and there to appropriate the said money and gold jewelry to his own use, and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property therein,\" and by virtue of the confession of the defendant that he was guilty of the crime charged in the complaint presented in said cause, and by virtue of the foregoing findings of fact from the testimony given in said cause, it sentenced the defendant to the penalty of death, to be executed by hanging,  \"at a time and in a public place and by a person to be hereafter designated by the court, in accordance with the existing laws and the laws hereafter enacted.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The case comes to this court en consulta. <br/><br/>As respects the killing of Engracia Monsalud no question can arise in view of the defendant’s confessions before and at the trial. As he denies that he committed the robbery it is necessary to determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to warrant us in finding that this element of the complex crime with which he is charged has been established. There is the testimony of Misa as to Lesaca’s having received the jewelry from the defendant, and as to what the defendant told Lesaca concerning its hiding place, and although this is apparently hearsay, it was received without objection, and we may properly attach to it such probative force as we think it possesses, which under the circumstances of the case is considerable. There is, moreover, the testimony of Misa that when he arrived home a few hours after all his family had been killed in his house by the defendant he found the money and jewelry missing. To this latter testimony we attach decisive weight. In the absence of any other known motive for the crime it would be, in our judgment, to reject the universal teaching of experience to refuse to draw the inference that the same person who killed the occupants of the house also committed the robbery. <br/><br/>We can not, therefore, bring ourselves to doubt, taking the record as it stands, that both the homicide and the robbery were committed by the defendant, although we are constrained to say that the failure of the fiscal to utilize at the trial the very complete evidence of the defendant’s guilt as respects the robbery which the record of the preliminary investigation shows was available, indicates a misconception as to the nature and degree of proof required for conviction, which might under some circumstances easily lead to a serious miscarriage of justice. <br/><br/>The fact that the crime was committed in the house of the victim is to be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance. (Code, art. 10, No. 20.) The extenuating circumstance is suggested that the defendant was drunk when he committed the crime, but there is no sufficient proof of this. The penalty prescribed for the crime of robo with homicidio is cadena perpetua to death, and under the rule for the application of a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, where there is an aggravating circumstance and no extenuating circumstance, as in the present case Code, art. 80, rule 1), it is to be applied in its maximum degree. <br/><br/>Although we are of opinion that the crime of robo with homicidio was committed by the defendant, and although our judgment is based upon that view of the facts, we are not to be understood as holding that a conviction could not also be had for asesinato, on the theory that that crime is sufficiently charged in the complaint, inasmuch as the facts set out therein may be regarded as showing alevosia and that the defendant pleaded guilty of murdering Engracia Monsalud  \"in the manner and form charged in the said complaint.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>We find the defendant guilty of having committed the crime of robo, on account or on occasion of which homicide has resulted, as said crime is defined in article 503, No. 1, of the Penal Code, in connection with article 503 of the same, with the aggravating circumstance above stated and with no extenuating circumstance, and we sentence him to the penalty of death, and to the payment of an indemnity in the sum of 1,000 pesos to Diego Misa, the husband of Engracia Monsalud, and to the restitution of such of the articles stolen as have not been recovered, and, in case this penalty is not executed by reason of the defendant’s being pardoned, to the accessory penalties of perpetual, absolute disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for the term of his natural life, unless said accessory penalties shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. <br/><br/>As the crime was committed and the prosecution for the same was pending prior to September 2, 1902, the date of the enactment of the Commission abolishing the use of the garrote in executions of criminals, the sentence will be executed in accordance with the provisions of the pre-existing law relating to executions. (Act No. 451 of the Commission, sec. 3.) <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below will be modified in conformity with this opinion, and affirmed in other respects, and the cause will be returned to that court for the execution thereof.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It sufficiently appears from the record that the defendants, at the time in question, went to the house of Juan Rodriguez, alleged to have been broken into, with the intent of making an entrance there at all cost, even against the will of the said Juan Rodriguez. It does not, however, appear to be certain that they did in fact succeed in entering, as the record is not very explicit upon this point. It is evident that they succeeded in entering the first door of the house, either violently by breaking it open, as alleged by the complainant, or because they found it already open, as testified by the defendant Bartolome Ostrea. It does not appear, however, whether this door formed an integral part of the house or whether, on the contrary, it was an outer door, separate and independent from the body of the house. We are inclined to believe that the latter is the fact, in view of the testimony in the case. The complainant calls this first door the front door, and adds that upon seeing it had been broken by the accused he immediately closed the second door and did not allow them to enter his house. In another part of his testimony he states that when they (the accused) saw that they could not enter the house they went away. The other witness for the prosecution, Benigno Sebastian, testifies that Bartolome Ostrea called to his wife, who was in the house, but that he could not get in, because the doors were closed. Bartolome Ostrea, on his part, in his testimony at the trial says that the first door was open, and that the following door at the entrance to the house was closed. From this statement it would appear that the second door was that at the entrance to the house in question. <br/><br/>In view of the terms in which these witnesses expressed themselves and the lack of other more precise data in the record it may be concluded that, notwithstanding the fact that the defendants entered the first door, they did not succeed in entering the house. It is possible that this conclusion is not in conformity with the facts as they really occurred, but it is the legal conclusion from the data disclosed by the record and upon which alone we must rely for our decision. <br/><br/>In consequence, the defendants are only responsible for the crime of an attempted forcible entry into the dwelling, and not for a consummated entry, as considered by the court below in the judgment appealed. It has been proven that in the execution of this act the defendants employed violence and intimidation, and for nearly half an hour tried to push open the door at the entrance to the house, and that Bartolome Ostrea fired several shots from his revolver upon seeing that Rodriguez refused to open the door. The latter says that Ostrea fired three or four shots. The other witnesses for the prosecution only heard one. It is a matter of indifference, however, whether one or more shots were fired for the purposes of considering the circumstance of intimidation, more especially in view of the fact that Bartolome himself admits that he discharged the revolver which he carried, although he adds that he only fired in the air. <br/><br/>The concurrence of this circumstance brings the act in question within the sanction of paragraph 2 of article 191 of the Penal Code. In favor of the accused we must consider the mitigating circumstance of drunkenness (No. 6 of art. 9 of the Penal Code), as it appears from the testimony of the complainant himself and that of Benigno Sebastian that they were drunk at the time in question, and that they are not habitual drunkards. In the present case we must also consider as mitigating the circumstance that the complainant, Juan Rodriguez, is the father-in-law of Bartolome Ostrea, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 10, for, in view o f this close relationship, it is not considered that the defendant would regard himself as a stranger in the home of the complainant, to which it is to be presumed he ordinarily had free access as a member of the Rodriguez family. The fact, sufficiently proven in the case, that he believed his wife the daughter of the said Rodriguez, was in the house at the time in question, may also have contributed to lead him to believe, although erroneously, that he had a right to enter the house. <br/><br/>Upon the grounds set forth, and in view of the provisions of articles 66 and 75, paragraph 2 of article 91, and article 92 of the Penal Code, we condemn each of the defendants to a fine of 325 pesetas, or to subsidiary imprisonment, in case of nonpayment, at the rate of one day for each 12 1/2 pesetas. The judgment appealed, thus modified, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendants.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">At about 1 o’clock in the afternoon of the 6th of March, 1902, Ricardo Luciano went to a warehouse in which was stored sugar belonging to his brother, Jose Luciano, situated in the barrio of Talimundoc, in the town of Magalang, Pampanga. He found among several empty sugar pots a piece of bojo cane full of molasses. Upon inquiring from the laborers which of them had hidden it there, Francisco Dunca replied that he was the person who had done so, after having asked Don Antonio Luciano to give it to him. The accused, annoyed by this conduct on the part of Dunca, prejudicial to the interests of his brother, picked up the piece of bojo cane full of molasses — about half a yard in length — and struck Dunca two blows. These caused slight bruises, a slanting one in the middle of the right thigh, and another in the left lumbar region, between the ninth and twelfth ribs, the blow falling longitudinally to the body. After this Dunca left the warehouse, walking in the direction of a cane field. At a distance of about 250 yards he fell to the ground. Felipe de los Santos, seeing this went to assist him. Finding him in a bad condition, he called some other laborers, and among them they picked Dunca up and carried him to a shed at the side of the warehouse. Here he died a few hours afterwards. The record discloses the fact that the deceased was in a sickly condition, and had been suffering from fever before this occurred. <br/><br/>An autopsy of the body of Francisco Dunca was held by two physicians. From statements made by them it appears that they found on the exterior of the body the two bruises which have already been mentioned. In the interior cavity of the body the spleen was found to be enormously hypertrophied, it being three times its usual size. In the lower portion was found a large cavity with a rupture; and the tissues were found to be exceedingly weak and friable. Hematoma was noted in the interior of the cavity, and between the intestines were clots of blood. It was observed, also, that the stomach was dilated with food. <br/><br/>The two physicians agreed that the death of Dunca was due to the hemorrhage resulting from the rupture of the spleen, which, owing to the abnormal condition of that organ hypertrophied and triplicated in size, might have been occasioned by a fall, a simple emotion or moral impression, a physical effort, or by overeating. Dr. Mesina affirmed, however, that the rupture of the spleen could not be attributed to the blow received, because the bruise found on the back of the body was not in the region of the spleen, but in the region of the kidneys, which were not affected; that if the patient had staggered after receiving the blow, by reason of the abundance of hemorrhage, then the rupture might be attributed to the blow, but that if this were not so, then the rupture of the spleen must be due to some other cause; and that, in view of the antecedents of the deceased and the state of his spleen, his death could not be attributed to violence. <br/><br/>Dr. Liongson averred that if the spleen as it was found at the time of the autopsy had been ruptured in consequence of a blow received near the region in which that organ is situated the patient would have fallen mortally wounded in less than two minutes after receiving the blow and that therefore he did not believe that the said blow had occasioned the rupture of the spleen, the pathological condition of which was due to the malaria with which Dunca had suffered during, the preceding months. The doctor expressed- the opinion that Dunca’s death was in consequence of the rupture of the hypertrophied spleen, caused by some one of the causes previously enumerated, because Dunca, after receiving the blow, walked without difficulty about the warehouse and through the field for a distance of some 250 yards, and the fall which he suffered might have been either the cause of the rupture of the spleen or the consequence of this accident. <br/><br/>The accused, having been arraigned on the charge of homicide, pleaded not guilty. His counsel introduced witnesses who, among other things testified, that Dunca, after having been struck by the accused, but not heavily, with a piece of bojo cane, left the warehouse, going toward his house, and at a distance of some 250 yards fell to the ground, and, having; been picked up, died shortly after near the warehouse. They added that the deceased was a chronic sufferer from fever and chills. <br/><br/>From the facts related it appears that the crime of homicide, defined and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, has been committed. The death of Francisco Dunca took place in consequence of a rupture of the spleen, producing a copious internal hemorrhage, as shown by the autopsy and post-mortem examination made by the two physicians, which rupture must have been occasioned, among other efficient causes, in view of the pathological condition of the deceased, by the blows which he receive on the body some minutes before falling to ground. If, as the physicians affirmed, such a rupture of the spleen might have been the effect of a moral impression, a physical effort, or overeating, it is unquestionable that the violent acts of which Dunca was the victim, if they were not the direct cause of the rupture of that important organ, at least produced a strong physical and a considerable moral shock. The complication produced thereby, owing to his feeble condition, resulted in his death, an event which the blows possibly would not have caused had he been a strong and healthy man. <br/><br/>The blows given Dunca were illicit, and acts contrary to law, whatever may have been the motive which led up to them. In order to determine the character, extent, and consequences of the punishable act and to define and classify the offense, it is necessary to take into consideration its results and the effect produced on the deceased. <br/><br/>It is true that, in consequence of former ill health, Dunca’s spleen was in a hypertrophied condition and was three times its natural size; but it is also true that the rupture of the spleen and the consequent hemorrhage occurred a few minutes after the blows were received. Therefore, even in case the lesion of the organ was due to a supervenient accident to the deceased, already seriously ill, it is unquestionable that the ill treatment given him provoked this fatal result and hastened the death of a man who a few moments before had been working in the warehouse and able to move about freely. <br/><br/>The person guilty of the ill treatment referred to is the sole responsible author of the crime committed. He who executes an illicit act, in violation of law, is responsible for all the consequences which such an act may produce. He cannot free himself from responsibility by reason of the circumstance that he did not intend to kill the man he injured. The defendant willfully struck Dunca two blows with a bojo cane, with the wrongful intent of punishing him. This was an unauthorized act, and constituted a breach of the penal law. Being illicit, the accused is presumed to have acted with malice and is criminally responsible. (Article 1 of the Code and judgments of March 10, 1871, and June 26,1880.) <br/><br/>The act committed by Luciano having been a perfectly voluntary and intentional one — an act entirely illegal, and reproved by the penal law — and the injured man having fallen to the ground after having walked a distance of some 250 yards, as a consequence of the rupture of his spleen, it is unquestionable, notwithstanding the fact that the two physicians who held the post-mortem examination could not affirm with certainty what was the direct cause of the rupture, that the violence with which the deceased was treated more or less directly caused his death; or, at least, it was a concomitant cause which largely contributed to and hastened his death. Consequently the aggressor is certainly responsible for all the consequences of his criminal action, even if his intention was not that of causing death. Ricardo Luciano, therefore, must be adjudged the responsible author of the crime of homicide. <br/><br/>This lack of intention, however, decreases his responsibility, and must be taken into consideration, together with the other mitigating circumstance — that is, that the accused acted on the impulse of passion, produced in his mind by the conduct of the deceased. The trifling value of the sugar or molasses stolen is a matter of indifference in this case. The theft committed by Dunca might have been imitated by the other laborers, and if each were to have taken an equal quantity of molasses, and were to do it frequently and repeatedly, the loss would in a short time become considerable. It will be readily seen, therefore, how and why the knowledge of the theft of the small amount of sugar stolen might have produced this burst of anger. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime defined no aggravating circumstance was present, and therefore, there being two strongly marked mitigating circumstances, to wit, Nos. 5 and 7 of article 9 of the Code, the accused should, in accordance with the precept of paragraph 5 of article 81 of the Code, be convicted, the penalty imposed to be that immediately inferior in degree to that assigned for the crime by article 404 — that is prision mayor in its minimum degree. <br/><br/>With respect to the allegation of the defense as to the withdrawal of the complaint by the provincial fiscal, we hold that under the accusatory system the Government may abandon the criminal action and withdraw the information, if unable to obtain evidence, before the trial has commenced; but after the trial has begun and after the evidence is taken and the defense has been made, the accusation can not be so withdrawn. The judge, in the performance of his duty, may continue the proceeding and render such judgment as he may deem proper under the law, as was done in this case. <br/><br/>Upon the foregoing considerations, therefore, the judgment below must be affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendant, the indemnity to the widow and heirs of the deceased being fixed, however, in the sum of 1,000 Mexican pesos. <br/><br/>This decision is strictly in accord with the rigorous precept of the penal law; but a consideration of the circumstances under which the act resulting in the homicide was committed, the cause which induced Ricardo Luciano to strike Francisco Dunca, and the pathological condition of the latter, leads Judges Torres and Ladd to consider excessive the penalty assigned by the law and which has been imposed. This is not a case in which an abandoned criminal, armed with a deadly weapon, attacked the deceased with the intention of killing him, but that of the unfortunate victim of an accident which has brought him under the operation of the penal law. It can not be said, furthermore, that he was guilty of great cruelty in the punishment he intended to inflict upon Dunca. Consequently the judges mentioned are of the opinion that it would be equitable to refer this case to the Chief Executive, in order that he may exercise clemency, should he see fit to do so, by granting a partial pardon and thereby mitigating the marked severity of the penalty imposed upon the accused, this action being authorized by article 2, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Juan Babasa, late on the night of January 27, 1899, went to the house of Maria Antolin and called to the latter’s daughter, Fausta, telling her to come out. Fausta, Maria, and a little boy, the latter’s son, came out to see who was calling. No sooner had Fausta, who went ahead, arrived at the door of the house than she received a wound in the abdomen, from which she died on the following day. This is the statement of the mother and of the boy, Julio Bauan. <br/><br/>The death was discovered by a police officer named Mamerto Gabot. He testified that, having asked the mother what had caused the death of the deceased, she replied that the girl had died of a stomach ache, but he, suspecting that it was the result of a crime, sent for a doctor to examine the body; that the doctor found the wound in the abdomen, and stated that the girl, who was some 16 years of age, had died from its effects. The mother, nevertheless, testified that some two days before Babasa had been making love to her daughter, who did not respond to his advances, as he was a married man, and that on the night in question the facts occurred as above stated. Maria Antolin, in her testimony, says:  \"Upon stepping outside, Fausta asked him, ’What do you want of me?’ and Juan, without saying anything, stabbed my daughter.\" The girl then, feeling that she was wounded, sat down on the second step of the stairway and from there was carried by her mother into the house. <br/><br/>The accused testified that he was drunk and did not know what he had done; that he had no intention of doing anything of the kind, and that on this account the family had promised not to make any complaint about the occurrence, they being convinced that he had not intended to inflict the wound, which was simply the unfortunate result of a movement of his hand. The entire defense has consisted in showing that the accused maintained amorous relations with the deceased, to which several witnesses have testified. <br/><br/>The judge, considering present the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, abuse of superiority, and the commission of the offense in the dwelling house of the deceased, and the specific circumstances of premeditation and treachery (alevosia), condemned the accused to death. <br/><br/>We can not consider that the specific circumstance of premeditation is present, because there is no evidence indicating reflection, which is required for this circumstance. We consider the specific circumstance of treachery (alevosia) to be present, because of the means employed by the defendant in the commission of the crime, which was held to constitute alevosia by the supreme court of Spain in its judgment of July 14,1876. This circumstance being present, it becomes unnecessary to consider the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superiority and nocturnity. Neither is there any necessity for considering the circumstance of the commission of the offense in a dwelling house, as this fact does not appear to be proven by the testimony of Maria Antolin. <br/><br/>Therefore, there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the specific crime of murder must be punished by the medium degree of the penalty fixed by the law. By virtue thereof we decide that Juan Babasa must be condemned to life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) with the legal accessories, to the payment of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the nearest relatives of the deceased, and to pay the costs of both instances. <br/><br/>Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Five members of the Constabulary and three members of the municipal police of the town of Santa Rosa, in Nueva Ecija, having set out to look for Jacinto de Jesus, named by Antonio Mendoza as one of several men who had assaulted his house, located the said Jacinto in the vicinity of the town of Jaen, in the same province. Sergt. Alejandro de los Reyes, of the Constabulary, says that he found Jacinto de Jesus tied to a tree and in a very bad condition, as a result of a beating inflicted upon him by the three defendants, Salunday, of the municipal police of Santa Rosa, and the Constabulary men, Candelaria and Carandang. Three hours after he was untied Jacinto de Jesus died. A physician certified that he was covered with bruises from head to foot. The doctor stated that blows on the thorax probably caused the death. <br/><br/>The testimony for the prosecution is convincing, and is supported even by the statements of the accused themselves. According to Alejandro Reyes (but testifying as to what he had heard the accused say), it appears that Jacinto de Jesus had tried to resist with one of the bolos which he was carrying, having made the motion of putting his hand to his belt or sheath. The witness says, however, that the deceased was carrying this bolo because he was cutting cane, and that the other bolo he had with him was a short one, about a span in length. Another member of the Constabulary there present testifies that Jacinto de Jesus threw himself into an attitude of resistance, as though about to draw his bolo, but the same witness affirms that Espiridion Salunday had ordered them to hang up Jacinto, and that after he was suspended he confessed that he had been kidnapped by some malefactors. So that either because he attempted to resist or for the purpose of forcing him to make some statement, the accused were guilty of the ill treatment which caused the death of Jacinto de Jesus. <br/><br/>The court below condemned Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo Candelaria, as principals, to the death penalty, and Dionisio Carandang, as accessory, to fourteen years and nine months of cadena temporal. <br/><br/>Dionisio Carandang was not a mere accessory. He also illtreated Jacinto de Jesus, as appears from the testimony of several witnesses. Although his participation was nothing more than that of having tied Jacinto de Jesus to the tree, such participation in the act would be that of a coprincipal. <br/><br/>In tying Jacinto to a tree the three defendants acted treacherously (alevosamente). Whether it was to prevent him from making resistance, whether it was to torture him for the purpose of making him give information, or whether it was for the purpose of inflicting further punishment, the fact is that by this means the defendants secured themselves against any risk which might have arisen from an attempt at self-defense on the part of the victim. We are of opinion that they had no intention to cause so great an evil as that which resulted, but this does not neutralize that other qualifying circumstance of the resulting death, because if there was no alevosia for the purpose of killing there was alevosia for the purpose of ill-treating. The means employed were not made use of for the precise purpose of making certain the death of Jacinto de Jesus, but as a safe means of illtreating him without risk to the persons who were doing so. If by this means the ill treatment was aggravated, it follows that it is a qualifying circumstance in the death which resulted. It was not a condition of the purpose, but it was a condition of the criminal act itself, in whatever sense this be taken. <br/><br/>What we can not consider is the circumstance of extreme cruelty. The death of Jacinto de Jesus was not produced by any special, precise act done for the purpose of producing that result, as the violence and ill treatment, doubtless excessive, were principally directed to extorting a confession or to the repression of an attempt at resistance, and it was only by these acts as a whole that the homicide resulted. Therefore in this case there is no starting point which permits us to determine which were the evils necessarily included in the commission of the crime, and which were only the result of a deliberate intent to increase the sufferings of the victim. (Decision of the supreme court of Spain of June 16, 1897.) <br/><br/>Dionisio Carandang did not appeal from the judgment, by which he was condemned to fourteen years and nine months of cadena temporal, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification to the full extent, and to subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the period of the penalty and for an equal period after the expiration thereof, and to pay, jointly and severally with the two other accused, the sum of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, with a third part of the costs. This part of the judgment is final. <br/><br/>With respect to the other accused, Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo Candelaria, this court applies as a mitigating circumstance the fact that they did not have, when inflicting this ill treatment, an intent to cause so great an evil as that which resulted — that is, the death of Jacinto de Jesus. This having been committed with alevosia (the alevosia. with which the deceased was illtreated), the killing must be classified as murder. Notwithstanding the presence of alevosia, as the aggravating circumstance of extreme cruelty did not concur, the accused can not be condemned to death. <br/><br/>We therefore condemn Espiridion Salunday and Timoteo Candelaria to seventeen years four months and one day of cadena temporal, with the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification in its full extent, and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during the period of the principal penalty and for an equal period thereafter, beginning from the time of the expiration thereof, and to pay, jointly and severally, to the heirs of the deceased the sum of 2,000 pesos, and to pay one-third part of the costs each, the judgment of the court below being reversed in so far as it may be in conflict herewith, and being otherwise confirmed.

The Government did not appeal from the acquittal of Magpayo. <br/><br/>The evidence against the appellants was as follows: Lorenzo Ramos, a Constabulary inspector, testified that he captured Quinto, Sinambal, and Joaquin in a banca in the Atlag River in the pueblo of Malolos, Bulacan, one night in September, 1902; that he found two sewing machines, some money, and two bolos in the banca in their possession; that they admitted they had stolen the sewing machines and the money; that Quinto gave information which led to the apprehension the same night of the other appellant, Liuanag; that they found in Liuanag’s possession a large amount of jewelry, some money, and a gun and 150 cartridges; that Liuanag confessed that a part of the jewelry had fallen to him as his share of the proceeds of robberies committed in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, Rizal, and that he had bought part of it for a small sum from the other robbers. <br/><br/>Leon de la Rosa, also an officer of the Constabulary, who was with Ramos when the arrests were made, confirms in all substantial respects the testimony of the latter. <br/><br/>The sewing machines and a part of the jewelry were brought into court and identified by their owners, who stated that they were taken from their respective houses in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, by robbers, the witnesses being in their houses at the time of the robberies. <br/><br/>Candida Garcia, the owner of some of the jewelry and one of the sewing machines, testified that the robbers who attacked her house on the occasion when this property was taken were five in number, all armed. None of these witnesses give the date of these robberies, but they all state that they were committed in the nighttime. <br/><br/>No witnesses were introduced by the defense. <br/><br/>The evidence leaves no room for doubt that the appellants belonged to an armed band of outlaws, who committed various robberies in the barrio of Dampalit, pueblo of Malabon, Rizal, on a night just previous to the time of their arrest in September, 1902. The evidence of Candida Garcia shows that the band numbered at least five. All the elements of the crime of robo en cuadrilla are established, and the conviction was right. <br/><br/>The court below should, however, have appreciated the aggravating circumstances of Nos. 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Code, and should consequently have applied the penalty in the maximum degree. We fix the penalty at ten years of presidio mayor, modifying the judgment in this respect and affirming it in all other respects, and the cause will be returned to the court below for the execution of the same. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">That the deceased, Rufino Dizon, was creating a disturbance in front of the store of Alejandro Guevara, and that the defendant, a policeman, attempted to arrest him and take him to the presidencia and that he declined to go, was clearly proved. We think that it was also proved that the deceased did not content himself with a passive resistance, but carried it to the extent of attacking the defendant. The defendant himself so testifies, and his testimony is corroborated by that of said Alejandro Guevara. The latter says that he intervened between the two men in order to separate them and that the defendant’s revolver was discharged almost in his face. If the resistance of Dizon had been passive, Guevara could hardly have intervened, for fear that he himself might be arrested for interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty. His intervention can be explained only on the theory that the deceased was making an attack on the defendant. We accordingly hold that the proof shows an unlawful aggression on the part of the former. It was also shown that there was no provocation moving from the defendant. <br/><br/>The complete defense of article 8, No. 4, of the Penal Code, is, however, not made out because the second requirement thereof was not proved. When the defendant fired his revolver and killed Dizon the latter, according to the defendant’s own testimony, had already struck twice at him with a calicut. The character of this weapon is such that in our opinion the defendant could not then have reasonably believed that it was necessary to kill his assailant in order to repel the attack. <br/><br/>The incomplete defense is, however, made out, and, applying article 86 of the Penal Code, we revoke the judgment of the court below in respect to the penalty and fix the same at six years and of day of prision mayor. In other respects the judgment, so far as it is not inconsistent with this opinion, is hereby confirmed, with costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The conclusion reached by the court below with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence as to the commission of the act charged, and the guilt of the defendants as principals, is in conformity with the law. The offense has been properly classified in the judgment as that of robbery with homicide, defined and punished in section 1 of article 503 of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The judge has imposed upon the defendants the penalty of death, considering the concurrence, in the commission of the crime, of the aggravating circumstances of alevosia, premeditation, and the perpetration of the offense in an uninhabited place. We can not concur in this conclusion. No witness was present at the commission of the crime, and therefore no one can testify from his own knowledge as to the manner and form in which the crime was committed. These data being absent, there is no foundation upon which to rest the circumstance of alevosia, which is, in its essential characteristics, a modifying condition in the commission of the crime. It can not even be presumed that the defendants tied the hands of the deceased — and this is apparently the fact upon which the judge relied for the purpose of considering that this circumstance was present — because the vague indications which appear in the record to have been made upon this point as a mere matter of hearsay are overcome by the certain and unquestionable fact that the deceased crawled on his hands and knees some 300 meters from the place where the crime was committed to the police station, where he was found wounded by the people of the barrio in which the crime occurred. This proves positively that his hands were free and not tied. This conclusion is corroborated by the circumstance that none of the various witnesses who saw him in the station could testify to the contrary at the trial. <br/><br/>With respect to premeditation, there are no data whatever to show when the idea of killing and robbing the deceased first arose in the minds of the accused. This idea might well have occurred to them at the very moment they met him in the place where the crime was committed. This meeting, in accordance with all conjectures possible upon the record of the case, was casual, and therefore it can not be affirmed, because of the lack of any evidence, that the commission of the crime was preceded by a reflexive and premeditated purpose or intent, this being precisely what constitutes premeditation. In consequence, we hold that this circumstance did not exist in this case. <br/><br/>With respect to the circumstance of the commission of the crime in an uninhabited place, we do not find this circumstance sufficiently proven in the case, in consideration of the fact that a short distance from the place where the crime was committed there was a station, the precise purpose of which was to serve as a shelter for the peace officers of the town. On the other hand, it does not appear that when the offense in the case at bar was committed there were no watchmen at the station; therefore it can not be said, strictly speaking, that the place in question was an uninhabited, solitary place, and that its isolation made it easy to commit the crime with impunity. This is the very element upon which rests the increased responsibility for crimes committed in uninhabited places. <br/><br/>There being no aggravating circumstance which can be considered to have concurred in the commission of the crime, the accused should be convicted, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph of article 80 of the Penal Code, to suffer the lesser of the two indivisible penalties prescribed by paragraph 1 of article 503, which, as we have already stated is the one applicable to the case. <br/><br/>We therefore condemn the accused to the penalty of life imprisonment (cadena perpetua) and to the payment of the sum of 500 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased. The judgment of the court below, so  modified, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the defendants.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">One morning in the month of January, 1899, as alleged in the complaint upon which this prosecution was instituted, Hermogenes Languido was attacked in the barrio of Tuyong, in the town of Carcar, by the accused, Vicente and Antero Regis, who inflicted five wounds upon him in various parts of the body with sharp weapons. In consequence of the wounds Languido died on February 2 following in the municipal building of said town, to which he was taken immediately after the attack. On the 13th of June, 1902, a complaint was filed by the widow of the deceased charging the accused with the crime of homicide. <br/><br/>The widow of the deceased, Don Florencio Noel, the municipal president of Carcar, Adriano Enriquez, the officer of justice, and Doroteo Tanodtanod, Domingo Caballero, Macario Cantuaneo, and Benito Bolocboloc were examined as witnesses. From their testimony it appears that Hermogenes Languido was wounded by the accused. No person was an eyewitness to the attack except Domingo Caballero, who affirms that, from a distance of some 10 brazas, he saw the accused attack Hermogenes Languido with small swords, the latter being unarmed. The witness Tanodtanod, when he approached the window of his house, attracted by the cries of the wounded man, saw him already stretched wounded on the ground, and by his side the two armed aggressors. All testified that the wounds suffered by the deceased were severe and dangerous, and that in consequence thereof Languido died on the fifteenth day thereafter. Cantuanco testifies that, according to Antero Regis, with whom he had some conversation, Languido was wounded because he had resisted, although he did not state who was the first to make the attack. <br/><br/>Mariano Ganaria, an herb doctor who attended the wounded man, testified that the five wounds received by Hermogenes were beginning to improve when, two days before his death, he was attacked by a diarrhea, accompanied by hemorrhages and mucous discharges, which resulted in his death. The witness added that the wounds were not necessarily mortal, and that no one of them could have caused death, as, had the wounds been mortal, the man would not have lived for fifteen days, but would have died immediately; that when he died the wounds were already beginning to heal, and that, had it not been for the diarrhea, he would have been well in a month or two; that upon his recovery he would have been able to use his arms, but would have shown scars on his face; and that, at the time of his death, blood and matter were exuding from the wounds on the calves of his legs. <br/><br/>The violent death of Hermogenes Languido is a fact fully proven in this case, and constitutes the crime of homicide, as charged by the complaining witness and as defined in article 404 of the Penal Code. Even admitting that two days before the death of the wounded man he was attacked by diarrhea, the character and origin of this diarrhea not having been shown, it is reasonable to believe that it was incidental to the serious condition in which Hermogenes was at that time. He must undoubtedly have been very weak, by reason of the considerable loss of blood suffered as a result of his five wounds. Therefore, an attack of diarrhea, whatever may have caused it, must necessarily have been fatal to the patient, in view of the serious condition of his wounds, which, together with the diarrhea, undoubtedly caused his death. <br/><br/>His demise, therefore, is not due solely to this cause. This conclusion is supported by the testimony of the physicians who were examined upon this subject as witnesses. They testified that the diarrhea, not being the result of cholera, might be said to have originated from the debility and prostrated condition of the patient, and could be regarded as a complication of the wounds inflicted upon him. It is to be observed, moreover, that Placida Labices, the wife of the deceased, testified that the latter had contracted no illness other than the wounds, and that he died from the result of the latter. <br/><br/>The accused, Antero and Vicente Regis, pleaded not guilty to the crime with which they are charged. Vicente testified that one day in the month of January, 1899, he ordered Hermogenes Languido, his tenant, to go to work as a fireman at the sugarhouse; that when the witness reached his warehouse he found a considerable amount of juice uncooked, because, according to the statements made by the other laborers, the fireman Languido had not arrived. The witness immediately began to look for him, and finding him in the warehouse asked him why he had not gone to work. Hermogenes replied that he was not obliged to do so, whereupon the witness said he would lay the matter before the authorities; that thereupon Languido attempted to attack him with a bolo which he had in his hand, and the witness, warding off the blow, fought with his aggressor and succeeded in taking the weapon from him; that, as the struggle continued, fearing that Languido might again possess himself of the weapon, he struck the latter with the bolo which he had seized from him, and inflicted upon him several wounds, until he fell to the ground; and that at this time the father of the accused, Antero Regis, arrived on the scene, he having been some 15 or 20 brazas away when this occurred. <br/><br/>Antero Regis corroborates the testimony of his son Vicente, for whom he says he was looking, not having found him in the warehouse; that the laborers told him that his son Vicente had gone to look for Hermogenes Languido; that he shortly after heard what had occurred, and saw Languido stretched on the ground, wounded, and that he immediately went to the municipal tribunal to report to the authorities what had occurred. Two other witnesses, Hugo Lauas and Julio Naviches, the latter a brother-in-law of the deceased, testified that Languido endeavored to attack Regis, who, in view of the former’s attitude, seized him by the hand, and that a struggle then ensued, Vicente Regis being at that time unarmed. <br/><br/>There having been no eyewitnesses to the beginning of the struggle, and, accepting the confession and exculpative allegations of Vicente Regis as true, upon the whole merits of the case we must regard him as the principal by direct participation in the homicide of Hermogenes Languido. This decision is not affected by the fact that the deceased did not die immediately after receiving the wounds, but on the fifteenth day afterwards, and in consequence of a complication of diarrhea, as testified to by the herb doctor who attended him, inasmuch as the accused is responsible before the law for the act committed and for all its consequences, if there be no evidence — and there is none in this case — that such consequences were due to an extraneous cause. Consequently Vicente Regis must be regarded as having committed the offense of homicide, and not that of lesiones. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, we must consider, in favor of the accused, the special circumstance of complete exemption from criminal responsibility, in view of his testimony, uncontradicted by that of any witness for the complainants and corroborated by the witnesses for the defense, inasmuch as there were both an unlawful aggression and lack of provocation on his part, two of the requisites assigned by section 4, article 8, of the Code. <br/><br/>The second point is, in our opinion, also proven. This case is very similar to two others just decided by this court — The United States v. Bernardo Patala, December 11, 1901, and the United States v. Juan Salandanan, November 13, 1902. 1 <br/><br/>With respect to the other accused, Antero Regis, it not expressly appearing that the provincial fiscal or counsel for the complaining witness has appealed from the judgment of acquittal in his favor, this part of the judgment of the court below is regarded as final. <br/><br/>In view of these considerations, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and the accused, Vicente Regis, is acquitted, with costs de oficio. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Upon the statement of facts and conclusions of law relative to the actual commission of the crime of homicide, and the culpability of the accused, Vicente Regis, as expressed in the preceding opinion, and with respect to which the undersigned concurs, he nevertheless dissents from the opinion of the majority of the court with respect to the existence of the circumstance of complete exemption from criminal responsibility for the commission of the crime. <br/><br/>The exemption from responsibility which should be considered in favor of the accused Vicente Regis is incomplete, judging from the merits of the case, because only two of the three requisites established by section 4, article 8, of the Penal Code are present; that is, illegal aggression and lack of provocation on the part of the accused. It can not, however, be said that in the alleged defense he employed a reasonable means of repelling or impeding the aggression, inasmuch as, in the opinion of the undersigned, Vicente Regis exceeded the necessities of the defense. Once having possessed himself of the weapon with which the deceased was attacking him, there was no reasonable necessity for the infliction of five serious wounds in order to impede or repel an aggression no longer continued, or which, even if continued, could no longer be effective, inasmuch as Hermogenes Languido was already disarmed. <br/><br/>From this point of view, and by reason of the absence of the second of the necessary elements, the act committed by Vicente Regis is not excusable, and in accordance with the provisions of article 86 of the Penal Code should be punished, in the opinion of the writer, by a penalty inferior by two degrees to that assigned by article 404 of the Code; that is, the medium grade of the penalty of correctional imprisonment. In view, then, of this consideration, it is the opinion of the writer that the judgment appealed should be reversed, and that it should be held (1) that the facts proved in this case constitute the crime of homicide; (2) that Vicente Regis is guilty of that crime, as principal, and that in his favor should be considered the existence of the special circumstance of incomplete exemption referred to by article 86 of the Penal Code; (3) that the said accused should be punished by the infliction of the medium grade of the penalty two degrees inferior to that assigned for the offense by article 404 of the Penal Code — that is, the penalty of correctional imprisonment and the accessories of article 61 — and (4) that he has also incurred a civil responsibility, and should suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and should be taxed with the costs. <br/><br/>Consequently the writer is of the opinion that the accused, Vicente Regis, should be convicted and sentenced to four years’ correctional imprisonment, the payment of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of the deceased, Hermogenes Languido, and, in case of insolvency, should suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, the latter not to exceed one year, and to the payment of one-half of the costs of the Court of First Instance and all the costs of this instance. <br/><br/><p align=\"justify\"><em><strong><font color=\"#990000\">Endnotes:</font></strong></em></p><blockquote><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"/><br/>1. 1 Phil.

From this judgment he appeals. <br/><br/>John Douglas, a witness for the prosecution, testified that he was deputy treasurer of the Province of Pangasinan, and as such was sent to check up the cash and the accounts of the defendant as treasurer of Rosales. That he arrived at Rosales about 5 o’clock in the afternoon and immediately proceeded to make an examination of the municipal safe then in charge of the defendant; that he started to count the cash and before he had finished the defendant stopped him, saying,  \"Wait a minute; I gave my brother a check for $166.66 to have it cashed in Lingayen, but he has not returned the check or its equivalent in cash;\" that in the presence of the defendant he proceeded to finish counting the cash and found $1,155.01; that he did not open any of the packages Which were marked as containing certain amounts because it was getting dark, and he arranged with the defendant that the count should be made the next morning at the presidencia, at which time the defendant promised to produce the cashbook pertaining to his office; that on leaving the presidencia that evening he locked and sealed the cash box after placing the money back in the box; that the cash box was not again opened until the 4th of February, when he opened it for the purpose of cashing a school-teacher’s check of $174.90; that he took this amount front the safe and replaced the money with this check; that he then locked and sealed up the safe and did not open it again until the 10th day of February. That the defendant left Rosales the next morning after his arrival about 7 o’clock, and never appeared, as promised, to make the count of the money contained in the safe or to produce his books That on the 10th day of February the witness recounted the money in the presence of other parties, the defendant not being present That on this counting of the money the witness found $1,033 contained in the safe. That he opened the packages which were said to contain $40, and found some half pesos mixed in with the pesos in such a way that many of the packages had the appearance of containing $40 each, when in fact they contained less; that the discrepancy between the count made on the 1st day of February of $1,155.01 and that made at this date, to wit, $1,033, was due to the fact that the packages did not contain the full amount represented. That at this time he actually counted the money, peso by peso, and knows that this counting was correctly done Previous to making the last count of the money he had examined the books of the defendant and found that there should have been $1,303 in the cash box; that two native teachers presented themselves to him, while he was in charge of the office, requesting payment of $30 and $20, respectively, which appeared from the books of the treasurer as having been paid, but which, as stated by them, was never received The difference between the amount shown to be due on the books of the treasurer, to w it, the sum of $1,303.40 and the amount of $1,033, as found in Cash in the safe, is a difference of $270.40; that adding the $50 shown on the books of the treasurer as paid to the two native teachers, but which was paid by the witness, brought the difference up to $320.40<br/><br/>The witness Douglas also testified that between the 10th of February, the date on which he made the last count of the money, and the 23d day of February, the date on which he again locked and sealed the safe and turned the key over to the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan, he was in possession of the safe and made various collections due the office of the municipal treasurer of Rosales amounting to the sum of $64. This sum, together with the amount of $1,033, was the amount in the safe on the 23d day of February, when he sealed and locked it, and turned the key over to the provincial treasurer This was substantially the proof of the Government. <br/><br/>The defendant introduced evidence to show that between the 1st day of February and the date of Douglas’s leaving Rosales, to wit, the 23d day of February, he requested Douglas several times, through other parties, to make a recount of the money and to give kiln an inventory of the property received from him. This, according to the testimony of defendant’s witnesses, Douglas refused to do. <br/><br/>There were discrepancies on many immaterial points in the case and some proof offered tending to show that the safe was not sealed and locked for the entire time between the 1st of February and the 10th of February, the respective dates on which the witness Douglas made a count of the money. <br/><br/>The case was tried and the defendant was sentenced on the 28th day of May, 1902. <br/><br/>On the 27th day of August, 1902, the case then being on appeal in this court, the defendant moved this court for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. This motion is supported by notarial act of date the 9th day of June, 1902, in which act it is stated that the treasurer who was appointed as successor to defendant took possession of the safe on the 9th day of June and in the presence of several persons then Counted the money, and that the amount found in the safe on this counting was the sum of $1,348.23, which exceeded by $6.55 the amount shown to be due from the defendant to the municipality by the books of the treasurer, after deducting the $64 placed in the safe by Douglas; that at the time of opening the safe the seal appeared to be unbroken. <br/><br/>The motion does not state that the safe was not in charge of the defendant after the 1st day of February, the date on which he was removed from the office and possession was taken by the witness Douglas, nor was there any proof tending to show that the defendant had access to the safe, nor that any other person had Such access other than the witness Douglas or the provincial treasurer who was in possession of the keys. <br/><br/>In view of the fact that the defendant did not have the power to make the examination after the safe left his possession up to the date of his trial, we think it just and proper that he should have an opportunity of presenting the proof as to what the safe contained when delivered on the 9th of June to his successor. <br/><br/>The Government will also have the opportunity of showing, if it can be done, that the seal of the safe had been broken, or such circumstances as will prove that the safe was accessible to the defendant or to other persons from the 23d day of February up to the date of the opening of the safe on the 9th day of June. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is set aside and a new trial awarded in the Court of First Instance. The testimony in the case to the effect that the defendant s books contained an entry showing that the sums of $20 and $30, respectively, had been paid to the two native teachers, when in fact no such payments had been made, if substantiated, would show the defendant to be guilty of a greater offense than that charged in the complaint, to wit, that of the falsification of an official document, defined and punished under article 301 in connection with article 301 of the Penal Code<br/><br/>The judgment is reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD and LADD, <em>JJ.</em>, concurring in the results of this opinion:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>It was plainly proved in this case by the testimony of Douglas that he went to Rosales for the purpose of removing the defendant from his office of municipal treasurer He carried with him an order from the provincial treasurer for such removal, delivered it to the defendant as soon as he arrived at Rosales, and demanded and then received from the defendant the key to the safe The defendant was not removed because of any irregularity in his accounts, but, as Douglas testified because he had kept the municipal safe in a place other than the presidencia Douglas testified also that he had examined the accounts on the 7th of January preceding, and found them correct Douglas took possession of the safe, not for the purpose of examining the accounts lout because the treasurer had been removed. <br/><br/>Four witnesses for the defendant testified that they were present when Douglas removed the defendant from office and received the key, and that the defendant then demanded that Douglas count the cash and make an inventory of the property then turned over to him, and that Douglas refused to do it. <br/><br/>Miller, an American school-teacher, a witness for the Government, testified that the defendant on the day that he was removed from office came to him and begged aim to get Douglas to recount the money The witness asked Douglas to do this and the latter refused. <br/><br/>The justice of the peace testified that five or six days after his (the defendant’s) removal from office, the defendant came to him and asked him to intercede with the commander of the American troops. there stationed in order to get Douglas to recount the money and make an inventory. <br/><br/>It is proved that Douglas never made an inventory of the property turned over to him by the defendant, and never gave the defendant any kind of a receipt for anything which he received from him. Douglas admitted that he never even informed the defendant of the exact amount of the deficit claimed by him, and when he first saw the defendant after its alleged discovery he never mentioned it. <br/><br/>The circumstances relating to the charge of falsification in connection with the payment of the two school-teachers rest entirely upon the testimony of Douglas, and even his testimony does not indicate that the defendant personally made any false entries in his books. I do not think the evidence of Douglas sufficient to warrant any prosecution against the defendant for falsification. <br/><br/>I agree that a new trial should be granted. </div>'\n",

It may be said, judging from the result of other cases referred to by the prosecuting attorney, that this society had for its purpose the preparation of a new revolution against the Government of the United States in these Islands. <br/><br/>Act No. 518 was passed on November 12, 1902. As this act is not retroactive it can not be applied to those engaged in brigand age prior to that date, and if, as Diaz confessed on November 27, 1902, he accepted the office of vice-president a little less than a month before, and regarding this statement, the only evidence against hint, as true, it follows that his appointment was prior in date to the law referred to, and the crime committed was therefore subject at that time to the provisions of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>The record contains no evidence to show that Leandro Diaz was a member of a band of brigands engaged or about to engage in acts prohibited and punished by said Act No 518. He can not, therefore, be found guilty of the crime of brigandage, and, in our judgment, must be acquitted, as were the other defendants, Pioson and Leongsong. <br/><br/>Therefore, for the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below with respect to the appellant Leandro Diaz should he reversed and the latter acquitted, with the costs of both instances de oficio. Upon the filing of an information for the crime of insurrection, sedition, and conspiracy, defined and punished by Act No. 292, the judge will take action against the three defendants in accordance with the law. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The complaint charges the defendant with the offense of aiding and abetting a band of brigands by supplying them with food. (Act No. 518, sec. 4). Upon being arraigned in the Court of First Instance, the defendant, who had no counsel, having elected to defend himself, stated that the facts charged in the complaint were true, but that he supplied the brigands with food through fear that if he did not do so they would kill him. Without hearing any evidence, the court thereupon found the defendant guilty, and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. <br/><br/>What the defendant stated when arraigned amounted to a denial of criminal responsibility, based on facts which, he conceived, constituted a lawful excuse for his conduct. It was virtually a plea of not guilty. (See United States v. Padilla, decided November 18, 1902.) It is quite apparent that the court regarded it as a plea of guilty, and for this error the cause must be sent back for a new trial. <br/><br/>The place where the alleged crime was committed is not stated in the complaint. This defect should be supplied by amendment. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause returned to that court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendants have been convicted of rebellion, under section 3 of Act No. 292 of the Commission. The information is very loosely drawn, but we think it sufficiently charges the crime of insurrection or rebellion. It so designates the crime charged, and it contains language which may fairly be construed as an allegation that the defendants incited and set on foot a rebellion against the authority of the United States in the Philippine Islands, which is the definition of the crime given by the statute. If the information could be regarded as defective in not stating facts which constitute the clime of rebellion, yet, as it specifically designates that crime as the one charged, and as we think the evidence shows the commission of that crime, and as no objection was taken to the information either in the court below or in this court, we are of opinion that the conviction should be sustained. <br/><br/>Taking the admissions made by the defendants at the trial in connection with the documentary evidence introduced by the prosecution, it is clearly shown that on July 5, 1902, the day of the defendants arrest, they were members of the society known as the Katipunan, as reconstituted by them and others in December, 1901; that this society had for its object the forcible overthrow of the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands; that it had established what purported to be a Tagalog government of the Archipelago, of which government the defendants were high officials; that it had organized what purported to be an army; and that during a period extending from December, 1901, down to a date subsequent to May 1, 1902, its leaders, including the defendants, were actively engaged in plotting and organizing insurrectionary movements. These facts are sufficient to support the conviction. <br/><br/>The appellants claimed at the trial that they could not be convicted of the crime of rebellion, because they had never recognized the Government of the United States in these Islands, or taken the oath of allegiance thereto. Their counsel in this court has not insisted upon this defense, and it is so palpably unfounded — being nothing less than a negation of the right of the Government to maintain its existence and authority against a certain class of the population — that we do not think it necessary to discuss it. <br/><br/>The only question raised by counsel in this court is as to the sentence. The crime is punishable by imprisonment for not more than ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000. (Act No. 292, sec. 3.) The court imposed a fine of $5,500 and the maximum of the penalty of imprisonment, without, however, finding the existence of any aggravating circumstance. It is claimed that the penalty of imprisonment fixed for the crime must be divided into grades, and, in the absence of either aggravating or extenuating circumstances, should be applied in the present case in the medium grade, in accordance with the rules of the Spanish Penal Code. <br/><br/>We are of opinion that the rules of the Penal Code with reference to the circumstances which aggravate and extenuate guilt, and with reference to the application of penalties as affected by the existence or nonexistence of such circumstances, are not applicable to the penal legislation of the commission. Those rules form a part of a complicated and carefully adjusted system of penalties, and can not be conveniently applied, and in many cases can not be applied at all, except in relation with other parts of such system. They are entirely foreign to the spirit of American criminal legislation, which allows wide discretion to the judge in the fixing of penalties. In the absence of anything in Act No. 292 to indicate that the Commission intended that the penalties therein prescribed should he applied by the courts in accordance with the rules of the Penal Code, we can not presume that such was their intention. <br/><br/>The discretion possessed by the judge as to the penalty was, we think, in the present case, properly exercised. <br/><br/>Application was made by the defendants in the court below for the benefits of the amnesty proclamation of July 4, 1902. Counsel in this court has not renewed this application. The defendants are not within the terms of the amnesty proclamation, because the crime of which they have been convicted was committed subsequent to May 1, 1902. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, and the cause will be returned to that court for the execution of such judgment. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. </div>'\n",

One Marcelino San Pedro and certain other individuals had been arrested upon suspicion of being concerned in an insurrectionary conspiracy in Pasig, and it was supposed that San Pedro had in his possession or under his control arms, ammunition, money, and supplies which had been collected for the purposes of the movement. An investigation was accordingly instituted at the police station, and, in the course thereof, San Pedro having denied all knowledge as to the conspiracy, the defendant, for the purpose of compelling him to disclose the w hereabouts of the arms, struck him several times with a whip, drawing blood, as we think the evidence shows, but not injuring him so severely as to incapacitate him from working or to necessitate medical attendance. <br/><br/>Nothing was shown by the defense which can constitute a justification or excuse for the assault. <br/><br/>The complaint was for lesiones menos graves under article 418 of the Code.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">At 7 a. m. one Saturday in the month of September, 1902 — the precise date can not be ascertained — Epifanio Laserna and Pedro Artista were walking along near the dividing line between the barrio of San Fernando, of the town of Santo Tomas, Batangas, and that of San Yldefonso, of the town of Alaminos, La Laguna, but still in the Province of Batangas, on their way home from San Pablo to Taal, of which town they were residents. At this point they were met by some seven men, who came out of the neighboring forest, one of them armed with a ride, another with a revolver, and the others with long bolos. These men, by violence and intimidation, seized the five horses, which were loaded with wine, oil, saddles, hats, handkerchiefs, and other goods, and also a ten-dollar bill which Laserna had with him. Laserna was taken by the robbers into the forest and tied to a tree, and then abandoned by them in this condition. He remained there until the return of his companion, Pedro Artista, who had succeeded in escaping from the thieves, and who then released Laserna. Laserna’s three horses were worth $210, and Artista’s two horses $180. <br/><br/>The facts related constitute the crime of robbery in a band defined and punished by article 502, paragraph 5 of article 503, and article 504 of the Penal Code. Seven armed men deprived the complaining witnesses by violence and intimidation of the five horses and the ten-dollar bank note and of the goods they were carrying. This circumstance qualifies the robbery, as the number of thieves was sufficient to constitute a band. The crime was committed in an unpopulated place in the barrio of San Yldefonso, in the Province of Batangas, in the neighborhood of a forest. It does not appear that the complaining witnesses were wounded. <br/><br/>The five defendants plead not guilty. Although they denied that they participated in the commission of the crime charged against them in the information, the record contains evidence which is conclusive as to their guilt, when considered as a whole in accordance with the rules of a sound discretion, and fully convinces the mind of the guilt of each one of the five defendants. <br/><br/>The record discloses the fact that the accused were identified by the two complaining witnesses among several other prisoners. The complainants in their testimony state that they remember the appearance of the malefactors who robbed them. The complaining witnesses also identified the gun which was taken by the officers from the defendants after their arrest, and which was found at a place designated by some of them. <br/><br/>It also appears from the record that late on the night of September 30 a search was made in the house of Agapito Millar by order of the, officer who was investigating the crime. Agapito was asked if any persons lived with him in the house, to which he replied that he lived there alone. However, the chief of police, Manuel Villanueva, saw indications that there were more people in the house, proceeded to search it, and found the other accused, Angel de Villa, hidden under the stove. Agapito Millar and Angel de Villa were arrested, taken from the house, and held in the street while the search continued. While there they confessed to the two policemen, Benito Carpio and Urbano Marvive, who were watching them and who had questioned them about the robbery, that they were the persons who had committed the crime. Agapito and Angel also designated the other accused persons, Teodorico Millar and Ambrosio Malijan, as their companions in the commission of the crime, and upon this accusation they were arrested. Later Ambrosio Malijan also designated Guillermo Maza as another of his companions, and upon this information Maza was arrested, but Mariano Malijan and Aniceto Carpio, also accused by Ambrosio, could not be found. Agapito, Angel, and Teodorico pointed out where the gun was hidden in the San Isidro forest, which gun, according to the testimony of the complainants, was the one carried by a man they identified and who turned out to be Guillermo Maza. The five horses were also recovered by the police, who found them hidden in the interior of the forest of the said barrio near the house of Agapito, the latter and Angel having stated where the horses were to be found. <br/><br/>All these facts, fully proven, constitute conclusive evidence of the guilt of the five defendants. This evidence for the prosecution has not been weakened or overcome by the  alibi testimony introduced by the defense, inasmuch as the date of the commission of the crime and that on which the accused said they remained home have not been proven, and more especially in view of the relative proximity of the residences of the accused to the place of the robbery. <br/><br/>The record does not disclose the slightest proof that the confession made by a majority of the accused to the policemen, and to the justice of the peace, was extorted by violence and coercion. On the other hand, the finding of the goods, the horses, and the other property stolen was due to the admissions and statements of some of the defendants — the very ones who pointed out their codelinquents. Therefore, they having been identified by the complaining witnesses, as well as the gun carried by Maza, it is unquestionable that the five accused, together with the two absentees who have not been arrested, were the authors by direct participation of the crime of robbery in a band as herein prosecuted. <br/><br/>In the perpetration of the crime no generic circumstance, mitigating or aggravating, can be regarded as present, and therefore the penalty prescribed by article 504, by reason of the existence of the qualifying circumstance of the commission of the offense in a band, should be imposed in the medium period of the maximum degree, under paragraph 5 of article 503, as to all the defendants, inasmuch as it does not appear which one of them was the leader. <br/><br/>With respect to the defects which the defense alleges are to be found in the information, the proceedings at the trial, and the judgment appealed, some of them are already refuted by the preceding statements, and, with respect to the others, the information only charges one crime, committed in the territory of the Province of Batangas. The jurisdiction of that court is unquestionable. The court, by its deputy, received the complaint with respect to the crime, and subsequently took cognizance thereof, in accordance with the law. An officer who has taken an oath of office, as has the clerk of the court who acted as interpreter in this case, need not repeat the oath nor be sworn as an interpreter every time he acts as such in the discharge of his duties. <br/><br/>Furthermore, these objections were not made in the court below in the course of the trial, and the failure to do so must be regarded as another reason for overruling them in the appellate court. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated we are of the opinion, therefore, that the judgment appealed must be affirmed in so far as the five defendants, Angel de Villa, Agapito Millar, Teodorico Millar, Ambrosio Malijan, and Guillermo Maza, are thereby convicted and condemned to eight years and one day of presidio mayor, and in addition to suffer the accessories of absolute temporary disqualification to the full extent and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities for a period equal to the principal penalty, to be counted from the time of the expiration of the same, and each to pay one-fifth part of the costs of both instances, to restore the bank note and goods not recovered or to pay the value of the same, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, by reason of the character of the principal penalty imposed. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

Antonio Enriquez y Sequera, and that in the year 1897 D. Rafael Enriquez was substituted in his stead as such administrator. <br/><br/>That on the 31st day of December, 1902, the Hon. Arthur F Odlin, one of the judges of the Court of First Instance entered an order in the administration proceedings directing petitioner to render an account of his administration. <br/><br/>That on the 20th day of February, 1903, the judge of the Court of First Instance made an order reciting that the petitioner had refused to obey the order of the court of the 31st of December, 1902, and the petitioner was cited to appear before the court to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt in disobeying the order; that on the 2d day of March, 1903, the contempt proceedings coming on to be heard, the Court of First Instance entered an order finding the petitioner guilty of contempt and directing him to be imprisoned in Bilibid for the period of six months or until he should produce the account in question, or until the further orders of this court. That, immediately after the announcement of this judgment the plaintiff appealed against the same and executed a bond to the satisfaction of the court for the sum of $5,000, conditioned as required by law. That after the filing of said appeal bond the petitioner was again cited to appear on the 3d day of March, 1903, for further proceedings with reference to the enforcement of the order for contempt. That the petitioner believes and alleges that it is the purpose of the judge of the Court of First Instance to carry into execution the  said sentence notwithstanding the appeal interposed and the execution of the appeal bond; that by reason of the execution of the appeal bond the Court of First Instance lost its jurisdiction, and the petitioner prays this court that the judge of the Court of First Instance be prohibited from taking further proceedings in the Matter until the decision of the appeal and the further order of the Supreme Court. <br/><br/>Section 240 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1901, upon the construction of which depends the decision of this case, reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The judgment and orders of a Court of First Instance, made in cases of contempt, except in eases arising under section 231, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court; but execution of the judgment and orders shall not be suspended until there is filed by the person in contempt, in the court rendering the judgment of making the order, an obligation with sureties to the acceptance of the judge, in an amount to be by him fixed, and conditioned that if judgment be against him, he will abide and perform the order of judgment. But such review shall be had only after final judgment in the action in the Court of First Instance, and when the cause was regularly passed to the Supreme Court by bill of exceptions, as in this act provided.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>This being a demurrer to the petition, all of the allegations must be taken as true. From these allegations it appears that, after the entry of judgment for contempt by the Court of First Instance, the petitioner took an appeal to this court, and that he has executed a bond, with sureties, conditioned as required by law, which has been accepted by the judge. <br/><br/>It is contended by the respondent that by the terms of the statute an appeal can be taken only after final judgment in the Court of First Instance, and when the cause has been regularly passed to the Supreme Court by bill of exceptions; that the order of the Court of First Instance directing the appellant, Francisco Enriquez, to render an account, being in favor of the heirs of the estate, they have no cause to appeal the case; that as no final judgment can be entered in the administration proceedings, the provisions of section 240 regulating the appeal is not applicable to this character of case, and that the execution of the judgment for contempt should not be suspended. <br/><br/>The section unquestionably confers the right of appeal upon a party against whom a judgment for contempt of court has been rendered. The appeal has been taken and a bond has been executed in strict compliance with the requirements of the statute. The right to an appeal can not be construed away, by holding that the party is not entitled to appeal until final judgment in the principal action, and that where no final judgment is contemplated an appeal from a contempt proceeding can not be allowed. <br/><br/>If it is a case where no final judgment is to be made, then the party against whom the judgment is rendered in the contempt proceedings must be entitled to perfect his appeal without awaiting further proceedings. <br/><br/>The intention of the statute in requiring that the appeal from the contempt proceedings should await final judgment in the principal case was to prevent different appeals from the two judgments in the same proceedings, and its purpose was to postpone the appeal in the contempt case until the principal case came up on a final judgment. <br/><br/>If the proceedings were such that there was to be no final judgment entered in the case, then there would be no reason why the appeal from the contempt proceedings should not be perfected and brought up at once. The phrase in question is perhaps susceptible to still another construction. <br/><br/>In ordinary actions the case is appealed to this court by bill of exceptions, while in special proceedings cases are brought here by the distinctive method of appeal. In a case brought here by bill of exceptions no appeal can be taken until a final judgment has been rendered; while in special proceedings appeals may be taken at various stages of the proceedings. Appeals are allowed to any person legally interested in any order, decree, or judgment of the Court of First Instance in the exercise of its jurisdiction in special proceedings, in the settlement of estates of deceased persons, when such order, decree, or judgment constitutes a final determination of the rights of the parties so appealing. <br/><br/>However this may be, the party against whom the judgment in contempt proceedings has been entered is undoubtedly entitled to an appeal and review of the judgment. <br/><br/>By filing the appeal bond the judgment must be suspended. The statute expressly declares that this shall be the effect of filing the appeal bond. It is unimportant whether the jurisdiction of this court has attached or not. The Court of First Instance has been deprived of its power to take further action on the judgment for contempt. <br/><br/>In the event that the appeal is regarded as perfected to this court, the lower court would be acting without jurisdiction. Should this not be the case and the Court of First Instance still retains the jurisdiction of the principal suit, the attempt to enforce the judgment for contempt after the filing of the bond would be to proceed in excess of jurisdiction. <br/><br/>For these reasons the demurrer to the petition must be overruled. <br/><br/>In support of the motion to dissolve the injunction it is contended by the respondent in the case, that an injunction will not lie against a judge of a court; that it is a writ which can be used only against the parties to the proceedings. <br/><br/>This court in construing section 222 relating to mandamus, and section 226 relating to prohibition, has held that suits of this character are to be regarded as ordinary suits; that the complaint must be filed and the ordinary citation issue thereon as in ordinary suits; that the parties, in case of emergency, can avail themselves of section 230, which relates to expediting such proceedings, and also to the provisions of section 229, which relates to preliminary injunctions in <em>certiorari</em>, mandate, and prohibition proceedings. <br/><br/>The writer did not concur in these decisions, but regarded mandamus and prohibition as suits of a summary character and requiring such speedy action upon the part of the court as to avoid the necessity for resorting to the provisions of sections 229 and 230. <br/><br/>The decisions in these cases have settled the practice in favor of regarding the mandamus and prohibition as ordinary actions to be aided by the provisions of sections 229 and 230. <br/><br/>Under this construction, whether the preliminary injunction provided for in this section may be strictly in accordance with the idea of an injunction in other jurisdictions, it must be regarded here as an aid or adjunct to the remedy of prohibition by which further proceedings by an inferior court will be suspended. <br/><br/>The demurrer to the petition and the motion to dissolve the injunction must both be overruled, and it is so ordered and adjudged. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

Ambler, judge of the Court of First Instance , for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, and states in his application that he is unlawfully detained and imprisoned by George N. Wolfe, Warden of Bilibid Prison, in the city of Manila. <br/><br/>On the 5th day of January, 1898, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the Spanish authorities to two years’ imprisonment for the crime of desertion form the Spanish army. He made his escape on the 18th day of October, 1898, and was rearrested on the 20th day of January, 1903. <br/><br/>The answer to the petition and the commitment show that the prisoner had been sentenced by ordinary court-martial to two years’ prision correccional militar and that he should commence to serve his sentence on January 5, 1898. <br/><br/>The petitioner claims that he comes within the provisions of the proclamation of amnesty and pardon issued by the President of the United States on the 4th day of July, 1902, and prays for his discharge under the same. <br/><br/>The judge of the Court of First Instance, after hearing the case, decided that the petitioner came within the amnesty proclamation, and directed that, upon taking the oath of allegiance required by the proclamation, he be discharged from custody. <br/><br/>An appeal has been taken by the Government front this decision. <br/><br/>It is contended by counsel for the petitioner that Act No 654, providing for appeals in <em>habeas corpus</em> proceedings, is in the nature of an ex post facto law, and that having, been enacted subsequent to petitioner’s right to petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>, this appeal should not be entertained. <br/><br/>In the decision of this court in the case of Frank Mekin v. George N. Wolfe, tendered on the 27th day of March, 1903, 1 this question was passed upon by this court, and it was there held that <em>habeas corpus</em> is a civil proceeding brought to enforce a civil right, and is entirely distinct front the criminal proceedings under which the prisoner has been tried and Convicted, and that the doctrine of ex post facto law can not be applied to the case. <br/><br/>‘The Amnesty Proclamation grants a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all Persons in the Philippine Archipelago who have participated in the insurrection against the authority and sovereignty of the Kingdom of Spain at divers times from August, 1986, until the cession of the Archipelago by that Kingdom to the United States, and those engaged in the insurrection against the authority and sovereignty of the United States, or who have given aid and comfort to persons participating in said insurrection,  \"for the offenses of treason or sedition, and for all offenses political in their character committed in the course of such insurrection pursuant to orders issued by the civil, military, or insurectionary authorities or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>There is no claim whatever that the defendant participated in either of these insurrections, nor that the character of the offense for which he was convicted was of the nature embraced in the proclamation. He was convicted of desertion, a violation of the laws pertaining to the military establishment of Spain. <br/><br/>The defendant clearly is not entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation. <br/><br/>It is not a case of this Government trying and convicting a person charged with desertion from the Spanish army. The defendant was convicted during the Spanish sovereignty of the offense of desertion, and is simply serving out his sentence for that offense. <br/><br/>Article XII of the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Spain provides that judgments rendered in criminal matters before the date of the treaty  \"shall be deemed to be final, and shall be executed in due form by competent authority in the territory within which such judgments should be carried out.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Under this clause of the treaty, it is incumbent upon this Government to execute the judgment in this case. <br/><br/>The judgment of the Court of first Instance directing the discharge of the prisoner from custody is reversed and the petitioner is remanded to the custody of the respondent, to be kept in his charge until the expiration of the term for which the petitioner has been sentenced. <br/><br/>The costs of proceedings is adjudged against the petitioner. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><p align=\"justify\"><em><strong><font color=\"#990000\">Endnotes:</font></strong></em></p><blockquote><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"/><br/>1.

Damian de la Cruz and Alvaro Mendoza were acquitted, and Francisco Rafael and Francisco Baltimosada were convicted and sentenced to the punishment of two years of presidio correccional with accessories. The two last-named defendants appeal from the judgment. <br/><br/>On the preliminary examination these defendants confessed to having committed various robberies in the barrio of Tambo and other adjacent barrios, including one on the road to Aliaga, which seems to be the robbery upon which the complaint is founded. They also confessed to being members of a band of robbers going about committing robberies and other depredations. <br/><br/>When the trial of the case came on in the Court of First Instance, they plead not guilty and each of them denied having any knowledge whatever of. the robberies to which they confessed. <br/><br/>They state, as a reason for having made the confessions in the preliminary investigation, that they were made through fear of ill treatment on the part of the police who had captured them. <br/><br/>Francisco Rafael stated that he had been ill treated by the lieutenant in whose charge he was, and that he was threatened by the lieutenant at the time he testified that he would again be ill treated in the same manner if he did not again confess before the justice of the peace. <br/><br/>Francisco Baltimosada also denied in his testimony in the Court of First Instance that he had anything to do with the robberies committed and to which he had confessed, and further stated that he had been terrorized into making the confessions before the justice of the peace by threats made by the lieutenant, who had extorted a confession from him through ill treatment, and that he believed that by making the confessions he would be released from further prosecution. <br/><br/>The lieutenant by whom the defendants claim to have been ill treated and forced to make these admissions denied having used any force what ever upon the defendants or any undue persuasions or threats, and states that the confessions were made voluntarily. <br/><br/>The justice of the peace before whom the preliminary examination was held also testified that there were no undue influences used upon the defendants at the preliminary hearing. <br/><br/>We are not entirely satisfied as to the admissibility of the confessions made by the defendants while under arrest. A confession in order to be admissible must be voluntary. An involuntary confession is so uncertain with regard to its truthfulness that it is unsafe as evidence to sustain a conviction. <br/><br/>There is no proof whatever offered by the Government of the corpus delicti except the confessions of the defendants. Outside of these confessions there is no proof of any robberies having been committed at the times and places at which the defendants are charged to have committed them. <br/><br/>It is the general rule that the corpus delicti must be proven by evidence independent of confessions. It is true that this evidence may he circumstantial, but there should be some evidence corroborating the confessions. <br/><br/>There is a vagueness both in the confessions and in the complaint. The names of the persons against whom the offense was committed are not stated in either, nor were they produced as witnesses at the trial. <br/><br/>The case was easily susceptible, so far as we can see, of proof, at least as to the corpus delicti; perhaps circumstances as to the identity of the defendants might have been shown connecting them with the commission of the offense, but it seems that the prosecution in the case relied exclusively upon the confessions and apparently made no effort to adduce other testimony. The case has not been made out to our satisfaction against the defendants, and we must reverse the judgment of the court below and acquit the defendants on account of the insufficiency of the evidence, which is accordingly done.

Manison, inspector of Constabulary, together with Pablo del Rosario, Pablo Reyes, and Cayetano Bacleon, Constabulary soldiers, together with a spy, went to a place called Caignin, near the town of Caloocan, to a house in which a man called Andres was living, for the purpose of arresting the latter This was at about 7 o’clock in the morning. They did not succeed in arresting Andrea because the latter, who, at the time of their approach, was eating, jumped up, and, seizing a revoker, ran away, jumping to the  ground from the porch of the house. They were unable to overtake him, although he u-as followed. They returned to the house and arrested all whom they found there and proceeded to conduct theta to this city. On the road, however, at a place called Matalahip, they were attacked at a street corner which they were passing by several Men, among whom they recognized Andrea, the accused, Nicasio Sevilla and Marcelo Magsalin, who fired at them several times, the result of the Shooting being the death of Cayetano Bacleon. <br/><br/>The facts constituted the crime of homicide, defined in article 401 together with an armed attack upon agents of the authorities in the exercise of the duties of their office, defined and Punished in articles 249 and 250 of the Penal Code, although the latter offense does not appear to be charged in the information filed by the provincial fiscal. The offense was committed by several men, who armed with carbines or guns, intercepted five members of the Constabulary who were returning to this city from the place where they had attempted to arrest one Andres who succeeded in Making his escape and attacked them by repeatedly firing upon the officers, the result of the attack being the death of Cayetano Bacleon by a gunshot wound received in the head. <br/><br/>The record discloses the fact that Andres, immediately after having succeeded in escaping from the police who were attempting to arrest him undertook to attack the latter, in company with the other aggressors, among the accused, Nicasio Sevilla, with the purpose of preventing his companions, who had been arrested in the house, from being taken to this city or to revenge himself for his own attempted arrest This was upon an express agreement, even if entered into upon the spur of the moment all of them having United for the exclusive purpose of attacking the police. To that end they Stationed themselves at the corner of the street, through which the police were passing and attacked them, each assisting and cooperating with the others, with the express intent to commit the said crimes of attack upon the authorities and homicide, the latter being the only one which is- now the subject of this prosecution. Therefore, there was no confused and tumultuous quarrel or array, nor was there a reciprocal aggression between both parties, inasmuch as the police simply defended themselves from the simultaneous and uniform attack upon them by the aggressors, each one of whom, therefore, became responsible for the homicide in question, as all of them, with malicious intent to do harm, took part in the aggression upon the said policemen, one of whom was killed. <br/><br/>Consequently this was not homicide in a confused and tumultuous affray, as the court below rewarded the crime charged. The violent killing of the policeman, Cayetano Bacleon, constitutes the offense of homicide, of which the accused, Nicasio Sevilla, is one of the persons responsible, as he, in company with Andrea and Marcelo Magsalin, took direct part in the attack which they together, and by means of firearms, made upon the said police. In the commission of the offense we must consider the aggravating circumstance of the use of prohibited arms, which private parties are not allowed to have in their possession. There are no mitigating circumstances, and therefore the proper penalty should be imposed in the maximum degree. <br/><br/>On these grounds we are therefore of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed and that Nicasio Sevilla, as guilty of the offense of homicide, should be convicted and sentenced to seventeen years four months and one day of reclusion temporal. together with the accessories designated in article 59 of the Code, to the payment of one thousand Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of the deceased, and to the payment of the costs in both instances. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough., <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">It appears from the statements in the information filed by the provincial fiscal of Pangasinan on the 22d of October, 1902, that the two accused and five other persons were in the office of the municipal treasurer of the town of Bautista; that lucri causa they committed the crime of theft, by taking several checks, American bank notes, and two warrants against the provincial treasurer of Pangasinan, of the total value of $3,477.16-3/5, Mexican, and which were in two envelopes in the pocket of the coat of Graciano Bautista, deputy provincial treasurer, which coat, as appeared subsequently in the course of the trial, its owner had taken off on account of the heat and had left it hanging on the edge of the writing table where Ramon Reynado, the municipal treasurer of said town, was working; that between 6 and 7 o’clock at night on the said date, after they had finished the work of collecting the taxes, deputy Graciano Bautista noticed that the envelopes containing the said valuable documents had disappeared from his pocket, and that he, in consequence, immediately reported the loss to the local authorities. <br/><br/>Although the charge was first brought against the two accused and Honorato Carungay, Hilario Cañeja, Norberto Alviar, Jose Santos, and Simeon de Guzman, because the latter were in the same office at the time in which the taking of these documents must have occurred, nevertheless, during the course of the trial, the court, in view of the resale of the proceedings, and acting in accordance with the opinion of the Prosecuting attorney, directed an acquittal of the last five accused, to the end that they might be called as witnesses against the first two, Balboa and Reynado. <br/><br/>The fact related, if proven, would constitute the crime of theft, defined and Punished by articles 517 and 518 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the valuable papers were taken lucri causa from the pocket of the coat of the deputy, Graciano Bautista, without violence or intimidation of the person, or the employment of force. Some of these papers were bank notes of the value of $157, all having been obtained from taxes collected in the said town of Bautista. <br/><br/>The two accused plead not guilty to the crime with which they were charged. The only evidence against them disclosed by the record of the case is the testimony of the deputy, Graciano Bautista. He testifies that on the afternoon of the 22d of August, 1902, he was in the office of the Municipal treasurer, engaged in collecting taxes; that the two accused, Balboa and Reynado, were there, as also Honorato Carungay, Norberto Alviar, Jose Santos, Hilario Cañeja, and Simeon de Guzman, who remained there all that afternoon; that the said Balboa and Reynado knew that the checks, warrants, and bank notes in two envelopes were in the pocket of his coat, which he had left hanging on the edge of the desk where Reynado was working; that shortly after Graciano Bautista saw Balboa and Reynado get up and take seats near the place where his coat was hanging; that a few moments before he noticed the disappearance of the said documents the two accused left the office, while the others remained there, and therefore the witness presumes that they were the persons who committed the offense. The record also disclosed the fact that, when Graciano Bautista gave the alarm upon the disappearance of the money, the accused, Balboa and Reynado, returned to the office; that when it was suggested that all present he searched, Graciano Bautista objected to this operation; that in the course of the afternoon Balboa picked up some papers which had fallen near or under the writing table where the coat was hanging, and that Balboa was nervous that afternoon. <br/><br/>Although the record disclosed the source of the cheeks, warrants, and bank notes concerning the theft of which this case deals, the record does not disclose sufficient evidence that these papers were actually placed in the pocket of the coat, there being no witness who saw them placed there, and, therefore, in view of the fact that no search was made of the persons present in the room, as suggested by Deputy Bautista, some doubt arises as to whether or not the crime charged in this information has been committed. <br/><br/>The evidence for the prosecution is not satisfactory or conclusive, or of such weight and character as to remove all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The mere fact that they were in the office on the afternoon of the occurrence is not sufficient proof of their guilt, any more than it was of that of the five men who were acquitted, but who were also present at the place at the time at which the theft was supposed to be committed. <br/><br/>Even in case the innocence of the accused should appear doubtful, it not being possible to determine from the evidence which of the two is the one guilty of the theft, the presumption of innocence exists in favor of each of them. Their guilt not having been satisfactorily proven, we are of the opinion that they are entitled to acquittal. (Sec. 57, G. O., 58.) <br/><br/>Therefore the judgment below must be reversed. The accused, Mariano Balboa and Ram on Reynado, are acquitted, with the costs of both instances de oficio.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">One morning in March, 1898, the four accused, provided with bolos and firearms, went to a granary belonging to Ponciano Alba, situated at the place called Tansa Norte, within the limits of the town of Capiz, Panay, and, under threats of death, compelled Basilio Difon, the person left in charge by the owner, to leave the house and to deliver the palay which was stored there under lock and key. This Difon did and made delivery of the palay by measure, this operation tasting two days. It appeared that there were 447 cavanes of palay, which were taken out and carried away on sleds, in the presence of witnesses, to the house of Fernando. They also carried away agricultural instruments, a caldron, 2 barotos, 43 boards, 5 beams, a milk cow, and 10 carabaos which were in the field. Difon was compelled to accompany the accused to help catch these animals. Three full days were occupied in the transportation of these goods, which the accused claimed belonged to them, and which were taken by them to their houses. Two of the carabaos were recovered by the complaining witness, having been found in the possession of Fernando Vega, who objected to returning them, claiming that they were his, and therefore a policeman named Barcenas, who accompanied Alba, was obliged to issue a receipt for the carabaos taken by him, and which were turned over to the authorities. The animals and the other property taken are worth $1,384.85. Some days afterwards, as appears in the cause, the accused also took possession of certain parcels of land belonging to the complaining witness Alba. <br/><br/>The witnesses, Gualberto de la Cruz, Dionisio Bueno, Valentin Duro, Pablo Arroyo, Inocente Andrada, Toribio Lopez, and Tom as Aquijano, by their testimony corroborated the allegations of fact contained in the information, and those stated in detail by the complainant Alba and his agent, Basilio Difon. <br/><br/>The accused, Fernando Vega, his son Benito Vega, and the brothers Gregorio Lara and Eduardo Lara, relatives, who were working for the Vega’s, pleaded not guilty. Fernando testified that he lived in the barrio of Tansa, in which the complaining witness, Ponciano Alba, had no property whatever; that the two carabaos taken from him were his property, and that on this account the police agent who took them from him by order of the justice of the peace, gave him a receipt; but that they were not the same carabaos which were subsequently shown him, as the latter were old, unbranded animals, whereas his animals were young; that he so stated to the justice of the peace, but the latter paid no attention to him, the witness adding that he had been on bad terms with Ponciano Alba since 1891. Benito Vega testified that he lived with his father, and the brothers Gregorio and Eduardo Lara testified that in March, 1898-99, Ponciano Alba had no granary or any other property in the barrio of Tansa Norte, and that at that time nothing of particular note had occurred at that place. This was corroborated by the testimony of the witnesses .Juan Balasa, Hilario Bigares, Valerio Anerismatmat, Vito Lara, Estanislao Sello, Victorio Ballena, Filomena Asulpado, and Ruperto Acejo. <br/><br/>According to documents in the record introduced by the provincial fiscal, Doña Lucinda Barrios, widow of the late Don Bernabe Lara, appeared before the clerk of the court and testified that her deceased brother-in-law, Ram on Lara, charged her, before his death, that the three pieces of land situated in Tans a, shown in the plat on pages 168 and 169, and which he had inherited from his deceased father, Don Francisco Lazaro, were to be delivered to Ramon’s daughter, Doña Flora Lara, and that therefore, in compliance with this verbal charge, she delivered the said lands to the said Flora Lara and to her husband, Don Ponciano Alba, who received them with gratitude. The record also discloses a copy of the inscription of certain lands in the registry of property. (Folio 171.) <br/><br/>The defense of the accused also exhibited the will of Don Francisco Lazaro, from the contents of which it appears that the said Bernabe, Ramon, and Flora Lara were his children, and that Severina Lara, the wife of Fernando Vega, was a daughter of the testator by a second marriage, as stated by counsel for the defense, who also exhibited a document in which Ramon Lara appears to have stated that he had pledged to his sister, for 50 pesos, a piece of land, planted in nip a palms, situated in the barrio of Tansa. <br/><br/>The facts stated, and which appear to be proven in this case, and which are classified in the complaint as constituting the crime of robbery in a gang, constitute the crime of coercion, defined and punished by article 497 of the Penal Code, Inasmuch as Fernando Vega, with his son Benito and two employees of theirs, exercised violence or force and intimidation on the person of Difon, obliging him to open the rice deposit belonging to Ponciano Alba, absent from the place, and which was under lock and key, and compelling him to deliver to them the rice and then to go away and leave the granary, of which he had been placed in charge by the complaining witness; and also to accompany theta to get in from the pasture the cow and carabaos mentioned, exercising such coercion that he dared make no opposition whatever to the acts of spoliation of the said property committed by the four accused, or to their transportation, during a period of three days, to the house of Fernando Vega, by whom these acts, constituting the offense of coercion were committed, without any right to do so. notwithstanding the fact that Fernando Vega, who was the principal of tender in this case, alleges that he was the owner of the property of which he took possession by means of this coercion of the person left in charge of it, it is not permissible to take the law into one’s own hands, and to seize the property of a third person without being authorized to do so, and entirely disregarding the authorities whose duty it is to settle disagreements between private individuals and to give each one that which is his due, in accordance with the law. <br/><br/>Fernando Vega, believing that he was entitled to the property of which Ponciano Alba, by means of his agent, was in possession, in the barrio of Tansa Norte of the town of Panay, seized it with the assistance of one of his sons and two employees, with intent to take the law into his own hands, but without animus furandi. Though in effecting this seizure he availed himself of the intimidation of the person so left in charge, the record does not disclose the existence of that specific wrongful intent which characterizes robbery. <br/><br/>It must be understood, however, that this decision is without prejudice to the rights of the complaining witness, Ponciano Alba, the presumptive owner of the property taken, to recover the same by the proper civil action. <br/><br/>In view, then, of the fact that in the complaint the offense charged is that of robbery in a gang, and that the facts proven do not constitute this offense, but constitute the offense of coercion, it follows that, as the latter offense has not been prosecuted, no conviction of the accused can be had, and therefore the judgment below must be reversed and set aside, and, should a new information be filed on the charge of coercion, a new trial should he had, in accordance with the law. <br/><br/>The judgment, therefore, is set aside, and the judge, upon filing a new complaint, Charging the said offense of coercion, will proceed to hold a new trial, in accordance with the law, without prejudice to the right of Ponciano Alba to bring the corresponding civil action to which he may be entitled.

After binding them they carried them toward the west to a place some 40 brazas from the house. On the same night and at the same house Pedro Perez and Apolinario Reyes went to the house of Alberto de Guzman, situated a short distance from the house of Rosa Magalang, his mother, and also captured Alberto, who was taken to the same place to which Gonzales and Vera had been conducted, near a stream not far distant, and there all three met a violent death by decapitation. The police, who searched for them on the following day, upon complaint of Severina de Guzman, sister of Alberto, and who lived in the house of his mother, Rosa Magalang, found the bodies of these three men with their heads separated from their trunks and with their arms tied, but without finding any other wounds on the bodies. <br/><br/>From the facts related, it follows that the triple crime of murder has been committed, defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the deceased, after having been captured, between 10 and 11 o’clock on the night of the 27th of October, 1901, were bound and taken to a place not far distant from their houses where they were treacherously killed, the aggressors, in the execution of the crime, having availed themselves of the defenseless condition of their victims. It therefore appears that the murderers assured the consummation of the crime without risk to themselves arising from any attempt at self-defense, which they knew their victims were unable to make. <br/><br/>The three accused pleaded not guilty to the crimes of which they were charged, but nevertheless the record discloses sufficient evidence for the prosecution. The facts established by the evidence, and sufficient in number, unquestionably show the guilt of the three accused as coprincipals in the murders for which they were prosecuted. <br/><br/>Robbery was not the motive of this triple crime. It was revenge, hatred, and malice, arising from the passion of jealousy on the part of a third person, who took no part in the murders, as was clearly explained by the girl, the sister of the unfortunate Alberto, and who lived in the house of the mother of the latter, Rosa Magalang. This girl was an eyewitness to the seizure of Gonzales and Vera. <br/><br/>Severina de Guzman had been abducted by Benigno de Vera for immoral purposes, and for this abduction Benigno de Vera was prosecuted and convicted. A few days after the girl Severina had been carried off by her abductor, and while still detained in his house, Maria no Gonzales, accompanied by others who had been searching for her, found her in Benigno’s house, from which they took her, restoring her to her mother. After this occurrence Gonzales desired to marry her, while Benigno still continued his solicitations that she return to him. As Benigno was a friend of the accused, Pedro Perez and Graciano Buena Ventura, Severina believed that the latter had acted by reason of their hatred toward Gonzales. The fact is that not only was the latter murdered, but also Vera and Alberto, brother of the abducted girl. <br/><br/>It is a familiar doctrine, constantly observed and applied in practice, that the courts, after a careful study of a case, are required to conscientiously weigh the evidence of all kinds produced in the course of the trial, the statements of the accused, and the arguments for the prosecution and the defense, in order that they may thereby render a prop judgment. <br/><br/>Circumstantial evidence arising from well-established facts, ,and which fully convinces the mind, may be the basis of a judgment of conviction and is as important as any other kind of proof producing moral evidence, inasmuch as the ample power which the court has under the law to consider evidence of both kinds, is only subject to the rules of a rational discretion; and it is common sense to believe that when the truth has once been ascertained, whatever may have been the means of proof by which such truth may have been arrived at, the upright judgment and severe conscience of the judges will not be in convict with sound discretion. <br/><br/>The fact of the murders is unquestionable. That has been plainly demonstrated by the finding of the three decapitated bodies, which cry for justice and demand the punishment of the murderers. It is unquestionable that the murderers were the three accused, Pedro Perez, Graciano Buenaventura, and Apolinario Reyes, and that they, acting in concert, proceeded to carry off the three victims and assassinate them by decapitation, as the heads of the deceased were found separated from their bodies. <br/><br/>There was no witness to these murders, but the testimony of the three witnesses who saw and were present at the capture of the three deceased; the fact that on the day following the three bodies, somewhat separated, but only a short distance from one another, were found as described; the uniform manner of their killing, as all three were decapitated, no other wounds being found on the bodies; the participation of Pedro Perez in the capture of the three deceased; the fact that these captures took place almost at the same hour on the night of the 27th of October, 1901. although it does not appear whether Gonzales and Vera were captured before Alberto de Guzman, or vice versa; the circumstance that no other crime was committed in the two houses from which the deceased were taken; the fact that the accused have not produced any evidence to destroy or contradict the charges brought against them in the trial, inasmuch as, if they were not the murderers they should explain — it having been shown that they were the ones who carried off the deceased — who it was that so cruelly and inhumanly decapitated the three men who were carried off on that night. All these data in support of the prosecution, founded upon established facts which constitute circumstantial evidence and give rise to the strongest presumptions when considered together with the other data contained in the case, especially, the testimony of the three witnesses mentioned, demonstrate conclusively, and without leaving room for the slightest doubt, that the three accused were coprincipals by direct participation, and, as a result of a previously concerted agreement, in the commission of the three offenses of murder charged. <br/><br/>In the perpetration of the three murders we must consider the presence of the aggravating circumstances of premeditation and nocturnity, there being present no mitigating circumstances. The record discloses the fact that the three murderers, acting upon agreement and well armed, proceeded to capture the three victims, availing themselves of the silence of the night, acting upon a preconceived plan and purpose of revenge, it being unquestionable that they acted jointly and as a result of a previous agreement, after having meditated with reflection upon the consummation of the crime. This is shown by the presence of Perez at the time of the commission of both seizures. The proximity of the houses in which the victims were living, the fact that these captures were effected one after the other with a very short interval of time between them, the fact that the three bodies were found, as stated, with no other wounds than those on the neck and all with the head separated from the body and in the same place, although slightly separated from one another — all these details demonstrate premeditation and a cold-blooded and methodical commission of the crimes, without precipitation or confusion. <br/><br/>With respect to the objection raised by counsel for the accused, made before this court, it is sufficient to say that the complaint expresses in the singular number the denomination of the crime of which the accused are charged, and that the deceased were conducted, bound, to the place where they were subsequently murdered. <br/><br/>From the content of the complaint it is inferred that the same refers to one single crime of murder, and as the decision of the judge and the decision of the court are limited to convicting the accused of only one crime of murder, although the evidence demonstrates that they were guilty of three murders, it does not appear that there has been any infraction of the procedure of law, nor, because the record discloses the commission of three murders, can the complaint, the trial, and the judgment below be considered as defective or void, more especially in view of the fact that no exception was taken at the proper time during the trial in the court below. <br/><br/>Upon these grounds, therefore, we consider that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed with respect to the personal penalty imposed, which will be executed in accordance with article 101 of the Penal Code, in the public square of the town of San Carlos, Pangasinan, the three accused being further condemned, in case of a pardon, to the accessories of absolute, perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during their lifetime, unless such penalties shall have been expressly remitted in this pardon covering the principal penalty, and, further, to pay, pro rata or in solidum, the sum of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs and widow, if any, of each one of the three deceased, and the payment, each one, of a third part of the costs of both instances.

His duty was to collect the accounts connected with the launch D. Vicente. He was discharged the last of July or the first of August, 1902, and a criminal complaint was filed against him for estafa. It charged that he had collected ninety-four different accounts, amounting to 1,043 pesos, front the debtors of Don Geronimo Jose and had not paid over the money. These accounts ran from July 16, 1901, to July 2’2, 1902. <br/><br/>1. That these accounts were delivered to the defendant to collect and that he had not paid the amount thereof to his employer, may be considered as proved. But, with the exception of one item of 40 pesos, there is no evidence that the debtors of Don Geronimo Jose had ever paid these bills. <br/><br/>The testimony of Don Geronimo Jose and of Don Francisco Gonzales, to the effect that they had made investigations and found that the defendant was a defaulter, is not sufficient to establish the essential fact that the defendant had actually received this money from the said debtors. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the Solicitor-General that the failure of the defendant to return the accounts or the money, or to explain this failure, is sufficient to convict him. As the defendant is not required to testify against himself, his failure to explain why he had not retained either the accounts or the money, and his silence on this point when charged with the crime, are not sufficient evidence to show that the debtors had actually paid the money to him. This should have been proved by the debtors themselves. There is no presumption that, when an account has been delivered for collection, it is paid to the person sent to collect it. <br/><br/>After it had been claimed by Don Geronimo Jose that the defendant was a defaulter to the amount of 1,043 pesos, his mother attempted to settle the matter. All instrument was drawn up by a clerk of Don Geronimo to be signed by the defendant. It acknowledged that he had embezzled the above sum. It was read in the presence of the defendant and his mother. The defendant said nothing during the interview. The document was never signed, the mother and Don Geronimo not being able to agree upon its terms. <br/><br/>It is said that the silence of the defendant on this occasion was a confession of his guilt. We call not so hold. By General Orders, No. 58, section 15, paragraph 3, the refusal or neglect of a defendant to testify can not in any manner prejudice him. A person chased with a crime is not called upon to make any explanation or denial, except to plead guilty or not guilty. He can remain silent as well before the trial as during it, and his silence can not be considered as a confession of guilt. Any other rule would lead to the result that, every time anything was said in the presence of a prisoner indicating his guilt, he would be called upon to deny it, whether it was said by the prosecuting attorney, newspaper reporters, police officers, or others. <br/><br/>2. As to the 40 pesos mentioned above, there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant. <br/><br/>This was a claim against Timoteo Sevilla. The receipted bill delivered to the defendant was found in the possession of this debtor and was produced at the trial. The defendant admitted to Francisco Gonzales, and, as we understand the evidence, to Don Geronimo Jose, that he had collected this amount. <br/><br/>3. To the first complaint presented the defendant demurred. The fiscal having admitted that the demurrer was well taken, the court on October 18 directed the complaint to be amended. The defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that the demurrer had put an end to the proceeding. This motion was denied. The claim of the defendant is that he demurred to the complaint on the fourth ground mentioned in section 21 of General Orders, No. 58, namely, that the facts stated did not constitute a public offense and that this is a detect which can not be avoided by an amendment, as provided in section 23. <br/><br/>This claim can not be sustained. A complaint as drawn may fail to charge an offense by reason of the omission of some material fact which exists, but which the fiscal by oversight has neglected to insert in the complaint. With this fact inserted the complaint could charge an offense. Such a mistake is one that can be avoided been amendment and the court is by said section 23 authorized to so direct. <br/><br/>The judgment is modified by changing, the penalty from six months to two months and one day, and the indemnity from 1,043 pesos to 40 pesos. In all Other respects it is affirmed with costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

It is not claimed that the article of the Code under which the conviction was had is invalid or unconstitutional, but only that the evidence fails to show the commission of the offense punished by that article. <br/><br/>The appellate jurisdiction conferred upon this court by Act No. 136 of the Commission is identical, as respects criminal cases, with that possessed under General Orders, No. 58, by the preexisting Supreme Court. general Orders, No. 58, section 43, provides generally that  \"from all final judgments of the Courts of first Instance, or courts of similar jurisdiction, and in all cases in which the law now provides for appeals from said courts, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court as hereinafter prescribed.\" It then goes on to except from this general provision judgments rendered in appeals taken  \"from the final judgments of justices of the peace in criminal cases to the courts of the next superior grade\" and it then excepts from this exception  \"cases involving the validity or constitutionality of a statute, wherein appeal may be made to the Supreme Court.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The courts of justices of the peace in the city of Manila, which by section 69 of Act No. 136 had been continued as theretofore organized, were abolished by Act No. 183 (sec. 44), and by the same Act (sec. 40) provision was made for the organization of municipal courts for the city of Manila, and they were given jurisdiction over offenses where  \"the maximum punishment is by imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not more than one hundred dollars, or both,\" which was the same as that previously possessed by the courts of justices of the peace. (G.O., 58, s. 108; Act No. 136, sec. 56, par. 6.) <br/><br/>There is some force in the argument that, as the courts of justices of the peace of Manila have been abolished, and as the municipal courts were not expressly substituted in their place, and as the subject of appeals from municipal courts was expressly regulated in the Act creating those courts Act No. 183, sec. 42), all that part of General Orders, No. 58, section 43, which relates to appeals from justices of the peace to Courts of First Instance must be regarded as having been repealed so far as respects the city of Manila, leaving the general provision of that section giving the right of appeal  \"from all final judgments of the Courts of First Instance,\" in force, and without limitations or exceptions. <br/><br/>We are, however, on the whole, of opinion, having regard to the fact that the jurisdiction conferred upon the municipal courts of Manila was the same as that of the justice courts in criminal cases, that the intention of the Commission was to preserve the limitation upon the right of appeal in cases originating in the municipal courts which had previously existed as respects the same class of cases originating in the justice courts. This limitation would continue to exist with reference to justices’ courts outside of Manila, and it is not probable that it was the legislative intention to establish a difference in this respect between cases appealed from the inferior criminal tribunals of that city and those appealed from tribunals of the same grade in other parts of the Archipelago. <br/><br/>The appeal is dismissed, with costs. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

That the defendant paid Doña Inocencia Soco, as a coowner With the plaintiff of the land in controversy, 10 pesos.

They proceeded with force and arms to rob the houses of several persons, and while engaged in the commission of these crimes four boys, the oldest 16 years, who were returning from fishing, passed the gang, and, recognizing one of them, one of the boys asked that they were doing. The answer was a blow which felled the boy to the ground almost senseless. Subsequently, seeing that they were recognized the ladrones caught three of the boys and bound their arms; they also seized and bound one Pedro Valerio, and then marched their four prisoners to the beach, and, placing them in a banca, all embarked save two of the ladrones, one of whom was the petitioner, Marcelino de la Cruz (also called Maximo de la Cruz), and the banca was pulled out into the bay. when at a point seemingly half way between Manila and Cavite, the ladrones threw their prisoners overboard and the three boys were drowned, Pedro Vale Rio saving himself by swimming, having succeeded in working his arms out of the rattan that bound them. <br/><br/>On the 27th of February, the commanding officer of the district reported that he had arrested Maximo de la Cruz (the petitioner herein), one of the supposed authors of the crime, whereupon it was ordered by the adjutant-general of the department of the Pacific and Eighth Army Corps that the matter he referred to the Court of First Instance of Cavite, with delivery of the prisoner, in order that he might be criminal prosecuted, the military authorities in the meantime to guard the prisoner. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance of Cavite took cognizance of the case March 13, 1900, and on the 16th of March, after declaring the accused, in conformity with the old procedure, charged with the crime of robbery and triple murder, ordered, on the same date, that he be remanded and notified of the charges against him. <br/><br/>The cause being continued, on the 18th of May, 1900, judgment was rendered adjudging the accused, Marcelino de la Cruz, guilty of gang robbery and triple murder, and he was sentenced to imprisonment for life, and notified of such sentence on June 2, 1900. As there was no suitable and safe place of imprisonment in Cavite, authority was given by Major-General Bates, commander of the department, to send the prisoner to Bilibid Prison for the imprisonment for which he was sentenced by the court, and the prisoner, Marcelino de la Cruz, was confined in said prison July 24, 1900, pursuant to said judgment of conviction and said order, and has ever since remained in said prison. <br/><br/>The case was taken to the Supreme Court en consulta, and on the hearing the fiscal asked that the sentence of the court below be declared void for reason of the insufficiency of proof, and requested that the case be sent back to the Court of First Instance. The criminal department of the Supreme Court, on the 27th of June, 1900, entered a decree declaring the sentence of the lower court of no effect and directing that a certified copy of the order, together with the opinion of the ministerio fiscal, be returned to the lower court in order time the judge should comply With the views of the fiscal, and proceed in conformity, as Much as possible, with the new law of procedure, section 110, General Orders, No. 58. <br/><br/>In compliance with the directions of the Supreme Court, the case was again taken up by the lower court, and two complaints were made against the prisoner, one for the Crime of robbery and the other for the crime of triple murder, in accordance with the requirements of section 110, General Orders, No. 58, but without the accused being informed of said complaints. <br/><br/>In March, 1901, the Court of First Instance of Cavite decided that it had no jurisdiction to heal and determine the charges made in the said complaints, holding that the came within the jurisdiction of the military authorities, and ordered that the entire proceedings be sent to the commanding general of the district, after previously notifying the secretary of the criminal department of the Supreme Court of such action. <br/><br/>The commander of the Department of Luzon having, received the complaints, etc., forwarded the same to the secretary to the military governor of the Islands, in order that he should give his Opinion as to the most expeditions manner of proceeding therein. The secretary in turn, by indorsement of May 8, 1901, forwarded the causes to the President of the Supreme the Court for such action as should he deemed best, calling his attention to the fact that although there was no doubt of the incompetency of the Court of First Instance in the charges of robbery, with respect to the charge of murder pending against the prisoner, it should be prosecuted in said court as there was no law prohibiting it from exercising jurisdiction in such case. <br/><br/>The original papers are in the records of the Supreme Court, but doubtless due to the reorganization of the court, no action was taken on the question submitted by the secretary to the military governor, and the petitioner remains in Bilibid Prison, freed front the judgment of imprisonment for life, but still under the two charges of robbery and murder, and is properly held in custody to answer to said charges, the prosecution or disposal of which should be made without further delay. <br/><br/>In view of these facts the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the petitioner Marcelino de la Cruz, remanded to the custody of the warden of Bilibid.

They had with them Toribio Macapinlac, Whom they had arrested in Concepcion on the charge of stealing a carabao belonging to Vicente Mangune. In crossing the estero at Talabangca the policeman Jose Tengco struck Macapinlac, who was at that time tied elbow to elbow, two blows with the butt of laws gun for having refused to confess that he was guilty of the theft. The blows were received on the abdomen and on the back, and as a result thereof, in less than half an hour, Toribio Macapinlac fell to the ground, and shortly after died in consequence of internal hemorrhages and the rapture of the spleen, as appeared in the examination held by a physician who was a member of the board of health of Arayat. <br/><br/>The facts stated constitute the crime of murder, defined and punished in article 403 of the Penal Code. The deceased was struck with the butt of a gun, and, in Kansans of the blow so reassured, he died in less than half an lair, owing to injuries received by the spleen or some ethyl vital organ. At the time the blow was struck the deceased was unable to defend himself or ward off the attack, and, although he was not tied for the purpose of killing Honeywell but because tie was being conveyed as a prisoner charged with theft, it is unquestionable that his aggressor acted with safety to himself, employing means Which were conducive to the accomplishment of his purpose without any risk arising from an attempt at self-defense. Therefore the attack must be regarded as a treacherous one (alevosia), which circumstance converts the violent death of the deceased into murder and demands a heavier penalty. <br/><br/>The defendant, Jose Tengco, pleaded not guilty and testified as a witness in his own behalf. He stated that he had struck the deceased, Toribio Macapinlac, two blows whitewall the butt of the gun he was carrying because Macapinlac had lied, although he alleged that he had struck the deceased by order of Corpl. Antonio Mariano. <br/><br/>This allegation, denied by the corporal, and which was apparently made by the defense in the belief that it exempted the defendant from responsibility, has not been proven in the trial. Even if it had been, in order that the person who actually peripherals the act may be exempt from criminal liability it is indispensable that the order be lawful, and the act done or ordered to be cloned must also be lawful. Under these conditions obedience is due. Without these conditions — that, is, when the order is unlawful or the act ordered to be done is unlawful — no obedience is due, for over and above the superior who orders the execution of such an unlawful act is the law itself, which prohibits the commission of any act contrary to its precepts. Therefore before the penal law the accused can not be regarded as exempt from liability. <br/><br/>Apart from his explicit confession, the record contains sufficient oral evidence to fully convince the mind of the guilt of the defendant, who attacked the deceased in the presence of witnesses whose testimony supports the charge. <br/><br/>In the commission of the crime we must consider and apply mitigating circumstance No. 3 of article 9, and also the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the accused, owing to his nativity and ignorance, erroneously believed that he had a right to punish the deceased for lying. In so doing it is questionable that he had no intention of killing him, but simply of punishing him by beating him with a gun — an unlawful act. The aggravating circumstance No. 11 of article 10 of the Penal Code can not be applied, as it was not necessary for the accused, Tengco, to have availed himself of his capacity as a member of the municipal police in order to illtreat the deceased, Toribio Macapinlac. <br/><br/>Upon these considerations and finding the existence in a marked degree of the two mitigating circumstances referred to, without the concurrence of any aggravating circumstance, we must apply the provisions of article 81, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code, imposing upon the defendant the penalty immediately inferior to that corresponding to the crime of murder, as designated in article 403 in its medium grade, to wit, the penalty. of presidio mayor in its maximum degree to cadena temporal in its minimum and medium degrees. <br/><br/>With respect to the motion for a new trial, made and overruled in the court below and again brought forward in the appellate court, we regard it as unsustainable, as it does not fall within section 42 of general orders, No. 58, it not having been alleged that it was impossible to introduce the evidence now ordered on account of cello sufficient reason, or that a favorable result of the evidence would be of notorious influence upon the defense of the accused. Furthermore the motion is not supported by the affidavits of the witnesses by whose testimony it is proposed to introduce new evidence of the defendant s innocence. <br/><br/>We consider therefore, that the decision of the court below overruling the said motion for a new trial was correct, upon the grounds therein stated. As we have already said, even if it were proven that the accused illtreated the deceased by order of a third person, it cannot be considered that he acted in accordance with the obedience due to a superior, because the act was unlawful; nor could the duty or in the lawful exercise of a right, inasmuch as he had no right to beat Toribio Macapinlac with the butt of his gun without reason, and upon a futile pretext, to such an extent as to deprive him of life. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed must be reversed and the accused, Jose Tengco, condemned to the penalty of fourteen years of cadena temporal, the medium period of the penalty immediately inferior to that prescribed lay article 103, together with the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of the penalty and absolute, perpetual disqualification, and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities through his life, and to the payment of 1,000 Mexican pesos to the heirs of the deceased, Toribio Macapinlac, and to the payment of the costs of both instances.

From this sentence they have appealed. <br/><br/>On the 23d day of December, 1902, after the cause had been transferred to this court, the defendants presented a motion for a new trial, alleging that they were entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation issued by the President of the United States on the 4th day of July, 1902, and in support of their application presented certain affidavits made by each of them. <br/><br/>The affidavit of Manuel Repollo states that on the date of the killing of the deceased he belonged to the Katipunan government and was a member of the town council of the barrio of San Juan; that the defendants Candido Repollo (his brother), Florencio Nicolas, and Bruno Dolor also belonged to the Katipunan government; that affiant has been sentenced to death for participating in the murder of Basilio Limon; that the death of the said Basilio Limon occurred in the following manner:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>On a night in the month of November, 1899, on the arrival of the American soldiers at his town, one Francisco Cabe and Insiong Prado, who belonged to the insurrecto army, came to his house and said to him:  \"Do you know there is a spy in the barrio?\" He answered,  \"No.\" They said that the spy lived near affinities house, and that affiant should call his companions to seize him; that it was an order of his superior and for that reason he went to call the assistance of the defendants Candido Repollo, Bruno Dolor, and Florencio Nicolas; that Francisco Cabe and Insiong Prado remained at the house of affiant while they went to the house of the deceased Basilio Limon; that when they reached the house they caused the deceased to come downstairs and then manacled him and carried him off to where the said Francisco Cabe and Insiong Prado were awaiting them; that Francisco Cabe and Insiong Prado said,  \"Let us go behind your house;\" that they went there, leading the deceased; that Francisco Cabe and Insiong Prado then commanded them to retire to their houses and notified them to be careful not to relate to anybody what had taken place; that Cabe and Prado then killed Basilio Limon; that there were four soldiers armed with guns and fifteen men armed with bolos who accompanied affiant to the house of Basilio Limon, the deceased, when he went to seize him; that the reason for the killing of Basilio Limon, as stated by Insiong Prado and Francisco Cabe, was because he was a spy of the Americans and was going to inform the Americans of the place where the insurrectos were stationed; that Insiong Prado was afterwards captured and hung by the Americans; that Francisco Cabe is also dead, he having died by the garrote vil. <br/><br/>The affidavits of the defendants Candido Repollo, Florencio Nicolas, and Bruno Dolor are substantially to the same effect, each of them stating that he was a member of the Katipunan society, and admitting their connection with the murder of the deceased and relating the circumstances of the killing of the deceased for the cause and in the manner mentioned by Manuel Repollo. <br/><br/>It was shown at the trial below that the defendants went to the house of the deceased, commanded him to come downstairs, and manacled and carried him off. The decapitated body of the deceased was found a short distance from his house, his head being about 300 feet from where his body lay. The defendants were neighbors of the deceased; had known him for a number of years, and no in feeling was known to exist between them, nor does any motive appear for the killing of the deceased unless it can be inferred frail the fact that after the killing the deceased s wife went to the house of the defendant Manuel Repollo and there lived with him until the complaint was filed against them. Two of the defendants, Candido Repollo and Florencio Nicolas, were godfathers of the children of the deceased. <br/><br/>An investigation of the record in the case indicates a strong probability that the motive for the killing was of a political character, and resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos during the insurrection. If so, the offense comes within the provisions of the amnesty proclamation. <br/><br/>By the provisions of section 42 of General Orders, No. 58, the defendant may move, either in the court in which the trial was had or in this court, after the appeal here, for a reopening of the case upon the ground of newly discovered evidence material to his defense. <br/><br/>While this motion is not based strictly on newly discovered evidence, yet it is based upon the existence of testimony which was not material at the time of the trial in the court below, but which has become of vital importance to the defendants by reason of the amnesty proclamation of the President. <br/><br/>The proof, such as is contained in the affidavits, if made on the trial believe., would have been no defense in the case. But if the trial had occurred subsequent to the issuance of the proclamation, the same proof, if believed, would have entitled the defendants to an acquittal. <br/><br/>Unless a new trial is granted, no opportunity will be given defendants to avail themselves of this defense, and the judgment must consequently be affirmed, notwithstanding they may have a valid defense if an opportunity is afforded them to make it. <br/><br/>We think that the application comes within the spirit of the provisions of section 42 of General Orders, No. 58, and that justice requires that a new trial should be granted. <br/><br/>The judgment will be set aside, and the cause remanded to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <br/><br/>Costs of this instance is adjudged de oficio. <br/><br/>It is so ordered and directed. <br/><br/>Torres, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, with whom concurs ARELLANO, <em>C.J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I dissent.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On June 7, 1902, Domingo Uson and Victor Pano were arrested at the place called Dalagud, of the town of Zaragoza, Nueva Ecija, by Jacinto Martinez, an officer or secret agent of the Constabulary forces stationed in that province. He was accompanied by the policemen Sebastian Garcia and Daniel Layug, and by Victoriano Nucum, a private citizen. Uson and Pano were suspected of being guilty of the theft of certain carabaos, the majority of which were the property of Mariano Baun. The two suspects, with the carabaos found in their possession, were taken to a place called Atiuc, in the barrio of San Miguel, in the town of Murcia, where they were tied elbow to elbow and cruelly illtreated by the defendant Martinez, who beat them whitewall the butt of his revolver and submerged them in an estero near that place. Afterwards, while they were completely drenched, he took them to the police station of the barrio, where he again beat them to such an extent that Victoriano Pano died on the morning of June 9 in the station, and Domingo Uson three days later in the municipal presidency of Tarlac. <br/><br/>An examination of the body of Pano made in the justice’s court of Murcia, by Prudencio Rodriguez, a medical student, on June 9, disclosed signs of blows on the breast, the left side, the back, and the neck. one rib was broken and the back of the neck was beaten into a jelly, showing that the deceased had met his death in consequence of the injuries caused by the blows inflicted upon him. The body of Domingo Uson was examined by Dr. Jose Espinosa, who has certified that it showed a contusion on the right wall of the thorax, another in the right lumbar region and several in the abdominal region. From the autopsy held it appeared that the right lung and the pleura were adhering to the anterior wall of the thorax; that the fourth right rib was broken, and that the left lobes of the liver and of the spleen were congested, and that therefore it was his opinion that the detail of the deceased was caused by the blows inflicted upon him. <br/><br/>Prosecutions have not been instituted for each one of the two murders committed. At the instance of the counsel for the defendants the provincial fiscal, who had filed a separate information for each offense, consolidated the two cases, and filed an amended information. (Folio 32.) The judge thereupon directed the consolidation of the two cases, and the prosecution of the two charges of murder in one action. (Folio 34.) <br/><br/>The facts related constitute two crimes of murder, committed on the persons of Victoriano Pano and Domingo Uson, defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code. These two men met a violent death from blows inflicted upon them by Jacinto Martinez, While they were tied elbow to elbow, and in such a condition that it was impossible for them to defend themselves or to impede the blows by which they received injuries which resulted in their death. It follows, therefore, that the accused availed himself of means for the execution of his purpose which directly assured its accomplishment without risk to himself arising from an attempt at self-defense on the part of the victims, and consequently it is unquestionable that the circumstance of treachery (alevosia) concurs. <br/><br/>The defendant Jacinto Martinez plead not guilty. Notwithstanding his denial and exculpative allegations, the record nevertheless discloses evidence sufficient to convince the mind that he was the sole author of the blows and ill treatment inflicted upon the two deceased. This was affirmed by four witness to the ill treatment, who also stated that Martinez fired his revolver at Domingo Uson, and that the bullet passed so closed to his face that it left a black mark; that after the deceased were submerged, with their hands tied, in the Atiuc estero, the defendant took them to the police station of the barrio, where Victoriano Pano was again beaten with the butt of a revolver, and that he fell to the ground, never again to rise. They added that the two deceased were at that time completely drenched and complained of pains in the chest. The testimony of these four witnesses, Domingo Tejero, Pedro Mendoza, Potenciano Mendoza, and Agaton Baun, is further corroborated by the testimony of two other witnesses, Guido Mendoza and Eleno Mallari. <br/><br/>The witnesses presented by counsel for the defendant, Gavina de los Santos, his wife, Proceso Aguilar, and Juan Canlas, testified that Jacinto Martinez, after having turned the prisoners over at the police station of San Miguel on the afternoon of June 8, returned to his home and there remained, according to his wife’s statement. <br/><br/>Aguilar and Canlas testified that the equalized did not illtreat the deceased. This was also affirmed by the other three accused, Sebastian Garcia, Daniel Layug, and Victoriano Nucum, acquitted below, who further stated that the deceased were not illtreated on the road, and that they did not complain of any pains. <br/><br/>This testimony is evidently insufficient to overcome the evidence of the prosecution, and is wholly insufficient to show the innocence of Jacinto Martinez. It was demonstrated in the course of the trial that he alone inflicted the blows received by the deceased. <br/><br/>In the commission of the double crime of murder — and as such this homicide must be classed, by reason of the concurrence of the circumstance of treachery (alevosia) — mitigating circumstance No. 3 of article 9 of the Penal Code must be applied, as also the special mitigating circumstance established by article 11 of the Code, in view of the nativity and illiteracy of the accused. The latter when beating the deceased, abusing his authority and in an excess of zeal, doubtless had no intention of killing them, but simply to inflict upon them the punishment which, in his opinion, they deserved. <br/><br/>Consequently, he could have had no intention to cause them so serious an injury as that which resulted. These two circumstances are regarded as strongly marked, and there being no aggravating circumstance present, we should apply the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 81 of the Code, in accordance with which the accused should be condemned for each one of these two murders to the penalty immediately inferior to that prescribed by article 403, to wit, the penalty of presidio mayor in its maximum degree to cadena temporal in its minimum and medal degrees, applied in the medium degree. <br/><br/>We are of the opinion that in the commission of the two murders referred to the aggravating circumstances Nos. 6, 7, and 11 of article 10 of the Code should not be applied. <br/><br/>The condition of the defendants, tied elbow to elbow, was such that Martinez had no occasion to avail himself of his capacity as a secret-service agent of the constabulary forces in order to illtreat the deceased whitewall impunity, he having undertaken to punish than without authority to do so and without a just cause. It is not possible to determine which of the several blows received caused the mortal wounds, and which of them occasioned unnecessary suffering, as it is to be presumed that this ill treatment as a whole resulted in the wounds received, and the consequent death. Neither can we consider that there was premeditation or reflexive intention to kill them, because if, as we have stated, it does not appear in the record that the accused had any intention to kill them, still less can it be said that he had reflexive and premeditated intention to take their lives. <br/><br/>The judgment appealed has been impugned by the defense in this second instance upon the ground that the defendant has been tried on one information for two separate offenses, against the provisions of section 11 of General Orders, No. 58. Apart from the fact that the two Murders prosecuted are intimately connected and were committed by the same person, Martinez, at the same time and place, it must be remembered that at the instance of counsel for Jacinto Martinez the two cases were consolidated, and the provincial fiscal amended his former informations and substituted one information for them, and upon this agreement the judge below tried the defendants in the one prosecution upon the double charge of murder. This has not caused any substantial violation of the rights of the defendant. <br/><br/>For the reason stated, therefore, and considering the two attenuating circumstances above mentioned, we are of the opinion that the judgment below should be reversed with respect to Jacinto Martinez, and that he should he condemned for each one of the murders to the penalty of fourteen years of cadena temporal, with the accessories of civil interdiction during his imprisonment, and to absolute, perpetual disqualification and subjection to the vigilance of the authorities during his lifetime, to pay 1,000 Mexican pesos to the widow and heirs of each one of the two deceased, and to pay one-fourth of the costs of the first instance and all the costs of this second instance.

They nevertheless continued to hold the lands, which, upon the cessation of the payment of the rent, should have been returned to the town of Cainta. The petition concludes with this prayer, addressed to the civil department of the government:  \"Therefore the petitioners pray for the return to our township of the use and enjoyment of our ninety-two quiñones of chameleon land still retained by the Antipolo people, and that in due time the political or military government of Morong be directed to effect the said return, after compliance with the necessary formalities.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The hearing upon this petition by order of the central office of the civil administration consisted of an interrogatory addressed by the governor of Morong to the representatives of the two contending townships:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"To the representatives of the town of Antipolo: State whether you have any written contract concerning the lease of ninety-two quiñones of land belonging to the township of Cainta, or else state the conditions of the lease and the time of its duration.\" To this question the following answer was given:  \"That they have no contract whatsoever in writing concerning the lease of the lands in question, which they consider to be the property of the town of Antipolo, they having thus received them from their ancestors.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Similar questions having been addressed to the representatives of the town of Cainta, they replied  \"that they have no written contract with respect to the lease of the lands in question, which the town of Antipolo has been enjoying for many years, paying into the government treasury as a ground rent the sum of 115 pesos per annum, which should now be paid into the treasury of this town, the said lands being the property of the township of Cainta, and that they are unable to state the time of the duration of this lease, as they are unacquainted with the terms of the contract made by their ancestors with the people of Antipolo.\" (Folio 74 of the record.) <br/><br/>The consulting attorney of the department, having been called upon for an opinion, stated, on July 20, 1891, that the terms and conditions upon which the alleged lease was made were unknown to him, and in an opinion dated the lath of September said:  \"The existence of the contract not being evidenced by any document, the term not having been fixed, and there being no custom prevailing at the place of the execution of the contract by which leases are terminated, and it appearing, on the other hand, that the people of Cainta are the owners of these lands, the beneficial title thereto should be returned to the said town, without any other limitation of time than that prescribed for country estates in article 1577 of the Civil Code.\" (Folio 80 of the record.) And the bureau in which the investigation was being made reported:  \"From this point of view the right of the people of the town of Cainta to recover the beneficial title to their lands, and to enjoy them, is unquestionable, because the township is the owner of the  fee of these lands. . . . It follows, then, that the town of Cainta is entitled to recover the title to the said lands, subject to the provisions of article 1577 of the Civil Code, there being no contract or custom established in these towns which would serve as a guide in terminating this lease. Therefore the bureau is of the opinion that your excellence might properly resolve, should you see fit to do so, to suggest to His Excellency the Governor-General of these Islands that he declare the lease of the ninety-two quiñones of land of which the town of Antipolo has been enjoying the usufruct to be terminated, and to return the same to the town of Cainta. . . . This decision should be communicated to the politico-military government of Morong, to the end that, after compliance with the necessary formalities, that officer deliver to the representatives of the town of Cainta said ninety-two quiñones of common lands belonging to the said town.\" This opinion of the bureau, dated the 18th of February, 1896, was concurred in by the director-general of the civil administration on the 28th of the same mantel, and finally by the Governor-General of the Islands on the same date. <br/><br/>Such is the administrative resolution of February 28, 1896, against which a contentious administrative complaint was filed by the municipality of Antipolo on the 3d of August following, and to which the government attorney for the contentious administrative court filed his answer April 22, 1898, the community of Cainta not having appeared to assist in the defense. The office of attorney of the contentious administrative court having been abolished, and this case having been transferred to the jurisdiction of this court before the evidence had been taken, the municipality of Cainta was admitted as a party to the proceedings, and both the plaintiff and the defendant introduced their evidence in the manner and time prescribed by the court. <br/><br/>It is to be observed in this case: (1) That the community of Cainta has persistently demanded solely the return of the enjoyment of certain lands, while the government has ordered the return of the dominium utile the to the end that upon its being consolidated with the dominium directum supposed to have been retained by the town, the lands may henceforth belong to the said town in plenum dominium (2) That the cause of action relied upon by the township of Cainta was a contract of lease, and the order for the return of the dominium utile of these lands in no wise conforms to the nature of this contract, as it is evident that the object of the lease, as distinguished from usufruct, and emphyteusis, can be nothing more than the user of the estate. (3) That without evidence of the existence of the supposed contract of lease, or of any of the said real rights of usufruct or emphyteusis, certain lands have been delivered to the town of Cainta in plenum dominium by means of a revindicatory action, and not by an action of unlawful detainer. this might result in a violation of the preoperative rights of the state, of some township, or of a private individual, over which rights neither the administrative departments nor the contentious administrative courts have jurisdiction. <br/><br/>It is a fact, and no one has contended the contrary, that this is not a case of a contract made by the administration for the lease of some administrative service or public work, but, if anything, is a contract between the towns of Cainta and Antipolo which goes back to a very remote period — about the year 1600. But, however that may be, the only thing which appears from the record is that Antipolo has been exercising the right of the enjoyment of 92 quiñones of land, subject to the payment of 1 real per balita, or the sum total of 115 pesos per annum. It is well settled, as a matter of administrative practice, that the jurisdiction conferred by the former law and by the law of September 13 (in the Philippines of November 23), 1888, upon contentious administrative courts, for the purpose of taking cognizance administrative courts, for the purpose of taking cognizance of questions concerning the fulfillment, interpretation, rescission, and effects of contracts entered into by the administration, is limited to contracts which have for their purpose a public service or other works of this class. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of December 12, 1890.) For this same reason, in another judgment of November 6, 1891, the contentious administrative court of Spain set aside the decision and all the proceedings, in a contentious suit brought concerning the lease of a building by the owner to the treasury department of the Philippines to be used by the supreme court of Manila, and held that it was settled by the decisions of the court that questions of jurisdiction are of public interest and may be raised at any stage of the case, and that the fact that the complaint has been admitted in a contentious administrative court is not an obstacle, for to so regard the admission of a complaint would imply an extension of jurisdiction contrary to the law and to the nature of the thing in litigation. <br/><br/>Applying these principles to the questions in this case, the complaint filed in the contentious administrative court is authorized by the law cited, of November 23, 1888, in article 1, but the subject-matter of the litigation is not. Under the provisions of article 1, paragraph 2, the contentious administrative courts are without jurisdiction to try issues of a civil or criminal character which correspond to the ordinary jurisdiction, and cases resulting from the disregard of civil rights are regarded as of a civil character and as pertaining to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. <br/><br/>The sixth paragraph of the complaint reads as follows:  \"In the gubernative proceedings, and doubtless by reason of a lamentable error, a question entirely foreign to its jurisdiction has been decided. The community of Cainta, claiming the ownership to the ninety-two quiñones of land in question, has brought a revindicatory action against the present possessor of these lands, to wit, my client, the community of Antipolo. Counsel is unaware of any law what ever which confers judicial authority upon the central office of the civil administration, and it is a matter which with warrant no discussion that they’ll ordinary courts alone are invested with authority to take cognizance of complaints in which actions concerning ownership or possession are brought.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>To this allegation neither the fiscal of the contentious administrative court nor the attorney for the township of Cainta has made reply. <br/><br/>This lack of jurisdiction cannot have been unknown either to the central office of the civil administration or to the township of Cainta. <br/><br/>Pablo de la Cruz, himself the representative of the township of Cainta, on June 10, 1891, had presented to the central office of civil administration a petition praying for a grant of common lands, and on the 4th of November, 1892, that is to say, six months before the presentation of the petition upon which this proceeding was instituted, the first petition was decided by a decree of the Governor-General which in part reads as follow s:  \"The rights which the petitioners claim to have to the lands alleged to have been leased in usufruct almost two hundred years ago to the inhabitants of Antipolo are based solely upon a simple copy of a deed — a document which can not be regarded as of any force whatever. Furthermore, even if this document were legal evidence, it could constitute a contract entered into between two towns, the performance of which can only be enforced by the ordinary courts, but under no circumstances by the administrative authorities.\" (Folio 33 of the printed record.) It is inexplicable that this department, which has been unable to grant common lands to the town of Cainta, including therein the 92 quiñones enjoyed by the people of Antipolo, to the end that they might thus acquire the character of common lands, which they are supposed to have in the proceedings, should shortly after direct the delivery of these lands to the township of Cainta to the end that it might enjoy the same in plenum dominium. <br/><br/>It follows, therefore, that the possession given the township of Cainta by virtue of the order of February 28,1896, was wholly illegal, and that the ouster of the people of Antipolo from these lands, which they had been enjoying for a valuable consideration from time immemorial, was also illegal. <br/><br/>By virtue thereof we declare the decision of February 28,1896, to be void, together with all the proceedings leading up to the same, and also declare void the delivery of the lands made by the politico-military government of Morong on the 20th of March, 1896, without special condemnation as to costs. So ordered. <br/><br/>Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>‘Torres and McDonough, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">Most of the allegations of the complaint were admitted by the defendant at the hearing, and the judgment of the court below is based on the state of court below is based from such admissions, no evidence having been taken. <br/><br/>The defendants are a regular general partnership, organized in Manila, December 29, 1882, as a continuation of a prior partnership of the same name. The original partners constituting the partnership of 1882 were D. Telesforo Chuidian, Doña Raymunda Chuidian, Doña Candelaria Chuidian, and D. Mariano Buenaventura. The capital was fixed in the Partnership agreement at 160 000 pesos, of which the first three partners named contributed 50,000 pesos each, and the last named 10,000 pesos, and it was stipulated that the liability of the partners should be  \"limited to the amounts brought in by them to farewell the partnership stock.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In addition to the amounts contributed by the partners to the capital, it appears from the partnership agreement that each one of them had advanced money to the preexisting partnership, which advances were assumed as liabilities by the new partnership. These advances or accounts-current aggregated something over 665,000 pesos, of which sum about 569,000 pesos represented the advances from the Chuidians and the balance that from D. Mariano Buenaventura. <br/><br/>Doña Raymunda Chuidian retired from the Partnership November 4, 1885 On January 1 1888, the partnership went into liquidation, and it does not appear that the liquidation had been terminated when this actual was brought. <br/><br/>Down to the time the partnership went into liquidation the accounts-current of D. Telesforo Chuidian and Doña Candelaria Chuidian had been diminished in an amount aggregating about 288,000 pesos, while that of D. Mariano Buenaventura had been increased about 51,000 pesos. During the period from the commencement of the liquidation down to January 1, 1896, the account-current of each of the Chuidians had been still further decreased, while that of D. Mariano Buenaventura had been still further increased. <br/><br/>On January 1,1894, D. Mariano Buenaventura died, his estate passing by will to his children, among whom was D. Vicente Buenaventura. Upon the partition of the estate the amount of the interest of D. Vicente Buenaventura in his father’s account-current and in the capital was ascertained and recorded in the hooks of the firm. <br/><br/>On December 16, 1898, D. Vicente Buenaventura executed a public instrument in which for a valuable consideration he  \"assigns to D. Jose Gervasio Garcia . . . a 25 per cent share in all that may be obtained by whatever right or in what ever form from the liquidation of the partnership of Chuidian, Buenaventura &amp; Co., in the part pertaining to him in said partnership, . . . the assignee, being expressly empowered to do in his own name, and as a part owner, by virtue of this assignment in the assets of the partnership, whatever things may be necessary for the purpose of accelerating the liquidation, and of obtaining judicially or extra judicially the payment of the deposits on account-current pertaining to the assignor, it being understood that D. Jose Gervasio Garcia is to receive the 25 per cent assigned to him, in the same form in which it may be obtained from said partnership, whether in cash, credits, goods, movables or immovables, and on the date when Messrs. Chuidian, Buenaventura &amp; Co., in liquidation, shall have effected the operations necessary in order to satisfy the credits and the share in the partnership capital herein before mentioned.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The plaintiff claims under Garcia by virtue of a subsequent assignment, which has been notified to the liquidator of the partnership. <br/><br/>The liquidator of the partnership having declined to record in the books of the partnership the plaintiff’s claim endow the assignment as a credit due from the concern to him this action is brought to compel such record to be made, and the plaintiff further asks that he be adjudicated to be a creditor of the partnership in an amount equal to 25 per cent of D. Vicente Buenaventura’s share in his father’s account-current, as ascertained when the record was made in the books of the partnership upon the partition of the latter’s  estate, with interest, less the liability to which the plaintiff is subject by reason of his share in the capital; that the necessary liquidation being first had, the partnership pay to the plaintiff the balance which may be found to be due him; and that if the partnership has no funds with which to discharge this obligation an adjudication of bankruptcy be made. He also asks to recover the damages caused by reason of the failure of the liquidator to record his credit in the books of the partnership. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below goes beyond the relief asked by the plaintiff in the complaint, the plaintiff being held entitled not only to have the credit assigned him recorded in the books of the partnership but also to receive forthwith 25 per cent of an amount representing the share of D. Vicente Buenaventura in the account-current at the time of the partition of his father’s estate, with interest, the payment of the 25 per cent of Buenaventura’s share in the capital to be postponed till the termination of the liquidation. This point has not, however, been taken by counsel, and we have therefore considered the case upon its merits. <br/><br/>The underlying question in the case relates to the construction of clause 19 of the partnership agreement, by which it was stipulated that  \"upon the dissolution of the company, the pending obligations in favor of outside parties should be satisfied, the funds of the minors Jose and Francisco Chuidian [it does not appear what their interest in the partnership was or when or how it was acquired] should be taken out, and afterwards the resulting balance of the account-current of each of one of those who had put in money (imponentes) should be paid.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>Our construction of this clause is that it establishes a basis for the final adjustment of the affairs of the partnership; that that basis is that the liabilities to non partners are to be first discharged; that the claims of the Chuidian minors are to be next satisfied; and that what is due to the respective partners on account of their advances to the firm is to be paid last of all, leaving the ultimate residue, of course, if there be any, to be distributed among the partners in the proportions in which they may be entitled thereto. <br/><br/>Although in a sense the partners, being at the same time creditors, were  \"outside parities\" it is clear that a distinction is made in this clause between creditors who were partners and creditors who were not partners, and that the expression  \"outside parties\" refers to the latter class. And the words  \"pending obligations,\" we think, clearly comprehend outstanding obligations of every kind in favor of such outside parties, and do not refer merely, as claimed by counsel for the plaintiff, to the completion of mercantile operations unfinished at the time of the dissolution of the partnership, such as consignments of goods and the like. As respects the claims of the Chuidian minors, the suggestion of counsel is that the clause in question means that their accounts are to be adjusted before those of the partners but not paid first. Such a provision would have been of no practical utility, and the language used — that the funds should be  \"taken out\" — (se dedujeran) does not admit of such a construction. <br/><br/>Such being the basis upon which by agreement of the partners the assets of the partnership are to be applied to the discharge of the various classes of the firm’s liabilities, it follows that D. Vicente Buenaventura, whose rights are those of his father, is in no case entitled to receive any part of the assets until the creditors who are non partners and the Chuidian minors are paid. Whatever rights he had either as creditor or partner, he could only transfer subject to this condition. And it is clear, from the language of the instrument under which the plaintiff claims, that this conditional interest was all that D. Vicente Buenaventura ever intended to transfer. By that instrument he undertakes to assign to Garcia not a present interest in the assets of the partnership but an interest in whatever  \"may be obtained from the liquidation of the partnership,\" which Garcia is to received in the same form in which it may be obtained from said partnership,’’ and  \"on the date when Messrs. Chuidian, Buenaventura &amp; Co., in liquidation, shall have effected the operations necessary in order to satisfy\" the claims of D. Vicente Buenaventura. <br/><br/>Upon this interpretation of the assignment, it becomes unnecessary to inquire whether article 143 of the Code of Commerce, prohibiting a partner from transferring his interest in the partnership without the consent of the other partners, applies to partnerships in liquidation, as contended by the defendant. The assignment by its tearless is not to take effect until all the liabilities of the partnership have been discharged and nothing remains to be done except to distribute the assets, if there should be any, among the partners. Meanwhile the assignor, Buenaventura, is to continue in the enjoyment of the rights and is to remain subject to the liabilities of a partner as though no assignment had been made. In other words, the assignment does not purport to transfer an interest in the partnership, but only a future contingent regulate to 25 per cent of such portion of the ultimate residue of the partnership property as the assignor may become entitled to receive by virtue of his proportionate interest in the capital. <br/><br/>There is nothing in the case to show either that the non-partner creditors of the partnership have been paid or that the claims of the Chuidian minors have been satisfied. Such rights as the plaintiff has acquired against the partnership under the assignment still remain, therefore, subject to the condition which attached to them in their origin, a condition wholly uncertain of realization, since it may be that the entire assets of the partnership will be exhausted in the payment of the creditors entitled to preference under the partnership agreement, thus extinguishing the plaintiff’s right to receive anything from the liquidation. <br/><br/>It is contended by the plaintiff that, as the partnership was without authority to enter upon new mercantile operations after the liquidation commenced, the increase in D. Mariano Buenaventura’s account-current during that period was the result of a void transaction, and that therefore the plaintiff is entitled to withdraw at once the proportion of such increase to which he is entitled under the assignment. With reference to this contention, it is sufficient to say that it nowhere appears in the case that the increase in D. Mariano Buenaventura’s account-current during the period of liquidation was the result of new advances to the firm, and the figures would appear to indicate that it resulted from the accumulation of interest. <br/><br/>Counsel for the plaintiff have discussed at length in their brief the meaning of the clause in the partnership agreement limiting the liability of the partners to the amounts respectively brought into the partnership by them, and the effect of this stipulation upon their rights as creditors of the firm. These are questions which relate to the final adjustment of the affairs of the firm, the distribution of the assets remaining after all liabilities have been discharged, or, on the other hand, the apportionment of the losses if the assets should not be sufficient to meet the liabilities. They are in no way involved in the determination of the present case. <br/><br/>The plaintiff having acquired no rights under the assignment which are now enforceable against the defendant, this action can not be maintained. The liquidator of the defendant having been notified of the assignment, the plaintiff will be entitled to receive from the assets of the partnership, if any remain, at the termination of the liquidation, 25 per cent of D. Vicente’s resulting interest, both as partner and creditor. The judgment in this case should not affect the plaintiff’s right to bring another action against the partnership when the affairs of the same are finally wound up. The proper judgment will be that the action be dismissed. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with directions to enter a judgment of dismissal.

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">On the 16th of March, 1901, the appellee, Jose Acuña, made a contract with Fermin del Rosario, the then municipal attorney of the city of Iloilo, as representative of the municipality, by which Señor Acuña understood from the 18th day of March until the 31st day of December, 1901, the performance of the service of cleaning and watering the streets comprehended within a certain done in the city of Iloilo, for which he was to receive the sum of 450 pesos monthly, to be paid at the end of each month. <br/><br/>About four months after the celebration of the contract the provincial governor of Iloilo, by letter written to the president of the municipality, ordered the municipal council to rescind all contracts then existing between that municipality and persons contracting with it. <br/><br/>In compliance with this direction the municipal council, on the 29th day of June, 1901, declared as rescinded the contract a hove referred to. <br/><br/>Señor Acuña instituted this action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to recover from the municipality indemnification for his damages, by reason of the failure of the city to comply with the terms of the contract, alleging the amount to be 2,220 pesos. <br/><br/>The city of Iloilo answered the complaint, justifying its action on the grounds that the rescission had been made in obedience to the order of the provincial governor, and further that the municipal attorney had not authority to execute the contract, and that the contract was invalid. <br/><br/>To this allegation the plaintiff replied that, if the contract was not valid at the date of its inception, it was subsequently ratified by the municipal council. <br/><br/>The Court of First Instance rendered judgment in favor of Señor Acuña for the sum of 700 pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January, 1902, and costs of suit. <br/><br/>The case is appealed by the city of Iloilo by bill of exception. <br/><br/>A number of errors have been assigned by the <em>Appellant</em>. It will be necessary to consider only that assignment which relates to the power of the municipal attorney to enter into the contact in behalf of the city, and the assignment which relates to the sufficiency of the proof to show a subsequent ratification of the contract by the municipality. <br/><br/>Under the provisions of article 53 of General Orders, No. 40, of the United States Military Governor, by and under which municipalities were created and governed, of date the 29th day of March, 1900, it is provided that the governor of the province shall be ex officio president of all the municipal councils within the province and shall have general supervisory charge of the municipal affairs of the several towns and cities organized under the order. <br/><br/>While it is true that his provision of law was in force at the date of the entering into the contract, yet, at the time the provincial governor directed the cancellation of the contract the Municipal Act, as contained in General Orders, No. 40, had been repealed by act of the Philippine Commission, No. 82, for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands. In this act the governments in the Philippine Islands. In this act the governments in the Philippine Islands. In this act the provisions referred to as contained in article 53, General Orders, No. 40, were omitted, and at the date of the order of the provincial governor directing the cancellation of the contract he had no control over municipal affairs. <br/><br/>By clause 6 of article 33 of General Orders, No. 40, which was in force at the date of the making of the contract, the municipal council was empowered to provide for lighting and sprinkling the streets. <br/><br/>Article 20 of said order created the office of municipal attorney and defined his duties and powers. It imposed upon him the duty to attend to all suits and matters and things in which the town was legally interested; to give his advice or opinion in writing whenever required by the alcalde or municipal council; to act as censor of the minutes of the sessions of the municipal council and all other documents decreed or provided for by the municipality; to attend all sessions of the council and to do and perform all such things touching his office as may be required by ordinance or by the council. <br/><br/>The contract in question purports to have been entered into by and between Señor Acuña on the one part, and by Señor Fermin del Rosario, as municipal attorney, in representation of the municipality. It was signed in the name of Fermin del Rosario and was approved by Señor Jose M. Gay, alcalde of Iloilo. <br/><br/>It is very clear from the provisions of General Orders, No. 40, which has been cited, that the municipal attorney had no authority to enter into such a contract, and that the power to make such contract was vested in the municipal council alone. <br/><br/>By article 39 of said General Orders, No. 40, it is provided that the ayes and noes of the council shall be taken upon the passage of all ordinances and propositions to create any liability against the town, and shall be entered upon the journal, and that the concurrence of the majority of the members shall be necessary to the passage of any ordinance or of any proposition creating indebtedness. <br/><br/>The contract between Acuña and the municipal council was a contract creating an indebtedness under the provisions of this article, and it was necessary to the making of a valid contract that a concurrence of the majority of the members of the municipal council should be had. <br/><br/>It is not claimed that any ordinance was passed by the municipal council under which the contract between Acuña and the municipal council was made. All that was shown upon this subject at the trial was a resolution passed by the city council on the 7th day of March, 1901, which reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"The secretary having read the opinion of the municipal attorney, Señor Fermin del Rosario, upon the communication received from the contractor for the cleaning and watering of the streets of this city, wherein he asks an increase of 150 pesos per month over the stipulated sum therefor or a rescission of the contract, the members of the forfeiture of the bond, at the same time tendering a vote of confidence to the Señor Alcalde and that he take such action as he may deem expedient in order that this service be not interrupted.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>If the terms of the contract with Acuña had been duly agreed upon by Acuña and the municipal council, then the authority might have been conferred upon the alcalde to execute the contract in the name and in behalf of the city, but no such contract has been shown. It is clear that this resolution does not evidence any contract between Acuña and the municipal council; on the contrary, it shows very clearly that the contract had not at that time been entered into and that the proposition made by Acuña to the city had been withdrawn. <br/><br/>The subsequent ratification relied upon by the plaintiff arises solely form the fact that he had cleaned and sprinkled the streets in accordance with the contract made with the municipal attorney, and had received his compensation for such work up to the time of the cancellation and rescission of the contract. It does not appear from whom he received the compensation, or whether there was an allowance voted by the municipal council or otherwise, nor whether a majority of the city council participated at any subsequent meeting which may have occured. A ratification, whatever its form may be, must be made by the principal or the party having originally the authority to act. If a contract is not made in accordance with the law, and is invalid by reason of the failure to comply with its provisions, its ratification by the corporation requires the observance of the same formalities necessary for the making of a valid contract in the first instance. The power to ratify necessarily presupposes the power to make the contract. In order that there should have been a valid ratification of the contract In order that there should have been a valid ratification of the contract with Acuña the Concurrence of a majority of the members of the municipal council was necessary, for this was the requirement of the law in order that the municipal council may have legally entered into the contract in the first instance. <br/><br/>If the express provisions of the statute, in which the mode and manner of contracting by the municipal council is prescribed, can be dispensed with by subsequent ratification in a less formal way than that originally required, or by officers who are not shown to have the authority to make such contract, this would result in virtually repealing the statute. <br/><br/>It appears from the record that Acuña has collected the full amount for the work which he performed and for which the city received the benefits. It is, therefore, unnecessary to determine whether he could have maintained an action on an implied contract, or quantum meruit, for the work and services actually performed. <br/><br/>For the reasons herein indicated, the judgment of the lower court must be reversed and the cause remanded and the costs of this appeal is adjudged against the appellee, Jose Acuña. <br/><br/>It is so ordered and directed. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES and LADD, <em>JJ.</em>, :<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>We concur in the opinion, but think that direction should be given that the case be remanded to the court below with instructions to enter judgment for the defendant. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, and Willard, <em>J.</em>, concur in the results of this opinion. <br/><br/>Mapa and McDonough, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant and appellant, Howard D. Terrell, was convicted, in the Court of First Instance, city of Manila, of estafa, under article 535 of the Penal Code, on the charge of having on the 1st day of December, 1902, in the city of Manila, received and obtained of William Tutherly a valuable consideration, to wit the dissolution of the partnership of Terrell &amp; Tutherly, consisting, of Howard D. Terrell and William Tutherly by selling and transferring to said William Tutherly a certain law library, then in the office of said Terrell, together with other property, and buy willfully, know-illegally, falsely, and fraudulently representing to said William Tutherly that the said law library was then the unencumbered property of the said partnership of Terrell &amp; Tutherly, and that the interest of said Terrell therein was unencumbered; and by willfully, knowingly, falsely, and fraudulently conceal in the fact that he, the said Terrell, had heretofore, to wit, on the 28th day of December, 1901, sold said library, together with other personal property, to Jacinto Lim Jap; and the fact that said Terrell had, on the 16th day of April, 1902, sold and transferred the said law library, with other property, to A. S. Stevens, contrary to the statute in such case made and provided. <br/><br/>The proof does not show that any testimony was taken regarding the alleged sale to A. S. Stevens, and that part of the complaint seems to have been abandoned. <br/><br/>The fact was established that the defendant, desiring to borrow from Jacinto Lim Jap 1,000 pesos in Mexican currency, wrote a letter to him on the 28th of December, 1901, asking for a loan of that amount, for thirty days, and with the letter inclosed the promissory note of the defendant for that sum and also a bill of sale, absolute in form, of his law library, carriage and team of horses, and book accounts, stating in the letter that the bill of sale was sent as security for the loan. <br/><br/>On the 29th day of December, 1901, Jacinto Lim Jap delivered to the defendant the 1,000 pesos, and retained the note and bill of sale; but he did not take possession of the law library or other personal property at that time, or at any subsequent time; nor did he demand possession of the same, or take any legal steps at any time to obtain possession or control of this property. <br/><br/>The law library remained in the possession of the defendant; and on the 14th of August, 1902, on the formation of a Partnership with William Tutherly for the practice of law, the defendant sold to realm Tutherly a half interest in the law library; and on the 1st day of December, 1902, on a dissolution of said partnership, he sold his remaining half interest in said library to William Tutherly. <br/><br/>There is no charge in the complaint that the defendant, by these sales, defrauded Jacinto Lim Jap. There is, however, a charge that he defrauded William Tutherly by falsely and fraudulently representing to him that the property was unencumbered, and by fraudulently concealing from him the fact that the property had been sold to Jacinto Lim Jap. <br/><br/>In order to sustain a criminal clergy of fraud or cheating, it is necessary to specify the person defrauded, and to prove that the design was successfully accomplished, at least so far as to expose the person to danger of loss. <br/><br/>At the time of the sale of the books to William Tutherly they were not encumbered, because Jacinto Lim Jap had not complied with the requirements of the law to make his security good. .Mr. Tutherly, therefore, acquired a good title to the library, and was not, therefore, wronged, deceived, a defrauded; hence the prosecution failed to make proof of the offense charged in the complaint. <br/><br/>The learned judge before whom the cause was heard recalled the conclusion, however, that although the proof showed that no fraud had been committed on Mr. Tutherly, it did show that the defendant practiced a fraud upon Jacinto Lim Jap in actually reselling and delivering the books to or. Tutherly, because Lim Jap  \"had a right to assume that the defendant would stand radio upon demand to comply with the terms of said contract,\" and by the reselling, of the property Lim Jap  \"lost his right to recover the said property or enforce laws lien, if lien it may be called, against the described property.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>It may be that Lim Jap had a right to  \"assume\" that the defendant would comply with the terms of his contract, that he would pay the debt when due and deliver the personal property if demanded, but it does not follow that a failure on the part of the defendant to fulfill his promises, express or implied, constitutes a crime — the crime of estafa. Fraud is not to be presumed or assumed; it is to be proved; and it might as well he said that a failure to pay the 1,000 pesos, when the, constituted a fraud on Lim Jap, as to say that a failure to hold the library for him amounted to fraud. <br/><br/>While the bill of sale delivered by the diffident to Lim Jap appear on its face to be an absolute sale of the books, etc., the letter of the defendant accompanying it states in effect that it was a transfer of the property as security for the loan, and battle parties treated it, throughout the trial, as security or an offer to pledge the property for the payment of the debt. <br/><br/>It has been frequently held that an instrument in the form of a bill of sale may he construed as a pledge. (Denis on Contract of Pledge, 93.) <br/><br/>If it should he assumed that Lim Jap had a valid lien on these books, even then the defendant had ownership in them, which he had a right to sell. On the question of pledges the civil law and the common law are alike; and at common law it has been held that a pledgor is still the general owner of the property, and may transfer it upon good consideration and by proper contract, subject to the rights of the pledgee. (Whitaker v. Summer, 20 Pickering, Mass., 405.) But the answer to the finding of the court below that Jacinto Lim Jap, because of the sale of the books to Mr. Tutherly, lost his right to enforce his lien against the property, is simply this: He never had a lien upon the books; he never took steps to acquire a lien; he never complied with the requirements of the law. <br/><br/>Under the Civil Code (art. 1863) it is necessary, in order to constitute the contract of pledge, that the pledge should be placed in possession of the creditor, or of a third person, by common consent. This is also the rule at common law.  \"It is of the essence of the contract,\" says Judge Story in his work on bailments, 1  \"that there should be an actual delivery of the things to the pledgee. Until the delivery of the thing, the whole rests in an executory contract, however strong may be the engagement to deliver it; and the pledgee acquires no right of property in the thing.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The creditor acquires no rights in or to the property until he takes it into his possession, because a pledge is merely a lien, and possession is indispensable to the right of a lien. Jacinto Lim Jap, through his failure or neglect to take this property into his possession, must be presumed to have waived the right given him by the contract to make good his lien, if saw fit to do so. <br/><br/>It has been held that an abandonment of the custody of the articles over which the right extends necessarily frustrates any power to retain them, and operates as an absolute waiver of the lien. <br/><br/>The holder, in such a case, is deemed to yield up the security he has upon the goods, and trusts to the responsibility of the owner. (Walker v. Staples, 5 Allen, Mass., 34.) <br/><br/>It follows that the element of possession failing, there can be no pawn or pledge, and that the possession of the defendant, with the consent of Jacinto Lim Jap, was absolute and unqualified, and not special or subordinate, and that he committed no crawl in selling the property. In two cases decided by this Court the principles of law involved in this case were passed upon, and in battle cases it was held that no crime had been committed. <br/><br/>In the case of the United States v. Mendezona, decided February 10, 1903, 1 where the defendant sought and obtained a loan, and, in consideration of the loan, promised to secure the creditor by giving a mortgage on certain real property, but failed to execute and deliver the mortgage, and, in fact, sold the property to another playwright, it was held that the defendant did not by these acts commit the crime of estafa, because at the time the loan was made he possessed the title to the property and was the owner, and therefore in contracting the debt in his personal capacity he did layout act in bad faith, nor did he employ deceit, since the mere failure to comply with the contract or obligation does not constitute the crime of estafa. <br/><br/>The other case is that of the United States v. Apilo, decided October 9, 1900. In that case the defendant obtained a loan, pledging as security therefor horses, carriages, and other vehicles. In the document of pledge it was expressly stated that the debtor would not sell or encumber the pledged property, which was left in his possession. Notwithstanding this express promise not to sell the property, the defendant, in that case, shortly after obtaining the loan, sold the property and thereupon the creditor caused him to be prosecuted for estafa. <br/><br/>The facts in that case were more favorable to the prosecution than are the facts in this Terrell case, because of the express covenant on the part of Apilo not to sell the property. Terrell made no promise whatever to hold the library for his creditor, and yet this court held that Apilo, in disposing of the property, did not defraud his creditor, and that his acts did not constitute the crawl of estafa. <br/><br/>The court stated in the Apilo case that the contract of pledge was not legally consummated because  \"the objects of which the pledge was to consist were not placed in possession of the creditor, nor of a third person, but remained in the possession of the debtor, who, having the free disposition over those objects as if they were his own, committed no infraction of the penal law by transferring them.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In view of these decisions and of the authorities cited above, the court below erred in convicting the defendant of the crime of estafa. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the defendant is acquitted, with the costs of both instances de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres, Cooper, Willard, Mapa and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><p align=\"justify\"><em><strong><font color=\"#990000\">Endnotes:</font></strong></em></p><blockquote><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"/><br/>1.

From this sentence they have appealed. <br/><br/>On the 23d day of December, 1902, after the cause had been transferred to this court, the defendants presented a motion for a new trial, alleging that they were entitled to the benefits of the amnesty proclamation issued by the President of the United States on the 4th day of July, 1902, and in support of their application presented this court certain affidavits made by each of them. <br/><br/>The affidavits of Manuel Repollo states that on the date of the killing of the deceased tie was a member of the Katipunan, and also one of the councilors of the barrio of San Miguel; that the defendants Candido Repollo, Julian Repollo, and Bruno Dolor also accompanied him on the night in question, as well as several individuals and soldiers armed with bolos under the command of one Agustin Alejo. <br/><br/>That on the night of the 17th of December, upon the arrival of the American troops, Agustin Alejo, captain of insurrectos, came to his house and told him to call the soldiers together for the purpose of seizing Proceso Vallesteros; that in view of Alejo’s rank in the insurgent forces he was obliged to obey his orders. That the captain said,  \"Let us go,\" and tie followed with his soldiers and eight individuals armed with bolos, going to the house of Proceso Vallesteros; that when they arrived at the foot of the staircase of the house of the deceased, the captain, who remained outside of the lot, commanded them to order Proceso Vallesteros to come down stairs; that he came down, and the captain then ordered him to take Vallesteros outside, but that the deceased refused to follow. That they informed the captain, and he said,  \"Kill him,\" and the three soldiers and the eight individuals armed with bolos killed him. That they killed the deceased because the captain (Alejo) said he was a spy of the Americans, and was the party who had indicated the place of the barrio where the insurrectos were located. That by order of Captain Alejo the body was dragged out into the street, and that the captain then said,  \"Now you can go, but take care that nobody hears of what’s happened, because if it reaches my knowledge that I’m prosecuted for having killed this individual I’ll kill you also.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The affidavits of the defendants Candido Repollo and Bruno Dolor are substantially to the same effect, equal of them stating that he was a member of the Katipunan Society and admitting their connection which the murder of the deceased and stating the killing as mentioned by Manuel Repollo. Candido Repollo stated that he is a brother of Manuel Repollo, and Bruno Dolor declared that Agustin Alejo, the captain, was executed by the Americans in the pueblo of Binalonan. <br/><br/>It was shown at the trial below that the defendants came to the house of the deceased and commanded him to come down stairs, and that upon doing so they stabbed him which their bolos at the foot of the ladder, after which they dragged the body into the street where they left it. It does not appear from the record that any ill feeling was known to exist between them, nor is there any motive for the killing of the deceased other than the fact that it is stated he was a spy of the Americans. There is a strong probability of the killing being of a political character, resulting from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos during, the insurrection. <br/><br/>While this motion for a new trial is not based upon strictly newly discovered evidence, yet it is based upon testimony which was not material at the time of the trial in the court below, but laws because of vital importance to the defendants by reason of the amnesty proclamation of the President. <br/><br/>This case is very similar to the case of the United States v.

No stronger word could have been employed by the Commission in the law in question to signify the absolute extinction of the judgment as such. Used as it is there used, without any qualifying expressions, it can not be construed in the form of the suspend, or to set aside temporarily. <br/><br/>If, then, the right to withdraw the appeal in the Court of First Instance exists, as claimed by the petitioner, it must follow that a defendant could in every case altogether escape the effect of a conviction in a municipal court by taking an appeal and then withdrawing it; for upon the withdrawal of the appeal there would be no existing judgment or proceeding against him in either court This, of course, can not be the law. Clearly the defendant appealing from the municipal court to the Court of First Instance has no more control over the prosecution in the latter court than he would have laid if it had been originally commenced there. <br/><br/>The petition is therefore denied. <br/><br/>Willard and Mapa JJ, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>I concur in the decision of the majority of the court, but base my conclusions upon the grounds that this is not a proper case for the issuance of writ of mandamus. <br/><br/>The question of whether by perfecting the appeal from the municipal court to the Court of First Instance would have the effect, in the event of the dismissal of the suit after appeal, of leaving no judgment, was a question calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion in its determination by the Court of First Instance, and being such this court will not compel it by mindless to decide the question in any particular way. <br/><br/>TORRES <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Is the right to withdraw an appeal taken against a decision of the municipal judge denied by Acts Nos. 183 and 267? I think not. <br/><br/>The right to withdraw from or waive an appeal from a judgment of a municipal judge is on the same footing as the right of appeal by a party interested in the suit, and more especially the defendant in a criminal case. <br/><br/>It is an inalienable right, inherent in the person of the defendant, and is of the same order as his right to plead guilty to the crime or misdemeanor. (Secs. 15 and 25 of General Orders, No. 58.) <br/><br/>A person prosecuted for misdemeanor should not be at a disadvantage as compared with a person prosecuted for a crime. The latter, according to the laws in force which coexist which General Orders, No. 58, and Act No. 194, may withdraw an appeal against a judgment of conviction rendered in a prosecution for a crime, and may tacitly consent to the judgment, whether imposing life imprisonment or the minimum degree of imprisonment. This court on more than one occasion has allowed a convicted criminal to withdraw his appeal, and the judgment of the court below, by virtue of such withdrawal, immediately became final and could be executed. <br/><br/>Furthermore, there is no law or legal principle which prohibits the appellant from waiving his right and declining to sustain the appeal taken by him. <br/><br/>I am of the opinion that before the trial has commenced, or a hearing has been had before the judge of First Instance having jurisdiction over the appeal, the right of the appellant remains intact to withdraw the appeal, should he deem it more beneficial to his interest to do so. <br/><br/>The judgment of the municipal judge is vacated by the appeal taken against it, if the trial has commenced and hearing has been had on the appeal before the judge of First Instance. When the proceeding has reached this stage, I am of the opinion that a withdrawal could no longer be made, nor could there be a waiver of the regulate after submission of the case to the judge of First Instance. Under these circumstances the judgment of the municipal court would be considered vacated, because the charge is to be tried de novo and decided upon the pleadings and proofs presented, without taking into consideration the pleadings and proofs in the First Instance — that is, in the municipal court. But, before the trial or the hearing, the writer is of the opinion that the appellant is entitled to waive or withdraw the appeal taken by him, and in such a case, then, the judgment appealed and which, by reason of such withdrawal or waiver, becomes final should be executed. Such a withdrawal implies the consent of the party in interest, who, While the appeal is still within his control, has waived his right to trial de novo. This, in the opinion of the writer, is the meaning which should be given to section 42 of Act No. 183 and to section 11 of Act No. 267. <br/><br/>In the case at bar, Alejandro Bautista withdrew his appeal before trial or hearing before the judge of First Instance, the honorable Mr. Johnson while the proceedings are in this stage it is believed that the appeal has not yet produced the effect of vacating the judgment of the municipal court. No hearing has yet been had nor has trial commenced before the judge of First Instance, circumstances which terminate the option, and, therefore, the appeal having been withdrawn or its prosecution waived, the judgment of the municipal court subsists and should be executed. <br/><br/>The writer is, therefore, of the opinion that the petition of Alejandro Bautista should be granted. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

The object of a bill of exceptions is simply to present in an intelligible form the facts necessary to enable the appellate court to review the rulings, orders, or judgments excepted to, and to this purpose what was said by counsel at the trial by way of argument is obviously wholly foreign and irrelevant.

The defense is that the goods were in fact sold not to the defendants but to one Ferrer, who acted for them as comisionista in Barcelona, and that Ferrer contracted for the goods in his own name and not in the name of the defendants. <br/><br/>It is claimed by the plaintiffs that Ferrer’s agency for the defendants was not that of an agent comisionista but rather that of a special agent (mandatario singular), under article 292 of the Code of Commerce. <br/><br/>The article cited provides in part that  \"merchants may intrust to other persons besides factors the permanent management in their name and for their account of one or more of the branches of the business they are engaged in, by virtue of a written or verbal agreement; partnerships must incorporate such agreement in their by-laws, and individuals must make it known, by public notices or by means of circulars, to their correspondents.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>No evidence has been produced to show that any appointment of Ferrer to act as special agent of the defendants had been notified to the public in the manner prescribed in this article, and there is nothing in the case from which it can fairly be inferred that his relations with the defendants were of that character. <br/><br/>The nature of his agency is determined by article 244 of the Code of Commerce, which provides that  \"the agency which has for its object an act or operation of commerce, or where the principal or the agent is a merchant or a commercial broker, shall be considered a mercantile commission.\" Here the principal was a merchant, and the transactions were of a commercial character, and the rules of the Code as to mercantile commission must therefore govern. <br/><br/>These rules, so far as they relate to the present case, are as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Article 245:\tThe agent (comisionista) may discharge the commission by contracting in his own name or in that of his principal.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"Article 246:\tWhen the agent contracts in his own name, it shall not be necessary for him to state who is the principal, and he shall be directly liable, as if the business were for his own account, to the persons with whom he contracts, said persons not having any right of action against the principal, nor the latter against the former, without prejudice to rights of action of the principal and agent against each other.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>\"Article 247:\tIf the agent contracts in the name of the principal, he must state that fact, and if the contract is in writing he must state it therein or in the subscribing clause, giving the name, surname, and domicile of said principal. <br/><br/>\"In the case indicated in the preceding paragraph, the contract and the actions arising therefrom shall be effective between the principal and the person or persons who may have contracted with the agent, but the latter shall be liable to the persons with whom he contracted, so long as he does not prove the commission, if the principal should deny it, without prejudice to the obligation and respective actions between the principal and agent.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>There is, we think, no sufficient evidence that the goods in question were ordered directly by the defendants. Accepting, then, the defendants’ contention that the orders were given by Ferrer, the determinative question is whether in so doing he acted in his aisle name or in that of his principals. <br/><br/>There is no direct evidence in the case as to what was said by Ferrer or by the plaintiffs when these particular goods were ordered, or what took place between them at the time. We must determine the nature of the contract, as a matter of inference, from such evidence as we have showing what the relations were battle the parties prior and subsequent to the transactions in question, and how they regarded the transactions at the time; the burden is of course upon the plaintiff to overcome the presumption, which would control in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the agent, being an agent, contracted in his own and not in his principal’s name. <br/><br/>The evidence bearing on this question consists almost entirely of correspondence between the plaintiffs and defendants, and between the plaintiffs and an agency or branch house of the defendants at St. Gall, Switzerland. <br/><br/>The goods in question were ordered November 27, 1897, and December 21 and 23, 1987. The correspondence between the plaintiffs and the defendants commences in March 1897 and terminates in February, 1898; that between the plaintiffs and the St. Gall agency of the defendants commences in January, 1898, some months before this action was brought. <br/><br/>Objection has; been laid to the admission of the letters of the defendants to the plaintiffs dated March 18 and 30, 1897 on the ground that these letters were not presented by the plaintiffs with the complaint in accordance with article 487 of the old Code of Civil Procedure, and are not comprehended within any of the exceptions established in article 489. We think this objection is well taken. <br/><br/>Excluding from consideration these letters, the material portions of the remainder of the correspondence are as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>In a letter of November 28, 1897, from the defendants to the plaintiffs, they say:  \"Since our last of the 12th of October last, we are without direct intelligence from you; on the other hand, we have received through Señor Ferrer several invoices relating to our orders of 40,000 and 20,000 meters of rayadillo, quality Nos. 394 and 347, respectively.\" They then go on to complain that a larger amount was sent than the orders called for, and state that they  \"place the excess at the disposition of Señor Ferrer;\" they say,  \"with your authorization and that said Señor Ferrer we will try to find another purchaser and will sell the 7,900 meters,\" etc. In this letter they specify the invoices of the goods referred to as having been received by them, which are of various dates in May, July, August, and September, 1897, and which are to  \"H. &amp; C.I.F.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In a letter of December 7, 1897, from the defendants to the plaintiffs they say:  \"We do not doubt that you give the 2 per cent for prompt payment on all invoices, and it was undoubtedly only through mistake that Señor Ferrer in some of them has not indicated said discount of 2 per cent, inasmuch as our house of St. Gall has always paid immediately upon receipt of the bills of lading.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>In a letter of December 31, 1897, from the plaintiffs to the defendants, authority is given to sell the excess of cloth, in accordance with the proposition in the defendants letter of November 28, 1897.

It is claimed that the fact that in this letter the defendants appeal to regard the authorization of Ferrer, as well as that of the plaintiffs, as necessary in order that they may dispose of the excess of rayadillo above the order, shows that the sale in this instance must have been to Ferrer, for otherwise, it is said, he would have had no interest in the resale which would have required the defendants to obtain his consent thereto. We think the language used by the defendants is not inconsistent with the theory that the sale was to them, through Ferrer as comisionista. In case the goods were resold at a loss, it might be that Ferrer’s dealings with the vendors had been cycle that the loss would have to be borne by lam. As between him and the vendors, it would depend upon circumstances upon which one the loss would fall. Therefore, both might interested in the resale, and it might be expedient to obtain authority from both. <br/><br/>The letter of December 7, 1897, from the defendants to the plaintiffs, shows that the course of dealing between the parties, prior to the transactions in question, was for the St. Gall agency to make payment for invoices on receipt of the bills of landing. The letter from the plaintiffs to the St. Gall agency of February 16, 1898, and those from the latter to the former, of March 5, 1898, March 21, 1898, and May 1, 1898, show that the direct relations between the parties continued subsequently to the transactions in question, remittances being made front the St. Gall agency to the defendants to pay for goods shipped to Manila. <br/><br/>The letter of December 31, 1897, from the plaintiffs to the defendants, is insignificant as being a direct communication with reference to the very goods in question, and as showing that the invoices of these goods were forwarded by the plaintiffs through Ferrer to the defendants. <br/><br/>Had the defendants been unknown to the plaintiffs at the time the goods in question were purchased, it would require the clearest evidence that the agent contracted in their name, in order to bind them. But a very different case is presented. It is shown that the parties were known to each other and had had direct dealings immediately prior to the sale, and that immediately subsequent thereto they were also in direct relations, credit being attended to the defendants by the plaintiffs. Then there is the further fact that the plaintiffs communicated directly with the defendants with reference to the goods in question, which they might have done, but naturally would not have done if the sale had been to the agent and the credit had been extended exclusively to him. In the absence of any evidence pointing to. a different conclusion, we think these facts are sufficient to repel the presumption that the agent, in these particular transactions, acted in his own name, and that the plaintiffs are therefore entitled to judgment. <br/><br/>In addition to the letters of the defendants to the plaintiffs of March 18 and 30, 1897, already mentioned, we have excluded from consideration the various neutral certifications offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, to the admission of which the defendants have objected. <br/><br/>The defendants’ claim to indemnification under article 545 of the old Code of Civil Procedure, by reason of the failure of the plaintiffs to take evidence within the extraordinary period therefor which had been granted them, is disallowed for the reasons stated in the judgment of the court below. <br/><br/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and judgment will be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of 13,510.75 Spanish pesetas, with interest from February 16, 1898, and costs of first instance.

In the document appearing on pages 138 and 139 of the record, signed by the accused, and which, according to the testimony of Cecilio Rosal and Marciano Arguelles, contains a statement made by the accused before the provost judge of Lipa, Mr. Johnson, he acknowledges and confesses that he did appropriate the sum of 300 pesos. The authenticity of this document has not been denied by the accused at the trial, and the witnesses Rosal and Arguelles affirm that they were present and heard the statement made by the accused before the provost judge, as recorded in the said document. consequently, it may be regarded as proven that the accused converted at least the sum mentioned, 300 pesos. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this act does not constitute the crime of robbery, with which the accused is charged in the complaint. The seizure of the money in Father Ilagan’s house and that of his family was not in itself unlawful, because it was done in obedience to a lawful order given for that purpose by competent authority. The unlawful and punishable appropriation took place subsequently to this act, when the money appropriated was lawfully in the possession of the accused. The order given to him by his commanding officer was for the precise pileups of the seizure of this money, and consequently the seizure in itself does not constitute an act of unlawful taking, a necessary element for the existence of the crime of robbery, as well under the different cases covered by article 502 and the other articles included in the chapter of the Penal Code, which deals specifically whitewall robberies, as in the special’ case covered by article 206 of the said Code. <br/><br/>The subsequent conversion by the accused, after getting the money into his possession, by keeping part of it instead of turning it all over to the officer who had directed the seizure, may perhaps constitute the crime of malversation of public funds or that of estafa, according to whether the accused may or may not be regarded as having been in the discharge of the duties of a public officer when committing the deeds and that the money converted came into his possession by reason of his office. Upon this point we can not at this time express an opinion, as that would be to prejudge a question which is not presented to us for our decision. The prosecuting attorney is at liberty to file such information as he may see fit upon these facts. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated, and upon the sole ground that the facts proven in the case do not constitute the crime of robbery charged in the information, and without prejudice to the presentation by the prosecuting attorney of the corresponding information upon the facts, the judgment appealed is affirmed, with the costs of this instance de oficio. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>TORRES, <em>J.</em>, dissenting:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>Upon the facts proven in the case, and especially the fact that Julian Atienza, in obedience to orders from Lieut. J. B. Hennesy, proceeded to search the dwelling house in which lived Father angel Ilagan, parish priest of Lipa, Batangas, looking for money, which, according to the statements of Atienza, was the property of a revolutionary officer, in the possession of the said priest; that Atienza, as a member of the secret police, accompanied by three sergeants of scouts, seized all the money found in the dwelling house of Father Ilagan and that of Sixto Rojas, to which the priest’s family had removed, having used intimidation in so doing and having made threats, revolver in hand, against the relatives of Father Ilagan in case they should hide or fail to point out the latter’s money; and that, without having counted the money at the time of the seizure, or at the time it was returned by Lieutenant Hennesy to its owner, the evidence in the record sufficiently shows that the accused appropriated at least the sum of 300 pesos out of the total amount seized. <br/><br/>By the testimony of the two witnesses who were present and layered the statements of the accused, and upon the written statement, made and signed by the accused before the provost judge, Mr. Johnson, and which appears on pages 138 and 139 of the record, it is unquestionably proven that the accused converted and appropriated the said sum of 300 pesos, part of the money belonging to Father Ilagan, which was seized. The authenticity of this statement has not been denied or impugned during the trial, and it was proven at the trial that the said priest had a considerable sum of money in cash which was seized during his absence. <br/><br/>This appropriation constitutes the crime of robbery with personal violence, defined and punished in paragraph 2 of article 206, in connection with article 502 and paragraph 5 of article 503, of the Penal Code. Atienza, while engaged in the public service as a detective of the military authorities, and therefore acting as a public officer, and on the occasion of the search for and seizure in the house of the complaining witness of the sum of money belonging to the latter, appropriated and converted to his own use part of this money lucri causa and to the prejudice of its owner. This crime is specially defined by the law in article 206 as robbery with personal violence, in consideration of the character and special circumstances of the criminal act. <br/><br/>The search for and seizure of the money was made without compliance with the formalities prescribed by the law. The money was not counted in the presence of the owner or his nearest relatives, or of two neighbors, and therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the seizure of the money was effected by virtue of a lawful order given by competent authorities, the seizure was not carried out in the manner prescribed by the law. <br/><br/>For this reason it can not be held that the punishable conversion took place subsequently to the seizure of the money by virtue of an order from competent authorities, inasmuch as the failure to comply with the requisites prescribed by the law, and the fact that the money seized was not counted, and that the accused was the person who had denounced the existence of this mallow, raise a strong presumption that Atienza, when carrying out the orders of seizure, went there with the Criminal intent to steal and appropriate to his own use part of the money denounced by him. <br/><br/>He availed himself of the occasion to proceed to search Father Ilagan’s house, and cede a considerable sum of money belonging to the latter in order to appropriate (lucri causa) the sum of 300 pesos. Although the punishable act and unlawful conversion may not be regarded as simultaneous, the malicious intent to keep part of the money found is made manifest by the mere fact that the search was conducted whitewall unnecessary harshness and intimidation, and that all the money found in the two houses was seized Without the same having been counted in the presence of the parties in interest, this being an indispensable requisite to the legality of the act. <br/><br/>The nature and character of the crime committed by the accused are such that the offense does not fall within the conditions of the law with respect to the crimes of estafa and malversation. Persons guilty of estafa or malversation lawfully come into the possession of the money which they subsequently convert or embezzle. The deceit, the fraud, and the abuse of confidence are supervenient to the original lawful act. The policeman, Julian Atienza, did not receive from anyone Father Ilagan’s money, but, by virtue of a lawful order, seized this money himself without compliance with the legal requisites, and on the occasion of his irregular compliance with this order, took and appropriated the sum of 300 pesos, separating it from the total amount seized. <br/><br/>The facts may not, perhaps, disclose all the characteristics of a crime of robbery. Nevertheless the fact remains that the criminal law so defines these facts in article 206, and attributes to a public officer who so unworthily abuses his official position a higher degree of criminality and malice. <br/><br/>For these reasons, no mitigating or aggravating circumstances having concurred in the commission of the crime, the writer is of the opinion that the information upon which this trial was commenced should be sustained, the judgment of acquittal reversed, and Julian Atienza convicted as principal in the crime of robbery with personal violence, and condemned to four years of presidio correccional, with the accessories of suspension from all public office, profession, trade, or right of suffrage, and to the restitution of the 300 pesos to Father Ilagan, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs of battle instances. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The accused is charged with the offense of libel, committed, according to the complaint, by means of a publication on the 12th of September, 1901, in issue No. 209 of  \"El Pueblo,\" a newspaper edited and published in the city of Cebu, and of which the defendant was editor and proprietor, of an article entitled  \"Miracles of Father Julia; the bitter truth,\" in which article are contained libelous phrases tending to dishonor and discredit the complaining witness and to bring him into contempt. In the complaint those parts of the article which are necessary for the purposes of the accusation are copied literally, hence it is not necessary to transcribe them here. <br/><br/>The case having been prosecuted to a termination, the defendant was convicted in the court below and sentenced to four years’ banishment at a distance of 50 kilometers from the town lines of the municipality of Cebu, and to the payment of a fine of 625 pesetas and to the costs of the suit. From this judgment he appeals to this court. <br/><br/>One of the errors assigned by the appellant in this appeal is the infraction of the provisions of section 23 of General Orders, No. 58, which he alleges was committed by the court below in the prosecution of this case against him. This allegation affects the validity of the trial, and is, therefore, by reason of its importance, worthy of a careful consideration. Upon being arraigned on the charge the accused set tip the plea of jeopardy, and asked that the complaint be dismissed. This plea was overruled by the court. Thereupon the application for the allowance of an appeal against the order disposing of the plea of jeopardy having been denied, the plea of jeopardy was again advanced at the time the accused pleaded not guilty. <br/><br/>It is alleged that the prosecuting witness, on the 16th of September, 1901, filed against the defendant a .complaint, amended on the 4th of November following, charging him with the same offense of which he is accused in the present trial — that is, the publication of libelous matter in the issue of the 12th of September, 1901, of the newspaper  \"El Pueblo,\" of which the defendant was editor; that the court sustained a demurrer to this complaint; that in sustaining the demurrer the court did not base its ruling upon a lack of jurisdiction, nor did it order the filing of a new complaint or information. In support of his contention the appellant cites section 23 of General Orders, No. 58, which he alleges prohibits a second trial for the same offense in such cases. <br/><br/>The court below in overruling the said exception of jeopardy did not do so on the ground of the inaccuracy of the facts alleged by the accused as the ground of his motion, but upon the ground that they are not, in his opinion, sufficient to constitute jeopardy, or any other defense. <br/><br/>On his part the complaining witness in a written argument on page 27 of the record admits the truth of the allegations; that a complaint, amended on the 4th of November, 1901, was presented against the accused, and that this complaint was dismissed by the court. He alleges that the ruling is based upon the following grounds:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>(1)\tBecause the said complaint was not drawn in the form required by General Order, No. 58;<br/><br/>(2)\tBecause in the said complaint no allegation was made as to the time or place of the commission of the alleged offense;<br/><br/>(3)\tBecause the alleged libelous words had not been copied therein, but merely the conclusions drawn by the complainant therefrom. <br/><br/>This does not disprove nor is it in conflict with the allegation of the accused that the court below, when dismissing the complaint of November 4, did not order the filing of a new complaint or information, and consequently the truth of this assertion is impliedly admitted. Among the grounds upon which, according to the complaining witness himself, the judge dismissed said complaint, we do not find included a finding that the court was without jurisdiction over the offense charged. The fact that the place in which the offense was committed was not stated in the complaint does not support the deduction which the complainant apparently seeks to draw — that the court dismissed the complaint by reason of lack of jurisdiction — because the only effect produced by such omission is to make the complaint insufficient or defective, but by no means does it deprive the court of the jurisdiction which the law confers upon it, and which it might have exercised bad the complaint been properly drawn. The proof of this is that the complainant subsequently presented the complaint upon which this trial is based, correcting the defects in the complaint of the 4th of November, and presented this new complaint to the same court which had dismissed the preceding one. <br/><br/>Upon the comparison of one complaint with the other, it will readily be seen that the accused is charged therein with the same offense, inasmuch as both refer to the alleged libelous matter published-in the article entitled  \"Miracles of Fattier Julia\" in the issue of  \"El Pueblo,\" of which the defendant was editor, c or responding to the 12th of September, 1901. It is true that in the complaint of November 4 the words contained in the article are not transcribed verbatim, but this circumstance is merely accidental, and by no means necessary for the identification of the offense. It is sufficiently identified by the citation of the article upon which the complaint is based, its heading, the name of the paper in which it was published, the date of its publication, and by the offense which the complainant considers to have been committed by its publication. These are the circumstances which identify the offense with precision and exactness, malting it impossible to confound it with any other; and it appears that in both complaints the same offense is referred to. All this, in connection with the statements alleged in the complaint of the 4th of November to be libelous, all of which are taken from the article referred to and are actually found therein and which, by the way, are the most libelous ones it contained, leaves no ground for the slightest doubt that in the said complaint the accused was charged with the publication against the complainant of the libelous matter contained in the article referred to. This libelous matter is precisely the same as that upon which the complaint in this case is based, and therefore the offense charged in both complaints is one and the same, notwithstanding the fact that the complaint of November 4 was dismissed, because in the opinion of the court below it lacked the elements necessary under the law to the existence of a valid complaint. <br/><br/>The allegation made by the private prosecutor, that the complaint of the 4th of November did not charge the accused with any offense, inasmuch as the judge considered that this allegation was insufficient to charge the offense of libel because it did not contain verbatim the alleged  libelous matter, but only conclusions of the complaining witness himself, is wholly without foundation and can not merit our approval. It is sufficient to read the complaint in order to see that the clergy of libel was clearly and distinctly made, and that the libel was alleged to consist precisely in the article already mentioned. The dismissal of the complaint by reason of its formal defects could not in any degree affect or alter the reality of this fact, whether the conclusions of law of the Court below in its order dismissing it are correct or not, nor can it be at present considered, because of the plaintiff’s admission. Furthermore, the libelous matter, the publication of which is denounced in the complaint, is defamatory in so high a degree that it would be difficult for us to imagine a publication which could possibly be more injurious in the eyes of the public. <br/><br/>We consider, therefore that the record discloses sufficiently —<br/><br/>(1)\tThat the defendant had been accused by the complaining witness in his complaint of November 4, 1901, of the same offense with which he is charged in the present case;<br/><br/>(2)\tThat the said complaint was dismissed by an order sustaining the demurrer of the accused, based, among other grounds, upon the failure to draw the said complaint whitewall the essential requisites prescribed by the law;<br/><br/>(3)\tThat in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint the court did not find that it was without jurisdiction to try the offense charged, nor did it order the presentation of a new complaint or information<br/><br/>This being so, the case falls fully within the provisions of section 23 of G.O., No. 58, which is literally as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"If the demurrer is sustained, the judgment shall be final on the complaint or information demurred to, and it shall be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense, unless the court delivering judgment was without jurisdiction, or unless the court, being of opinion that the objection may be avoided, directs a new complaint or information to be filed. If the court does not direct that the accused be remanded to a court of proper jurisdiction for trial or that a new information be filed, the defendant must be discharged or his bail be exonerated.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The grounds upon which the demurrer referred to in this section may be made are enumerated in section 21, of which section 23 is the complement, and among them is included (No. 2) the objection to the complaint by reason of its failure to conform to the essential requisites prescribed by the law, which was one of the objections advanced by the accused and sustained by the court in dismissing the complaint of November 4, 1901. The court, then, not having declared itself to be without jurisdiction and not having ordered the presentation of a new complaint or information, the order sustaining the plea is a bar to further prosecution of the accused for the same offense charged in the first complaint, in accordance with the provisions of section 23. <br/><br/>The principle established by this section is clear and explicit. If a demurrer by the accused is sustained, in order that he may be prosecuted again for the same offense, it is necessary that the ruling on the demurrer rests upon .the ground of lack of jurisdiction, or the court must have expressly directed the presentation of a new complaint or information. Outside of these two excepted cases, it would be unlawful and unjust to submit the accused to a subsequent prosecution, and to do so would be error. And this is certainly a logical result, in view of the principles of a system of procedure both just and equitable, and neither the spirit nor the law of section 23 are susceptible of any other interpretation. <br/><br/>Without the safeguard this article establishes in favor of the accused, his fortune, safety, and peace of mind would be entirely at the mercy of the complaining witness, who might repeat his accusation as often as dismissed by the court and whenever he might see fit, subject to no other limitation or restriction than his own will and pleasure. The accused would never be free from the cruel and constant menace of a never-ending charge, which the malice of the complaining witness might hold indefinitely suspended over his head, were it not that the judiciary is exclusively empowered to authorize, by an express order to that effect, the repetition of a complaint or information once dismissed in the cases in which the law requires that this be done. Such is, in our opinion, the fundamental reason of the article of the law to which we refer. Thanks to this article, the accused, after being notified of the order dismissing the complaint may, as the case may be, either rest assured that he will not be further molested, or prepare himself for the presentation of a new complaint. In either case, the order gives him full information as to what he may hope or fear, and prevents his reasonable hopes from being dissipated as the result of an equivocal and indefinite legal situation. To this much, at least, one who has been molested, possibly unjustly, by a prosecution on a criminal charge, is entitled. <br/><br/>The objection sustained by the judge in this case solely affected the form of the complaint, and without self-contradiction he might well have ordered the filing of a new complaint or information. Even more, we believe it was his duty to have done so. Our understanding of the spirit of section 23 is that it makes it the duty of the judge to enter such an order whenever he considers that the defect may be cured — i. e., whenever the nature of the defect is such as not to be incompatible with the filing of a new complaint or information. The judge not having done this, the private prosecutor should have appealed if he desired to preserve his right to file a new complaint for the same offense. Far from doing so, he consented to the order by which the demurrer was sustained, without reservation or restriction of any kind, and he must suffer the legal consequence of his own negligence. <br/><br/>The accused calls the defense or exception of which he avails himself under section 23, jeopardy. We are of the opinion that this is a misnomer. Jeopardy can only result after arraignment upon a complaint sufficient both in farm and substance. (Section 28). In the present case the complaint of November 4 was dismissed precisely because it lacked the essential requisites necessary to its validity and sufficient as a matter of law. For the very reason that the complaint was dismissed upon the demurrer of the accused there was no arraignments as this would only have taken place had the demurrer been overruled (section 24) . It is therefore evident that this is not a case of jeopardy, notwithstanding the exception or defense set up by the accused is complete and is sufficient to offset the accusation brought by the complaining witness in this case. Section 23 establishes a special defense which, without constituting jeopardy, produces, nevertheless, the same effect as a matter of law, inasmuch as it is a bar to further prosecution for the same offense. But the judge violated the legal principle contained in tilts section, and therefore committed an error of law in overruling the plea and in directing the continuance of the prosecution of the cause against the accused. <br/><br/>For these reasons we set aside the judgment of the court below, together with all the proceedings in the trial, with the costs of both instances de oficio. So ordered. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Cooper, Willard and Ladd, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/>Torres and McDonough, <em>JJ.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",

      "justify_content info is '<div align=\"justify\">The defendant has been convicted in the trial court of publishing a libel upon J. H. Goldman. The supposed libel is contained in a writing in the form of a petition, signed by the defendant and addressed to the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Pilar, Bataan. This writing was sent by the defendant, inclosed in a sealed envelope, to the justice of the peace. Several criminal prosecutions were at this time pending against the defendant before the justice, and When the petition was delivered the preliminary investigation was being held in one of these cases. The petition states that it is rumored that a plan has been formed to prosecute the petitioner for the purpose of discrediting his candidacy for the governorship of the province, and in general to injure his reputation. Then follows this language, the italicized words being those which are alleged to constitute the libel:  \"The hatred and animosity, Mr. Justice, of certain provincial officials toward me, and especially of the governor, Mr. Goldman, the defeated candidate in the recent elections, and of the provincial fiscal, Señor Soriano, who has been and is my open enemy are notorious not only in this province but in Manila, the evident purpose, the outgrowth of previous resentment, being to ruin my political career. The accusations which have been fabricated against me are premeditated and false, the result of passions engendered by political contests, and for this reason the worthy authorities at Manila, in the exercise of their sound judgment, rejected them when they were presented to them. The governor, Mr. Goldman, availing himself of the office which he holds as a provincial authority, has extorted affidavits from certain persons who he has caused to sign incorrect documents.\" The petition goes on to suggest that the fiscal ought to withdraw from the prosecutions, being attorney for the parties claiming to be aggrieved, and, after exhorting the justice to act with the deliberation which the gravity of the situation demands, concludes with a prayer that, before any judgment unfavorable to the petitioner is rendered, he be given an opportunity to be heard and to testify in his own behalf, and that the petition be filed in the cause, if there is one pending. <br/><br/>While it was not, perhaps, shown at the trial that Mr. Goldman had been instrumental in securing any statements which were ever actually laid before the justice of the peace, it did appear that he had been instrumental in securing statements charging the defendant with various acts of wrongdoing, some of which acts were the subject of certain of the prosecutions pending before the justice at the time of the filing of the petition. Whether the evidence shows that these statements, or any of them, had been secured by Mr. Goldman in such a manner as to warrant the charge that they were  \"extorted\" from the parties who made them, and whether the statements were true or not, are questions which we do not think it necessary to determine. There was some evidence tending to establish the affirmation of both these propositions. <br/><br/>Assuming that the statements in the petition relating to Mr. Goldman are defamatory, were they made under such circumstances and for cycle a purpose as to relieve the defendant from criminal responsibility for them?<br/><br/>Section 3 of Act No. 277 provides that  \"an injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\" The effect of this provision is to make the existence of justifiable motives a complete defense to a prosecution for libel. If the publication is shown to have been made with justifiable motives the malicious intent, which is an essential ingredient in the definition of the offense (secs. 1 and 2), and which is presumed from the mere fact of the publication of defamatory matter, is negatived. In other words, the existence of justifiable motives implies the absence of malice. Whether the defendant can, by merely showing that the supposed libel was published upon what is known in the common law as a  \"privileged occasion,\" shift to the government the burden of going forward with evidence to show actual malice, need not now be considered. When the evidence is all in, if the defendant has shown the existence of justifiable motives, he is entitled to an acquittal; otherwise the publication is considered malicious and he must be convicted. <br/><br/>It has been suggested that section l is inconsistent with section 3, giving to the latter section the construction which we have placed upon it. It may be difficult to harmonize these sections if the language of section 4 is to be taken in its literal significance, but we think there is no inconsistency if we look to the real purpose of the two sections. <br/><br/>Section 4 is as follows:  \"In all criminal prosecutions for libel the truth may be given in evidence to the court, and if it appears to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The effect of this section appears to be to make the fact that the defamatory matter was true, evidence to show the existence of justifiable motives, but as justifiable motives may be lacking even where the defamatory matter is true — the common-law maxim indeed being that the greater the truth the greater the libel — the law says that it is not enough merely to establish the truth of the words alleged to be libelous, but that the court must be satisfied upon the whole case, giving to the fact that the words are true such importance as it may deserve as the basis of an inference as to the true character of the party’s conduct, that the motif es of the publication were good and the ends justifiable. <br/><br/>If the purpose of the section is to make it in general incumbent upon the defendant, in order to establish a defense to a prosecution for libel, to prove both truth and justifiable motives, the words  \"the truth may be given in evidence to the court\" are superfluous; so also is the clause  \"but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.\" The whole structure of the section indicates that it is not intended as a qualification of the general rule of responsibility laid down in section 3, but that its purpose is, as we have said, merely to render admissible evidence of truth in order to show the character of the defendant’s motives. <br/><br/>We take it that the words  \"good motives\" and  \"justifiable ends\" of section 4 are of equivalent import with the expression  \"justifiable motive\" in section 3. <br/><br/>Act No. 277, down to section 11, is almost identical with sections 248-257 of the California Penal Code. The California statute is itself framed on the lines of other recent English and American legislation, by which the common law doctrine whereby a defendant was not permitted in a criminal prosecution for libel to prove that his words were true, has been modified to the extent of permitting such evidence  \"when the further fact appears that the publication was made with good motives and for justifiable ends\" (2 Bishop’s New Criminal Law, sec. 920); or  \"that it was for the public benefit\" that the words should have been published. (4 Enc. of Laws of England, 189.) <br/><br/>Section 9 of Act No. 277 provides that  \"a private communication made by any person to another, in good faith, in the performance of any duty, whether legal, moral, or social, solely with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting the interests of the person making the communication or the interests of the person to whom the communication is made, is a privileged communication, and the person making the same shall not be guilty of libel nor be within the provisions of this act.\" What constitutes a justifiable motive is thus defined with reference to private communications, and it is to be noticed that it is not necessary, in order to establish tea defense in such cases, that the truth of the words should be proved. If the construction which we have placed upon section 3 is not correct, but it is necessary with reference to written statements not embraced within section 9 to show battle justifiable motives and the truth of the statements, in order to establish a defense, then it follows that private written communications are placed upon a more favorable footing than written statements made by a judge, counsel, witness, or, as in the present case, by a party, in the course of judicial proceedings, and, in general, more favorable than any written statements made in the discharge of public duties of any character. We do not think this result could have been contemplated by the framers of the act. <br/><br/>If the effect of section 3 is, as laws been suggested, merely to fix the burden of proof and not to make the existence of justifiable motives a defense, it will still be necessary in every case, in order to decide whether the presumption of malice is rebutted, to determine what are to be considered justifiable motives. The difficulty which it is supposed could result from the construction of section 3, which we have adopted, that there would be  \"absolutely no guide or compass to direct the court in the determination of what are justifiable motives,\" exists, therefore, if it exists at all, equally upon the other construction. <br/><br/>The ultimate question is, then, as we construe Act No. 277 whether the words alleged to constitute the libel were published with justifiable motives. <br/><br/>The matter contained in the petition presented to the justice by the defendant all related to the supposed prosecutions against the latter, and we think the circumstances of the case show quite conclusively that the sole motive of the defendant in presenting, the petition was to defend himself against those charges. It was not an attempt to make use of judicial proceedings as a vehicle for the utterance of slander. It was merely an exercise of the natural right which a person accused of crime possesses, and which it is for the public interest that he should enjoy unhampered so long as he exercises it in good faith and in a proper manner, to bring to the notice of the tribunal which is to pass upon his guilt all such considerations as he thinks may influence its judgment in his behalf, even though he may in so doing  \"incidentally disparage private character.\" In the sense of the law we think, therefore, that the defendant s motives must be regarded as justifiable. <br/><br/>We do not undertake to lay down any general rule as to what is to be regarded as a justifiable motive\" in criminal prosecutions for libel under Act No. 277. Other cases, involving different conditions of fact, will be determined as they arise. The publication in the present case must, we think, be regarded as having been made with justifiable motives upon any rational view which can be taken of the meaning of that expression. This result seems a mere corollary from principles of natural right as well as of public policy too obvious to require any express recognition in the written law, and though in accord with the American and English doctrine as to the privilege accorded parties, witnesses, and counsel in judicial proceedings, has been reached independently of that doctrine. <br/><br/>The judgment is reversed, with costs de oficio. Let the case be returned to the court below for proceedings in conformity with this opinion, acquitting the defendant. <br/><br/>Arellano, <em>C.J.</em>, Torres and Mapa, <em>JJ.</em>, concur. <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong>Separate Opinions</strong></div><br/><br/>WILLARD, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>By sections 1 and 2 of Act No. 277 no one can be punished for publishing a libel unless it appears that the publication was malicious. Section 3 is as follows:  \"An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The purpose of this section, in my opinion, was to do away the necessity of proving malice in certain cases. Its purpose was simply to place the burden of proof. According to the opinion of the court, however, it has a much broader meaning. It is an independent and substantive provision which treats not of presumptions but of defenses, and declares that it shall be a complete defense if the defendant shows that the publication was made with justifiable motives. According to this opinion, it is not necessary to look into other parts of the law in order to find what motives are justifiable. The court can judge for itself in each case whether, in its opinion, the defendant, under all the circumstances of that case, was justified in publishing the libel. There is absolutely no guide or compass to direct the court in this determination. It is at perfect liberty to decide each case, without reference to any rules whatever which declare what are or what are not justifiable motives. Should a court below decide that there were justifiable motives. how is the Supreme Court to determine, as a matter of law, that the judge below was wrong, if there is no rule  to which his decision is to be referred in order to know whether it was right or wrong? How is a party to know whether he has a right to publish a certain article? He knows that if he publishes it with justifiable motives he can not be punished. But where is he going to learn in advance what motives are justifiable? There would be absolutely nothing to which he could resort to obtain this information. He could not take the opinion to the judges in advance, and that opinion, with nothing to guide it, would determine his guilt or innocence, it is true that in the progress of time a body of decisions would grow up which might furnish him some light, if the doctrine of stare decisis should be adhered to. But in the meantime he would without relief. <br/><br/>It seems to me that this construction makes unnecessary all of the law after section 3. Having defined a libel, the law says that the accused shall be punished for it if the judges of the Supreme Court see fit to do so. But such absolute discretion has not, as far as I know, been given to the judges by any other body of laws. The Spanish law to the judges by any other body of laws. The Spanish law required a conviction on proof of publication in  cases of calumnia, unless the defendant proved the truth of the charge; and in cases of injuria it required a conviction regardless of the truth of the charge, except in cases of public servants. <br/><br/>The American and English authorities define now with much precision the cases in which communications are privileged, either absolutely or prima facie. They leave nothing to the discretion of the court. <br/><br/>In order to determine what are justifiable motives, we must look into other parts of the law itself for a definition of this term. This section does not create a substantive defense independent of other provisions of the act. <br/><br/>The inconsistency between section 3, as construed by the court, and section 4 is, I think, apparent. A person prosecuted for libel, let us suppose, undertakes to prove the truth of the article, and also that he published it with good motives and for justifiable ends. He does not prove that the article is true, but he does prove that he published it with good motives and for justifiable ends. If section 3 is to be applied to his case he must be acquitted. If section 4 is to be applied he must be convicted. <br/><br/>The error in the construction placed upon section 3 by the court appears also from section 9. This section undoubtedly declares that a private communication, if published under certain circumstances, is made with justifiable motives. If section 3 gives the court a power to declare what are justifiable motives, unlimited by other provisions of the act, it could declare in one case that the motives set out in section did not justify the publication, and in another case that facts which failed entirely to bring the case within section 9 would, notwithstanding, constitute justifiable motives and entitle the defendant to an acquittal. <br/><br/>The difficulty which the court has encountered in this case arises in this way. The act has declared that certain publications are privileged. By section 9 a private communication, made in the performance of some duty, is privileged. By section 7 a newspaper is authorized to publish, if it does so without malice or comment, reports of judicial proceedings. But the act has not expressly declared that a libelous document presented in a judicial proceeding is privileged. The case at bar is such a case It is not covered, in my opinion, by section 7. There is a marked difference between the publication by a newspaper, without malice or comment of a document which is actually a part of the records of the court, and the presentation to the court of such a document. In the latter case, the question as to whether the document was or was not material to the case would be a proper subject of inquiry while in the former case it could not be required of a newspaper that, before publishing an official record, it consult a lawyer for the purpose of determining whether or not the record which it proposes to publish was material to the controversy then before the court. To publish a record of the court is one thing; to make that record is an altogether different thing. <br/><br/>The case not being covered by section 7, it seems plain that it is not included in section 9. There are no other provisions of the act applicable, and the result is that there has been a failure to provide in this law for what are known in some of the American text-books as absolutely privileged communications. <br/><br/>Can we resort to any other body of law to supply this defect? That we can not resort to the common law of England or America seems clear. That body of law has never been in force in these Islands. While, for the purpose of construing acts placed in force here by the Commission, we may resort to the construction placed upon similar laws existing in the United States, yet we can not supply actual omissions in such acts by adding to them provisions on the same subject which may exist in the American laws. The difficulty of so doing is illustrated by this case. In some of the States of the Union utterances in court are absolutely privileged, whether material or not. In others they are not, unless they have some connection with the matter in litigation. Are we to supply the defect in our law by taking from the former States or from the latter?<br/><br/>The body of penal law in force in these Islands at the time Act No. 277 was passed was the Penal Code. This act was simply an amendment of that Code. It repealed only such parts of that Code as were in conflict with it. Article 467 is in part as follows:  \"No one can maintain an action for libel or slander committed in judicial proceedings without first obtaining permission therefor from the trial court. This was the law in force in regard to libelous statements made in court when Act No. 277 was passed. That act says nothing about this subject. This provision of the Code is not inconsistent with anything in the act. It is, I think, still in force, and is applicable to this case. <br/><br/>I concur in the .judgment, on the ground that this prosecution was commenced without the previous permission of the court to which the libelous document was presented. <br/><br/>COOPER, <em>J.</em>, concurring:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">chanrob1es virtual 1aw library</span><br/><br/>The statement upon which the charge of libel is based was contained in a letter signed by the defendant and addressed to the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Pilar, Bataan. <br/><br/>Assuming that the statement upon which the prosecution is based is libelous in its nature, still the defendant can not be convicted under the provisions of the Libel Act, inasmuch as the statement was contained in a private communication and is a privileged writing within the provisions of section 9 of the act, which reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Sec. 9. A private communication made by any person to another, in good faith, in the performance of any duty, whether legal, moral, or social, solely with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting the interests of the person making the communication or the interests of the person to whom the communication is made, is a privileged communication, and the person making the same shall not be guilty of libel nor be within the provisions of this act.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>That the document was a private communication clearly appears from the testimony. The statement was contained in a letter signed by the defendant, inclosed in a sealed envelope and addressed to the justice of the peace. That the communication was made in good faith and solely with the fair and reasonable purpose of protecting the interests of the writer appears equally plain. It was done for the purpose of exculpating himself before the justice of the peace then about to enter upon the trial of certain criminal cases that were pending against the defendant. There is nothing, to show that he could possibly have had in view any other purpose. As said in the majority opinion, it was not an attempt to make use of it as a vehicle for the utterance of slander. This is sufficient to bring the case within the provisions of section 9, without the necessity of making proof of the truth of the matter, or proof of other justifiable motives. Such other proof is not required by the provisions of this section to constitute the defense. <br/><br/>I do not concur in the construction placed upon section 3 of the Libel Act as, given in the majority opinion, and upon which the decision of the court rests. The execution reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"Sec. 3. An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The majority opinion of the court states that the effect of this provision is  \"to make the existence of justifiable motive a complete defense for a prosecution for libel.\" Such a construction is in conflict with the express provisions of section 4 of the act, and has the effect of repealing it. This section reads as follows:<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">jgc:chanrobles.com.ph</span><br/><br/>\"SEC. 4. In all criminal prosecutions for libel the truth may be given in evidence to the court, and if it appeals to the court that the matter charged as libelous is true and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted; otherwise he shall be convicted; but to establish this defense, not only must the truth of the matter so charged be proven but also that it was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.\"<span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 1pt;\">cralaw virtua1aw library</span><br/><br/>The proper construction of section 3 is, that it is intended simply to operate as a rule of evidence, establishing a presumption of malice from the fact of an injurious publication. It is not intended to confer a substantive defense. The provision of section 1, on the other hand, is not made for the purpose of regulating the evidence, but is intended to establish a defense. At the common law, the truth of the matter charged to be libelous was not of itself a defense to a criminal action for libel, nor was it under the civil law. By article 460 of the Spanish Penal Code it is expressly provided that persons charged with libel shall not be allowed to furnish evidence tending to prove the truth of the imputations. The purpose of section 4 was to change the law in this particular. <br/><br/>It does not appear from the evidence that the written communication to the justice of the peace was ever filed in the case, or was intended as other than a private communication. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the state of the present libel law with reference to judicial proceedings. The protection in such cases will likely be found to rest upon the public policy, to promote justice, by removing the restraint imposed by fear of civil or criminal responsibility, exempting from liability for torts or criminal prosecutions all persons connected as essential parties in a judicial proceeding, such as the officers of the court, the parties to the suit, and the witnesses who testify. (I Jaggard on Torts, 127.) <br/><br/>My concurrence in the decision of the case is based upon the reasons above stated. <br/><br/>McDonough, <em>J.</em>, did not sit in this case. </div>'\n",
