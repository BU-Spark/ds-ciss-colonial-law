      "WILLARD, J. : chanrob1es virtual 1aw library 1. Of the fourteen assignments of error made by the counsel for the defendants, the first four relate to the complaint. Though it is said that the complaint is unintelligible and ambiguous, the defendant’s counsel nowhere states in what respect it is ambiguous. We see no such defects and hold the complaint sufficient. 2. That the complaint is not drawn in conformity with section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not important. That section refers to civil actions. 3. That Severina Lomboy, an eyewitness of the robbery, did not testify is no ground for a new trial. General Orders, No. 58, section 15, gives to the defendants compulsory process for obtaining witnesses. If they wished the testimony of this witness, they should have called her themselves. It does not been dead or absent. In order that the presumption mentioned in section 334, paragraph 5, of the Code of Civil Procedure may be operative, it must appear that the testimony was willfully suppressed. That does not appear in this case. 4. Assignments of error 7, 10 and 11 relate to the sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. We are of the opinion that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction. 5. We have frequently said that the proceedings before the justice of the peace in the preliminary hearing are not a part of the record of the trial Court of First Instance simply because they are found among the papers sent to this court. If the defendants claimed that the witnesses testified differently in the Court of First Instance from what they did before the justice of the peace, they should have proved in the Court of First Instance what was the testimony of the witnesses before the justice. So, if it is claimed that any proceedings before the justice were irregular, proof of this irregularity should have been made before the Court of First Instance, so as to have properly incorporated in the record of the case in that court the proceedings before the justice. Nothing of this kind was done in this case. This dipsoses of the assignments of error 8, 9, 12 and 13. The judgment of the court below imposed a fine of 25 pesos upon the defendants. As the law does not authorize a fine in this class of crimes, we assumed that it was intended as indemnity to the party injured and we so make it. With this modification the judgment below is affirmed with cost of this instance against the defendants. Arellano, C.J. , Cooper, Mapa and Ladd, JJ. , concur. Torres and McDonough, JJ. , did not sit in this case.\n",

      "WILLARD, J. : chanrob1es virtual 1aw library 1. The applicants first assignment of error is that the court below erred in refusing to receive as evidence certain documents certified by the president of the municipality of Balasan, it being claimed by the appellant that, as official documents, they should have been admitted. These documents certify that certain persons appeared before the president, at the request of the appellant, and made the statements contained in the documents. These statements were declarations as to what the persons making them knew concerning the matters in controversy in this action. Section 381 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:  \"The testimony of all witnesses, except such as has been taken in writing in the form of depositions as otherwise provided by law, shall be given on oath in open court orally, and each witness may be orally cross-examined by the adverse party.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The testimony contained in these documents was not taken in the manner provided for taking depositions in sections 353-376 of said Code. Neither were said documents official or public writings as that phrase is defined in section 299 of the same Code. Neither by the Municipal Code nor by any other law has a president of a municipality now any authority to receive declarations and make a record of them in the manner followed in this case. The documents were properly rejected by the court. 2. The appellant accepts the established doctrine of this court that the decision of the court below, with the admissions in the pleadings, must contain facts sufficient as a matter of law to support the judgment. (Thunga Chui v. Que Bentec, 1 Off. Gaz., September 10, 1902; 1 Martinez v. Martinez, 1 Off. Gaz., 268; 2 Balatbat v. Tanjutco, 1 Off. Gaz., 405. 3) As his other assignment of error he claims that under this doctrine the decision should have stated facts showing that the two other defendants, in whose favor judgment was rendered, were not liable to the plaintiff, the release of his codefendants being prejudicial to the Appellant . When a judgment is rendered for the defendant, a simple finding, express or implied, that the complaint is not true, is sufficient. The court finds that the appellant cut and ground the cane. This is a finding that he alone appropriated it to his own use, and necessarily excludes the idea that the other defendants participated in the appropriation. It was a sufficient finding on which to base a judgment in their favor. But it is claimed that the court found, also, that the appellant did these acts under the direction of his codefendants and divided the property with them. This claim is not supported by the record. The decision states not that this was a fact, but that the appellant alleged it to be a fact. The judgment is affirmed, with costs of this instance against the Appellant . Arellano, C.J. , Torres, Mapa and McDonough, JJ. , concur. Separate Opinions COOPER, J. , concurring: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I concur in the decision affirming the judgment, but the statement contained in the judgment of the lower court that the defendants  \"cut and ground the cane,\" is not, in my opinion, a sufficient finding of fact to support the judgment, and in this I disagree with the majority opinion. This statement appears to be but an accidental recital of evidence. The findings of fact must be of all the material facts at issue. The issues presented by the pleadings in this case were the ownership of the property by the plaintiff, and the wrongful conversion of it by the defendants. These issues would not be included in the statement that  \"the cane was cut and ground by the defendants.\" This is but a probative or evidential fact. It would tend to prove the issue but would be insufficient as an ultimate finding of fact in that it does not appear that the taking of the cane was wrongful, which is one of the material issues in the case. I think the judgment is rather to be supported by the presumption which is indulged in favor of judgments of trial courts. Where no findings are made, the presumption is that all the facts were found in favor of the party for whom the judgment was rendered, otherwise the court would not have rendered such judgments; and where no express findings are made, and the evidence is omitted from the record, such findings will be presumed as are necessary to support the judgment. (2 Enc. of Pleading and Practice, 489, citing Clark v. Willett, 35 Cal., 534.) It is quite plain from a perusal of the judgment that there was no attempt to make a finding of facts. The right of a party to have the court make separate conclusions of fact and of law, in accordance with section 133 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is a substantial right, and a judgment should be reversed for a refusal to grant such right; but where the record contains no findings, it will be presumed that they were waived, if nothing appears to the contrary. An objection based upon a mere omission to make a finding of fact can not be raised for the first time on appeal. If the party who complains desired such finding of fact he should have requested the court to make it, and if such request was refused he should have excepted to the ruling of the court. When a finding is made by the lower court and it does not cover all the material issues, it must be excepted to for that reason, and the exception should particularly specify the defect and point out the issue upon which the finding is desired. (8 Enc. of Pleading and Practice, 276.) In this case there was no objection made to the judgment in the court below, except such as may be inferred from the simple fact of the notice of appeal and the perfecting of the bill of exceptions. The general rule is that exceptions which were not taken upon the trial, or in the course of the proceedings below, can not be urged upon appeal. It is but reasonable to require a party desiring to review a case in the appellate court to call the attention of the trial court to the proceedings complained of. The attention of the court below should be directed to the defects or omissions which have thus occurred, in order that the court may have an opportunity to correct such defects or omissions. This rule is necessary to the due administration of justice. To permit a party to remain silent at a time when the defect could be easily remedied, until it is too late to make the correction, is unjust both to the trial court and to the adverse party. In this case, if the objection have been made in the lower court that the finding was insufficient to support the judgment, the correction could easily have been made. It would be unjust to permit the objection to be raised for the first time in this court, and to reverse the judgment for this reason. Endnotes: 1. 1 Phil. Rep., 356. 2. 1 Phil. Rep., 647. 3.

      "WILLARD, J p. : chanrob1es virtual 1aw library We find it necessary to pass upon only one of the questions presented by the record. The appellant makes the following statement in his brief, in this court: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"There is no doubt that the defendant has the character of a receiver, consequently it is his duty to return what he has received in trust. This being the case, the punishable act involved in a refusal to so return implies a damage to the depositor or his assignee, inasmuch as the latter is illegally deprived of something which belongs to him; and this refusal and damage is covered by the fifth clause of article 535 of the Penal Code.\" cralaw virtua1aw library This is not the law. The paragraph cited from the Penal Code says that the depositary shall be guilty of estafa, not if he refuses to return the thing deposited but if he denies that he ever received it. In this case the defendant has never denied that he received the rice as a deposit; on the contrary, when the demand was made upon him by the private prosecutor On December 7, 1901, he said that he had delivered it to Alejandro Cornejo a few days before the death of Borras, the bailor, by the written order of the latter. The defendant never having denied that he received the deposit, he can not be convicted unless it is proved that he has appropriated or diverted it. The mere refusal to return the article is not in itself sufficient to prove this. In addition to this refusal, there must be evidence in the case from which the court can see that the depositary has appropriated it to his own use or to that of another. There is no such evidence. On the contrary, it is entirely probable that, after the departure of the defendant from Libmanan on September 20,1898, two days after the uprising of the civil guard in Nueva Caceres, the rice was seized by the revolutionists and appropriated to their own uses. The brief of the appellant is devoted almost exclusively to establishing the civil liability of the defendant. With such liability we have nothing to do in this case. Whatever may be the fact in regard thereto, it is plain that no criminal liability has been proved. The judgment is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the private prosecutor, the Appellant . Arellano, C.J. , Torres, Cooper, Mapa and McDonough, JJ. , concur. Johnson, J. , did not sit in this case.\n",

Both were convicted, and Ravidas was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years and Melliza to three years. Both appealed to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the conviction. After the case was lodged in the Supreme Court the attorneys for the two defendants named made a motion that they be allowed bail pending appeal, no such motion having been made in the trial court. This motion was heard on November 16, 1903, and was opposed by the representative of the Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the Government. On November 30, 1903, the court directed the entry of the following order on its minutes: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Acting upon the motion of Messrs. Palma, Gerona, & Mercado, Attorneys for Alejo Ravidas and Narciso Melliza, defendants in the case of the United States vs Ravidas Et. Al., that the said defendants be granted bail during the pendency of the appeal in this case before the court, after deliberation: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Resolved, by a majority vote, That the motion to admit the said defendants to bail be denied. The Hon. C. S. Arellano, Chief Justice, and Justices Torres, Willard, and Johnson voted to deny the motion.\" cralaw virtua1aw library From the order so entered and the refusal to grant bail Justices McDonough, Mapa, and Cooper dissented. Separate Opinions McDONOUGH, J. , with whom concur COOPER and MAPA, JJ. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library This is a motion to admit the defendants to bail pending the trial of their appeal in this court. Bail is usually favored. Before conviction, except in capital cases, it is allowed as a matter of right. After conviction, however, it is discretionary with the Court of First Instance and also with this court to grant or refuse bail in noncapital cases pending on appeal. (See sec. 53, G. O., 58.) In several of the States the courts have refused to exercised this discretions unless there exist special circumstances which call for the intervention of the court in behalf of the prisoner. In those States the question has often been raised as to what is a special circumstance which justifies the courts in letting to bail after conviction and pending an appeal. The answers have been numerous, various, and many of them vague. 1. In California it was said in the case of Ex parte Smallman Et. Al. (54 Cal., 35), that it might be a special circumstance warranting the granting of bail when, for example, after a conviction for the crime of felonious homicide and appeal  \"the deceased\" was produced alive. 2. The same court gave as another instance: Where the defendant had been convicted of stealing goods and it turned out afterwards that the goods of which he was convicted of stealing were at the time of the alleged theft in the hands of the owner. With all due respect to the learned judge who gave these instances, it may be remarked that these were special circumstances warranting speedy pardon rather than bail. 3. It was held in Nebraska (42 Neb., 48) that, after conviction and pending appeal, this discretion of the court may be exercised upon the showing of probable error calling for a reversal of the judgment. New York State follows this view and, pending appeal and an application for a stay and for bail, the court will look into the record for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not there is probable cause for reversal. In Indiana it has been held, on an appeal from the refusal of a judge to admit to bail, the supreme court will weigh the evidence and determine the facts, as if trying the case originally. (Ex parte Heffernan, 27 Ind., 87; Ex parte Kendall, 100 Ind., 599, and cases cited.) 4. In 3 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 667, it is said that a special circumstance justifying bail, after conviction, is where the defendant voluntarily surrendered; or 5. Where he is a man of large means; or 6. Where he refused an opportunity to escape; or 7. When the defendant is seriously ill; or 8. When the hearing on the appeal has been unnecessary delayed. Thus it appears that the exceptions are so numerous that they almost constitute the rule. The discretion to let to bail conferred on this court is to be exercised regardless of the action of the Court of First Instance. Even in California, where it frequently happened that the trial court refused to exercise the discretion vested in it to let to bail, the supreme court, in the case of Smith (89 Cal., 80), rebuked th court below for failure to act.  \"The fact,\" said the learned judge of the supreme court who wrote the opinion,  \"that the trial court adopted an inflexible rule not to admit a defendant to bail who has been convicted of a felony, can have no weight with us, however inconsistent such rule is with section 1272 of the Penal Code\" (allowing the court to exercise discretion).  \"This court passes upon the merits of the petition presented to it regardless of any action or rule the trial court may have adopted.\" cralaw virtua1aw library In the case of Hodge (48 Cal., 3) the chief justice of the supreme court allowed bail after it have been refused by the court below. There the defendant had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to do bodily injury. The punishment for that offense was a fine or imprisonment, and the defendant had been sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of eighteen months in the State prison. On the argument, the attention of Chief Justice Wallace was called to the record, and he evidently examined the record and the rulings of the court below and the charge to the jury, for he said: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"It is not proper that I should intimate an opinion as to the ultimate determination of the points which it is the purpose of this appeal to present for the judgment of the supreme court. \"They are sufficient in my judgment to show that the appeal is bona fide and that the case made is not to be characterized as frivolous or unsubstantial. \"I think that should I, under the circumstance, refuse to admit the prisoner to bail, it would be a misapplication of the discretion conferred by the statute. \"The right to appeal to the supreme court is guaranteed by the Constitution to the prisoner and is as secure as the right of trial by jury. It is one of the means the law has provided to determine the question of his guilt or innocence. Upon such an appeal the ultimate question is nearly always as to the validity of the judgment under which the prisoner is to suffer, and it is certainly not consonant to our ideas of justice, if it can be prevented by legal means, that, even while the question of guilt or innocence is yet being agitated in the form of an appeal, the prisoner should be undergoing the very punishment and suffering the very infamy which it was the lawful purpose of the appeal to avert. It would be somewhat skin to a practice of punishing the accused for his alleged offense while the jury was yet deliberating upon a verdict.\" cralaw virtua1aw library These are sensible and weighty reasons for the exercise of the discretion of the court to let a prisoner out on bail pending his appeal, but weighty and just as they may be in California, there is much more reason for following them in these Islands, because here the accused is not finally tried until his case is heard, retried, and determined by this court, which, in case of conviction, sentences the accused for the full term prescribed by law; and he is obliged to serve the full term of imprisonment imposed upon him by this court, without being credited with the time served in prison, between the time of determining his guilt below and the time of conviction here, except where convicted of certain minor offenses in which the convict is credited with half the time served pending the appeal. So that this may result, especially if delay occurs in bringing the case to trial in this court, and in deciding the same, that an accused may have to serve a longer term in prison than is prescribed by the Code. Moreover, in the State courts, the accused is allowed bail as matter of right before conviction by a jury in noncapital cases. The conviction, under our system, in a Court of First Instance, where an appeal has been taken, is very like an examination and a holiday for trial by a committing magistrate in the States, if the holding of this court in the case of the United States v. Kepner (1 Off. Gaz., 353) be good law. 1 In the opinion of this court in that case, it is stated, under the Spanish rule in these Islands:  \"There never was any finality to the judgment of the trial court, in felony cases, after it has been ratified and confirmed by the court of last resort. Such a judgment was merely advisory to the appellate tribunal . . . That was the law of the land when the change of sovereignty took place, and it has only been modified since to the extent of making the judgment of the Court of First Instance, in a felony cases (except capital offenses) final, unless an appeal has been taken either by the Attorney-General or the accused. So then, so now.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Inasmuch as there has been an appeal taken in the case at bar, the judgment below, therefore, is not final; it is not such a judgment as is entered in the States upon the verdict of a jury; it is in its nature  \"merely advisory,\" and, therefore, it, together with the double punishment mentioned above, constitutes a special circumstance entitling the defendants to the exercise of the discretion of the court in their favor. It seems to me that this court ought to follow the practice of the Federal courts and that of the Supreme Court of the United States, and not deny bail after conviction unless some special circumstance exists which appeals especially to the discretion of the court, but rather to allow bail, unless some great urgency exists which would make it manifestly improper to grant the petition. Thus in the case of McKnight (113 Fed. Rep., 451), decided by the circuit court of appeals of the sixth circuit, 1902, it was held that the United States Court of Appeals, pending a writ of error, had power, and that it was generally its duty to admit the bail, after conviction of a crime not capital; that where the trial court refused to admit to bail pending a writ of error, in the absence of some great urgency, a further application should be made to the appellate court, and that the fact that the defendant had been three times convicted on the same indictment, for embezzling funds of national bank, was not sufficient ground for denying bail pending a writ of error. In the case of Hudson v. Parker (156 U. S., 227) it appeared that Hudson had been convicted in the United States district court for the western district of Arkansas, of assault with intent to kill, and was sentenced for imprisonment for a term of years. A writ of error was granted by one of the justices of the supreme court (not assigned to that circuit) and an order made for supersedeas and bill, in a sum named, pending the writ, the bond to be approved by Judge Parker, the district judge. He, however, refused to approve the bond, holding that the supreme court judge was without authority to let the prisoner to bail. In the opinion of the supreme court it was said that:  \"The statues of the United States have been framed upon the theory that a person accused of a crime shall not, until he is finally adjudged guilty in the court of last resort, be absolutely compelled to undergo imprisonment or punishment, but may be admitted to bail not only after arrest and before trial, but after conviction and pending a writ of error,\" and so the court ordered a mandamus to be issued commanding Judge Parker to take action regarding the approval of the bond. For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the defendants should be let to bail pending the disposal of their appeal in this court. Endnotes: 1. 1 Phil. Rep., 397.\n",

John C: Sweeney, judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, commanding that, after the bond heretofore offered shall have been filed, he, as judge of Part III of said court, shall remit to this court the cause referred to on appeal, in order that the court may pass upon petitioner’s right to appeal, the bond required by law having been duly filed, and that this court may render final judgment in the matter of the appointment of a guardian for Don Francisco Martinez.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Mandamus has always been regarded as an extraordinary legal remedy granted by courts of appellate jurisdiction directed to some corporation, officer, or inferior court, requiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty results from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed or from operation of some law. It has never been the practice of any court under any sovereignty to grant this extraordinary writ of mandamus if  \"there is another plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It is now the practice in this court, when an application is made for the writ of mandamus, for the clerk of the court to issue an order to show cause, directed to the respondent, without submitting the application therefor to the court or any member thereof in the first instance. In other words, an applicant may file his petition asking for the writ of mandamus with the clerk of the court, and the clerk thereupon may issue an order to show cause why the writ of mandamus should not issue, direct the same to the respondent, and compel him to incur all of the annoyance and loss of time in preparing a demurrer or an answer why the writ of mandamus should not be issued, without having the application therefor passed upon by the court or by some member thereof. This practice, in our judgment, is wrong. The writ of mandamus is not a writ to which a party has an absolute right. In our judgment it is not intended by statutes in force in these Islands to give it this character. It is an extraordinary remedy, and should be granted only in extraordinary cases, and then only when the parties are without other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law. A writ of right is a writ to which the parties are entitled upon filing a petition in proper form, which then issues as a matter of course upon the mere application (oral or written) therefor. An ordinary summons is a writ of right. In other words, by filing the petition in an ordinary civil action in the Courts of First Instance of these Islands, the party filing the same is entitled to a summons directing the other party to appear and demur or answer within a definite period. Any person filing the ordinary petition is entitled to this writ as of right. But the extraordinary writ of mandamus is a very different procedure. It is extraordinary in its nature, and unless the law specifically provides that the clerk may issue a notice to show cause why it should not issue, the clerk ought not to be vested with such authority. Nothing in the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions in these Islands justifies such a procedure. This remedy, being an extraordinary remedy, the law, during the entire history of the same, has required that extraordinary facts should be shown before the machinery of the court shall be put into operation in order to comply with the requests contained in the application therefor. Among other things the applicant must specifically show that unless he is granted this extraordinary remedy of mandamus he is without remedy, and the statutes in force here now provide specifically that the writ shall only issue when there is  \"no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.\" The clerk has no authority to examine a petition or application therefor and to determine whether or not a party is without other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, or whether the petition upon its face presents a prima facie case justifying the applicant in annoying the respondent to the extent of coming into court and showing why he should not be subjected to the provisions of this extraordinary writ. Not only has the clerk no authority by virtue of the statutes in force here to issue this order to show cause but, moreover, the Courts of First Instance of the Archipelago have their own numerous duties to perform, and should not be annoyed by the necessity of coming into this court and showing why a writ of mandamus should not be issued, when perhaps the application therefor shows no ground whatever justifying this court finally to issue the writ. In the application in the above said cause for the writ of mandamus there is not a single allegation showing to this court that the said applicant is without other  \"plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.\" This is a prerequisite allegation in the application for mandamus. This court should not be called upon to examine the law and the procedure for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the party has other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. These facts must be clearly set out and supported by affidavits. The writ is never awarded where the party has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by an ordinary action at law. It may be that the person has neglected his remedy and has placed himself in a position where the use of the usual and ordinary remedy is no longer available. This fact may be disclosed by the petition or application and would be sufficient to defeat his right to this extraordinary remedy. It is the duty of the court and not the clerk, to examine the application for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the party is entitled, prima facie, to this extraordinary remedy. The applicant must show that he is possessed of a legal right to have some legal duty performed by the respondent, and that he has no other legal, specific remedy except by mandamus. The applicant is not entitled, as a matter of right, to the remedy by mandamus or even to an order to the respondents to show cause why the same should not issue. The granting or withholding of the writ of mandamus is always an exclusive, discretionary right on the part of the court. Mandamus lies only to compel the performance of duties purely ministerial in their nature. So far as the petition discloses, the applicant in this cause is not without other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. The petition contains no allegations whatever upon that question. We are opposed to the practice inaugurated by this court in allowing the clerk to issue an order to show cause in an application for mandamus without first presenting the application therefor to this court or to some judge thereof. It is a loose and dangerous practice, which submits respondents to much unnecessary annoyance and the expenditure of much time and labor. We are informed that the court adopted the rule of allowing a summons to issue as in ordinary civil actions, upon an application for mandamus, upon that part of section 222 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions which reads as follows:  \"and the court, on trial, finds the allegations of the complaint to be true.\" The court held that the phrase  \"on trial\" meant that there should be a trial in the Supreme Court, and that therefore the application for mandamus was the commencement of an ordinary civil action and should take the course of ordinary civil actions. The court, however, in certiorari and prohibition proceedings has adopted the practice of issuing an order to show cause, thereby treating certiorari proceedings as extraordinary proceedings — not allowing the writ to issue until after the court had examined the sufficiency of the application. Upon an examination of section 217 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, we find exactly the same language with reference to the issuance of. process that is found in section 222. The language is as follows:  \"and the court, on trial, finds the allegations of the complaint to be true.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It will be seen, therefore, that the legislature used the same language in each of these statutes. Not only that but in section 226, relating to the remedy of prohibition, we find the same language, which is as follows:  \"and the court, on trial, shall find that the allegations of the complaint are true.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Why the court should have adopted a different practice under the above-quoted provisions of these various sections, is more than we can understand. Why they should have treated mandamus as an ordinary remedy, which has never been so regarded by any court, and treat certiorari and prohibition as extraordinary remedies, which have seldom been so regarded, when the language of the statutes is the same, does seem to us at least novel.\n",

      "MAJORITY OPINION. The majority of the court being of opinion that the language of the instrument commuting the sentence of the applicant from twenty to six years’ imprisonment clearly expresses the intention of the commuting authority, in granting the commutation, to so limit the grant, that the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit thereof unless he actually serves six years’ imprisonment, this period of imprisonment to terminate on February 26, 1910, thus denying to the petitioner the right to diminish his commuted sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1533, the application should be and is hereby denied. Arellano, C.J. , Torres, Mapa, Carson and Willard, JJ. , MINORITY OPINION. JOHNSON, J. , concurring in the result: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library From the record it appears that the petitioner herein, Juan Toledo, was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 6th day of June, 1903, to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years. He was charged with the crime of bandolerismo. From this decision he appealed to the Supreme Court. On the 27th day of February, 1904, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. 1 Later, on the 20th day of August, 1908, His Excellency, James F. Smith, Governor-General, commuted said sentence, by reducing the same to a term of imprisonment of six years  \"conditioned upon his good behavior for five years subsequent to his release, and further conditioned that during said period he report in person or by sworn statement, setting forth his place of residence and occupation to the Director of Constabulary and chief of police, city of Manila, and also to the provincial governor, and the senior inspector of Constabulary of the province in which he is residing; such reports to be made on the first days of January, May, and September of each year, or oftener, if required by the Governor-General. Should the conditions of this commutation be violated, the unexpired portion of his sentence will remain in full force and effect. Juan Toledo will be released from confinement upon the conditions above stated, when he shall have actually served six years’ imprisonment, to wit, on February 26, 1910.\" cralaw virtua1aw library On the 5th day of December, 1908, the said Juan Toledo presented a petition in the Supreme Court praying that a writ of habeas corpus be granted him. The principal ground of said petition is that the defendant is not being given the benefit of Act No. 1533 of the Philippine Commission, which is  \"An Act providing for the diminution of sentences imposed upon prisoners convicted of any offense and sentenced for a definite term of more than thirty days, and less than life, in consideration of good conduct and diligence.\" Said Act (No. 1533) provides for the diminution of sentences of prisoners for good conduct as follows: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library (a)\tDuring the first two years of imprisonment, providing that his conduct justifies it, a deduction of five days for each month, from the period of his sentence. (b)\tAfter he has served two full years of his sentence, the deduction shall be eight days for each month. (c)\t After he has served five full years of his sentence, the deduction shall be ten days for each month. (d)\t After he has served ten full years of his sentence, the deduction from his term shall be fifteen days for each month. The term month, as used in this Act is defined in Act No. 1559 to mean thirty days. The pretension of the petitioner is that the Governor-General having commuted his sentence to a period of six years and he having served, allowing for good time, a period of six years, he is entitled to his liberty. The petitioner overlooks the fact that the Governor reduced the period of imprisonment to six years, but expressly fixed the date upon which period of imprisonment should expire, to wit, February 26, 1910. There is no question raised with reference to the power of the Governor to pardon. See letter of January 3, 1903, of Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, to Hon. William H. Taft, Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands, which letter contains the following paragraph: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands is authorized to exercise the power to grant pardons, reprieves, and commutations of sentences in cases involving offenses against the laws of the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Said letter also contains the following paragraphs: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The Civil Governor in exercising said authority shall act ’by authority of the President of the United States.’ \"All pardons granted by the Civil Governor shall be reported to the Secretary of War for presentation to the President.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The Governor-General having the power to pardon, reprieve, or to commute the sentence, had the power to make such pardon, reprieve, or commutation absolute or conditional. It is contended that the Governor had no authority to fix the day upon which the term of imprisonment should expire, for the reason that he thereby prevented the applicant from securing the benefits of said Act No. 1533, or, in other words, that the Governor-General, by fixing the day for the termination of the sentence violated or set aside the provisions of said Act (No. 1533.) In my opinion this contention is not tenable. The Governor-General, in granting a pardon such as was granted in the present case, no more violates the provisions of the law nor prevents the operation of the provisions of the law, in the present case, than he does in any case when he pardons a man, for instance, who was sentenced for life, because the law, the Spanish Penal Code, in each case fixes the penalty which must be imposed under certain facts. For example, under certain facts, criminals must be sentenced to death, and the courts have no discretion in the imposition of such penalty. No one questions the right of the Governor-General to commute the death sentence imposed to a sentence for life or to an absolute pardon. No one hitherto has even suggested that the Governor-General, in exercising the pardoning power in this way, had attempted to set aside the law. He simply exercised a power of sovereignty confided in him. The application for the writ of habeas corpus should be denied. Endnotes: 1. Not reported.\n",

      "MAJORITY OPINION. The majority of the court being of opinion that the language of the instrument commuting the sentence of the applicant from twenty to six years’ imprisonment clearly expresses the intention of the commuting authority, in granting the commutation, to so limit the grant, that the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit thereof unless he actually serves six years’ imprisonment, this period of imprisonment to terminate on February 26, 1910, thus denying to the petitioner the right to diminish his commuted sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1533, the application should be and is hereby denied. Arellano, C.J. , Torres, Mapa, Carson and Willard, JJ. , MINORITY OPINION. JOHNSON, J. , concurring in the result: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library From the record it appears that the petitioner herein, Juan Toledo, was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 6th day of June, 1903, to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years. He was charged with the crime of bandolerismo. From this decision he appealed to the Supreme Court. On the 27th day of February, 1904, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. 1 Later, on the 20th day of August, 1908, His Excellency, James F. Smith, Governor-General, commuted said sentence, by reducing the same to a term of imprisonment of six years  \"conditioned upon his good behavior for five years subsequent to his release, and further conditioned that during said period he report in person or by sworn statement, setting forth his place of residence and occupation to the Director of Constabulary and chief of police, city of Manila, and also to the provincial governor, and the senior inspector of Constabulary of the province in which he is residing; such reports to be made on the first days of January, May, and September of each year, or oftener, if required by the Governor-General. Should the conditions of this commutation be violated, the unexpired portion of his sentence will remain in full force and effect. Juan Toledo will be released from confinement upon the conditions above stated, when he shall have actually served six years’ imprisonment, to wit, on February 26, 1910.\" cralaw virtua1aw library On the 5th day of December, 1908, the said Juan Toledo presented a petition in the Supreme Court praying that a writ of habeas corpus be granted him. The principal ground of said petition is that the defendant is not being given the benefit of Act No. 1533 of the Philippine Commission, which is  \"An Act providing for the diminution of sentences imposed upon prisoners convicted of any offense and sentenced for a definite term of more than thirty days, and less than life, in consideration of good conduct and diligence.\" Said Act (No. 1533) provides for the diminution of sentences of prisoners for good conduct as follows: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library (a)\tDuring the first two years of imprisonment, providing that his conduct justifies it, a deduction of five days for each month, from the period of his sentence. (b)\tAfter he has served two full years of his sentence, the deduction shall be eight days for each month. (c)\t After he has served five full years of his sentence, the deduction shall be ten days for each month. (d)\t After he has served ten full years of his sentence, the deduction from his term shall be fifteen days for each month. The term month, as used in this Act is defined in Act No. 1559 to mean thirty days. The pretension of the petitioner is that the Governor-General having commuted his sentence to a period of six years and he having served, allowing for good time, a period of six years, he is entitled to his liberty. The petitioner overlooks the fact that the Governor reduced the period of imprisonment to six years, but expressly fixed the date upon which period of imprisonment should expire, to wit, February 26, 1910. There is no question raised with reference to the power of the Governor to pardon. See letter of January 3, 1903, of Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, to Hon. William H. Taft, Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands, which letter contains the following paragraph: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands is authorized to exercise the power to grant pardons, reprieves, and commutations of sentences in cases involving offenses against the laws of the Civil Government of the Philippine Islands.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Said letter also contains the following paragraphs: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The Civil Governor in exercising said authority shall act ’by authority of the President of the United States.’ \"All pardons granted by the Civil Governor shall be reported to the Secretary of War for presentation to the President.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The Governor-General having the power to pardon, reprieve, or to commute the sentence, had the power to make such pardon, reprieve, or commutation absolute or conditional. It is contended that the Governor had no authority to fix the day upon which the term of imprisonment should expire, for the reason that he thereby prevented the applicant from securing the benefits of said Act No. 1533, or, in other words, that the Governor-General, by fixing the day for the termination of the sentence violated or set aside the provisions of said Act (No. 1533.) In my opinion this contention is not tenable. The Governor-General, in granting a pardon such as was granted in the present case, no more violates the provisions of the law nor prevents the operation of the provisions of the law, in the present case, than he does in any case when he pardons a man, for instance, who was sentenced for life, because the law, the Spanish Penal Code, in each case fixes the penalty which must be imposed under certain facts. For example, under certain facts, criminals must be sentenced to death, and the courts have no discretion in the imposition of such penalty. No one questions the right of the Governor-General to commute the death sentence imposed to a sentence for life or to an absolute pardon. No one hitherto has even suggested that the Governor-General, in exercising the pardoning power in this way, had attempted to set aside the law. He simply exercised a power of sovereignty confided in him. The application for the writ of habeas corpus should be denied. Endnotes: 1. Not reported.\n",

      "Per CURIAM p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library The decision of the court below being in accordance with the facts and the law, it is hereby affirmed with costs. Arellano, C.J. , Torres and Trent, JJ. , Separate Opinions MORELAND, J. , concurring: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library On the 2d day of September, 1911, in an action pending in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in which the Manila Trading and Supply Company was plaintiff and Tan Pian, doing business as Quim Liong Juat, was defendant, judgment was rendered in favor of the former and against the latter for P7,224.22 with interest and costs. On the 6th day of September the defendant gave notice of a motion for a new trial, and on the same day the plaintiff and the judgment creditor presented a motion praying that execution be issued on the judgment, notice of the said motion being given to Messrs. O’Brien & DeWitt, Attorneys for defendant and judgment creditor presented another motion, supported by affidavits, alleging that the judgment debtor was about to dispose of his property with intent to defraud his creditors and asked that a writ of attachment be issued against the property of said debtor. This made of procedure was made necessary, says the judgment creditor, by the fact that the motion for a new trial was pending and execution could not be issued until it was disposed of, and certain creditors of the judgment debtor were availing themselves of the delay occasioned by the filing of defendant’s motion for a new trial to purchase all of the property of the judgment debtor and to apply it on their indebtedness and thus prevent the judgment creditor from reaching it by ordinary legal process. Upon the filing of plaintiff’s petition for a writ of attachment of court, instead of granting the writ, found that good grounds existed for the immediate issuance of execution and so ordered, it being provided that execution be stayed on the presentation of a supersedes bond by the judgment debtor. Execution was accordingly issued on the 9th day of September and immediately placed in the hands of the sheriff. While the execution of the judgment was in suspense, owing to the pendency of the motion for a new trial above referred to, and on the 8th day of September, 1911, Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, Forbes, Munn & Co., and the judgment debtor, with full knowledge of the plaintiff’s judgment and the efforts being made to collect it, came together and prepared a document by means of which the judgment debtor acknowledged himself indebted to Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, in a certain sum, and for the purpose of paying and satisfying this debt, assigned and transferred all his property to Behn, Meyer & co., Limited, it being stipulated that the said Tan Pian should be responsible for the payment of all his obligations excepting only that referred to in the instrument. Forbes, Munn & Co., were not parties to this instrument and did not openly appear in the transaction, but there was some evidence that there was an agreement between this firm and the judgment debtor and Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, that Forbes, Munn & Co. should participate in the proceeds of the property which the judgment debtor conveyed to Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, and, consequently, the only remedy of the judgment creditor, if any, was to have the conveyance set aside and the debtor’s property subjected to his judgment. The sheriff in attempting to levy the execution issued on the Manila Trading and Supply Company’s judgment found a representative of Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, in possession, but proceeded nevertheless to levy upon the property and sell the same. The return made to the court after the sale showed a deficiency and the judgment creditor thereupon, by supplementary proceedings, brought Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, and Flobes, Munn & Co. into court for the determination of the validity of the so-called sale from the judgment debtor to Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited. Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, then brought this action against the sheriff. By order of court the two proceedings were consolidated and trial was has resulting in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for P1,610.32, the trial court finding that the conveyance in question was valid. Both parties appealed. The learned trial court stated the question before it as follows: \"These two proceedings were by agreement tried together, both involving a bill of sale (Exhibit A) executed on September 8, 1911, by the defendant in cause No. 8544 to the plaintiff in cause No. 8977. On September 2 a judgment had been rendered in the original cause No. 8544 (of which the present is a mere supplementary proceeding) in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for P7,224.22. The judgment creditor now seeks to have said bill of sale set aside as fraudulent, invoking in his behalf the presumption imposed by article 1297 of the Civil Code. That said presumption arises in this case is unquestionable, but it is a presumption only and may be rebutted by evidence that the sale was in fact bona fide and valid.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It is undisputed that the judgment debtor owed the vendee about P28,000 and that the sale of the property in controversy was made in partial consideration of said indebtedness. As the goods are not claimed even in the complaint cause No. 8977 to be worth more than P5,000, and as the judgment creditor contends that they were worth less that one-third of that sum, it will be seen that the transfer which is sought to be set aside covered a very small part of the undisputed indebtedness upon which the property transferred as applied. Under such circumstances was the bill of sale, so-called, of the goods here in controversy, given in satisfaction pro tanto of the said debt of P28,000, a fraud upon the creditors of the judgment debtor? We are of the opinion that it was not. This case cannot be distinguished from that of Peña v. Mitchell (9 Phil. Rep., 586). In that case the facts and the nature of the action sufficiently appear in the following quotation: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"As appears in the fourth finding of facts, judgment in the ’first instance’ had been rendered against P. B. Florence prior to the date of the sale to the plaintiff, and the court properly held that the presumption of fraud attached to said sale by virtue of the above-cited provisions of article 1297 of the Civil Code. But it will be observed that these provisions raise no more than a presumption of fraud which may be overthrown by competent testimony. Under the second finding of facts, the trial court found that the valuable consideration passing from the plaintiff purchaser to P. B. Florence and wife was the cancellation of a lawful indebtedness existing at the time of the sale; that this indebtedness actually existed and amounted to considerably more than P12,000; and that the object of the plaintiff in making the purchase of the property in question, valued at not more than P15,000, was to secure herself from loss of the amount which the said P. B. Florence was indebted to her. If there were no other facts in the case, these facts would be amply sufficient to rebut the presumption of fraud. \"The trial court, however, was of opinion that the other facts proven at the trial tended to establish the fraudulent character of the sale, and sustain the presumption of fraud established by the provisions of article 1297. These facts may be summarized as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"First. That at the time when the sale was made the vendor was insolvent, being indebted to other creditors than the plaintiff; that as a consequence the purchaser received payment in full for her debt while the remaining creditors received nothing. In other words, that the insolvent debtor by the terms of the contract with the plaintiff preferred one creditor over another in making the payment of his debts. \"Second. That the plaintiff, the preferred creditor, was the mother-in-law of the debtor. \"But there is no provision of existing law which forbids the preferring of one creditor over another by an insolvent debtor at his election, whether the preferred creditor be a relative or otherwise. Section 524 of Act No. 190 provides that: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"No new bankruptcy proceedings shall be instituted until a new bankruptcy law shall come into force in the Islands. All existing laws and orders relating to bankruptcy and proceedings therein are hereby repealed . . . .’ \"Thus all those bankruptcy provisions of the Civil Code, whereby an insolvent debtor was prohibited from making discriminations in favor of or against particular creditors, are repealed. The language of this section of Act No. 190 is so sweeping in its terms that it leaves no room for doubt as to its meaning or its effect, wherever a question arises as to its application. \"We are not unaware of the grave consequences entailed by a holding that there is no provision of law prohibiting an insolvent debtor from preferring one creditor over another in the payment of his debts; but this holding is a necessary consequence of the above-cited provisions of Act No. 190, enjoining the institution of bankruptcy proceedings ’until a new bankruptcy law shall come into force in the Islands.’ \"It appears therefore that the sale of the property in question was made to the plaintiff by the lawful owner thereof; that the parties to the sale were competent to enter into the contract; that there is no provision of law which forbade the execution of the contract by the parties; that the vendor was lawfully indebted to the plaintiff in an amount equal to or nearly equal to the value of the property sold; and that this indebtedness was the consideration which passed to the vendor, and was an adequate and a valuable consideration therefor. \"The presumption of fraud attaching to the sale of the property in question being overthrown by the evidence of record, the plaintiff is clearly entitled to the possession of the property in question.\" cralaw virtua1aw library From this quotation it is clear that there is no distinction between the case at bar and that one except, possibly, that, in the case at bar, there is more evidence of an intent to prevent the plaintiff in this case from collecting his judgment; or, perhaps it is more nearly correct to say that there is in this case clearer evidence of knowledge on the part of the persons engaged in the transfer as to the existence of other creditors and the effect which the transfer would have on them, particularly the judgment creditor; and there was a little sharper competition for the prize in this case than in that. But, under that case, we do not regard the intentions of the parties, good or bad, if they are properly called intentions, with respect to the other creditors of the vendor, or the fact that the competition between the contestants for the payment of their respective claims was extremely sharp, as having any bearing upon the validity of the transfer, provided it is clear that the property was really transferred for the purpose of satisfying, or of partially satisfying, the debt which the vendor owed to the vendee at the time and said debt was actually wholly satisfied or satisfied to the extent of the value of the property. If there was a debt actually existing, and if the transfer from the debtor to the creditor was real in the sense that the title actually passed and that the debt to that extent was extinguished, then, under the case of Peña v. Mitchell, the intention of the transferor and the transferee to deprive other creditors of any recourse and recovery against the vendor is of no consequence. The same result is obtained whatever be the intentions of the parties with respect to the other creditors. If the transfer was real and the title passed, if there was a real debt and by the transfer if became extinguished pro tanto, the transaction was legal no matter what the effect may have been on other creditors. The case of Peña v. Mitchell was carefully considered and the question involved thoroughly discussed not only upon the original decision but also upon a motion for a rehearing. The question as to the preference of creditors, of bankruptcy and all of the other elements which, under law entirely Spanish, might have had their influences upon the question before the court, was there fully considered and decided. We, therefore, have nothing to do but to follow that decision. The case of Oria v. McMicking (21 Phil. Rep., 243), cited by the appellant in this case, is not applicable. That was a sale rather than a payment — a sale instead of a preference of one creditor over another. There the sale was not only without proper consideration but was simulated. Here the transfer as well as the consideration is unquestioned. In that case the question of preference did not arise. It is clear that even though there be, apparently, a valuable and adequate consideration for a sale, if there is no sale in reality, but the parties simulate one for purpose of covering a situation, there is no sale at all and that the transaction is not only fraudulent as to consideration but simulated as to fact. There was no bona fides as to any part of the transaction.\n",

      "In the matter of the proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus , No. 10534, brought by J.C. Cowper against W. H. Dade, Director of Prisons, Manila, the court resolved: It appearing from the proceedings in this court that a remedy by appeal was available, the writ is denied. The body of J.C. Cowper will be remanded to the Director of Prisons and his bond canceled. Let judgment be entered to this effect, dismissing the complaint with costs against the petitioner. Separate Opinions MORELAND, J. , concurring and dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library The petitioner in this case was charged in the municipal court with the embezzlement of P20, funds of a mutual benefit association. He was tried, not under section 4 of Act No. 701 which punishes the crime of embezzlement when committed against a mutual benefit association, but under the provisions of the Penal Code defining estafa. He was convicted in the municipal court of the crime of estafa as defined by the Penal Code and sentenced to two months and one day of arresto mayor. He appealed to the Court of First Instance, which also tried him on the same charge and in the same manner and imposed the same penalty. The contention of the petitioner is that the crime described in the information in the municipal court being defined and punished by what he is pleased to term a special law and the punishment prescribed by that law being beyond the jurisdiction of the municipal court to impose, that court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter. He also contends that estafa committed against a mutual benefit association being, at the time of the trial, punishable under a special law, the provisions of the Penal Code which, before the law was passed, would have been applicable to such an estafa or embezzlement must give way to the Act; that, as a necessary consequence, the penalty imposed by the municipal court was imposed without sanction of law, the Act not authorizing the penalty of arresto mayor. By virtue of these considerations the petitioner asserts that the municipal court had no jurisdiction; that by reason of that fact the appellate court was limited in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to the vacation, reversal, or annulment of the judgment of conviction and the penalty imposed thereunder and, therefore, had no jurisdiction to try the case on the merits. He declares, as a necessary consequence, that the judgment of conviction of the Court of First Instance and the penalty imposed thereunder are void and of no effect, having been entered and imposed without jurisdiction. I agree, with the slight limitation hereinafter mentioned, with the court in dismissing the application for the writ and remanding the prisoner. I do not put the dismissal of the petition on the ground that there is an appeal from the judgment of conviction, the imprisonment under which is the subject of the application. I cannot conceive that the right to appeal is an obstacle to the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus where the grounds exist which authorize and require its issuance. I base my concurrence on two grounds: (1) The municipal court had jurisdiction of the crime; and (2) if there was no jurisdiction in the municipal court, the trial in the Court of First Instance must be held, under the repeated decisions of this court, to have been one had in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, no objection to the exercise of that jurisdiction having been made. (U. S. v. Bernardo, 19 Phil. Rep., 265; Carroll v. Paredes, 17 Phil. Rep., 94; U. S. v. Ang Suyco, 17 Phil. Rep., 92; Falcon v. Barretto, 26 Phil. Rep., 72; Nolan v. Montelibano, post, p. 236.) (1)\tI base my opinion, that the municipal court had jurisdiction of the crime described in the information, on the express provisions of the charter of the city of Manila, as amended, and Act No. 2017. Section 40 of the charter provides in part: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The limitations upon the criminal jurisdiction of the municipal court hereinbefore stated are subject, nevertheless, to the proviso that said court shall also have concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance over all criminal cases arising under the laws relating to gambling and management of lotteries, and to assaults where the intent to kill is not charged or evident upon the trial, to larceny and embezzlement where the amount of money or property stolen or embezzled does not exceed the sum or value of two hundred pesos, to the sale of intoxicating liquors, to falsely impersonating an officer, to malicious mischief, to trespass on Government or private property, and threatening to take human life; but in all such cases an appeal to the Court of First Instance upon proper application shall be allowed as in other cases.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Act No. 2017 consists of one section and reads: \"The word ’embezzlement’ as used in section forty of Act Numbered One hundred and eighty-three, entitled ’An Act to incorporate the city of Manila,’ as amended by section ten of Act Numbered Two hundred and sixty-seven, shall be construed to include the offense of ’estafa’ punished by the Penal Code.\" cralaw virtua1aw library If these Acts mean anything, or have any force, they confer jurisdiction on the municipal court, concurrent with that of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, to take cognizance of the crimes therein named and to try persons charged with those offenses and dispose of all matters involved in the trials as fully and completely as the Court of First Instance. This means, of course, that the municipal court has authority to impose the penalty required by law in case of conviction for any of the crimes referred to. It means nothing, legally speaking, that section 40 of Act No. 136 originally limited the jurisdiction of courts of justices of the peace to the imposition of a penalty not to exceed six months’ imprisonment or a fine not to exceed P200, or both. That provision was in existence at the time the jurisdiction of the municipal court was extended and the Legislature must be deemed to have enacted the amendments, including that made by Act No. 2017, if it may be called an amending Act, with full knowledge of the existence of that section and with the intent to deprive it of force where, by its application, it would prevent the municipal court from dealing fully and completely with the crimes which the amended charter authorized it to cognize. To hold that, while the municipal court has jurisdiction to try a person for the commission of an assault, for example, whereby the person assaulted lost an eye, the punishment for which might be twelve years under certain circumstances, it cannot impose on the offender more than six months’ imprisonment and P200 fine, is to abrogate and repeal the laws referred to. Such a penalty would be far below the minimum which could lawfully be imposed in such a case; and the necessary result would be that, while the court might try the case, it could impose no punishment. If the municipal court has jurisdiction of the crimes of embezzlement and estafa in all cases where the amount embezzled does not exceed P200, then it has jurisdiction of the crime defined and punished under section 4 of Act No 701. That Act is one which punishes the embezzlement of the funds of a mutual benefit association. The crime, by the wording of the statute and by all its essential elements, is embezzlement and the municipal court is, by the charter of the city of Manila, given jurisdiction over that crime no matter against whom or what it may be committed. The fact that Act No. 701 punishes the embezzlement of the funds of a mutual benefit association with a penalty which may reach five years’ imprisonment or P10,000 fine, or both, furnishes no reason for denying jurisdiction in that case to the municipal court; nor does the fact that Act No. 701 punishes the crime of embezzlement when committed against a particular entity make it such a special law as to take the crime out of the general class to which, by its very nature, it properly belongs. By virtue of its elements, as defined by the Act, it is the crime of embezzlement; and over that crime the municipal court is given complete jurisdiction without regard to the severity of the punishment or the person or thing against whom or which it is committed, provided the amount embezzled does not exceed P200. There is merit in the argument of the petitioner that Act No. 701 having punished, by a special penalty therein prescribed, the commission of the crime of estafa or embezzlement against a mutual benefit association, those provisions of the Penal Code under which, prior to the passage of the Act referred to, estafa or embezzlement against such an association would have been punished, are no longer applicable to such case. Viewed from this standpoint, the provisions of the Penal Code relative to estafa, when it is sought to apply them in a case where estafa has been committed against a mutual benefit association, and Act No. 701, deal with the same subject matter and define the same crime. It should be noted, however, that they punish the crime in a different manner. In a conviction under the Act it is impossible to apply the penalty prescribed by the Penal Code and in a conviction under the Penal Code it is impossible to apply the penalty prescribed by the Act. The two statutes in that respect are repugnant to each other and ought not to stand together. It is not permissible that two laws dictated by the same entity shall punish the commission of the same crime in a manner altogether different. This being the case, both courts were without jurisdiction to impose the penalty of arresto mayor. Both had the authority to imprison for two months and one day but not to impose the accessory penalties, or some of them, consequent upon the imposition of the penalty of arresto mayor. The writ should have been allowed, therefore, to the extent of remanding the prisoner with instructions to impose the proper penalty. This court, however, in view of the fact that an appeal was pending, thought, I assume, that such a correction could be made on the appeal when the matter came up for review on the merits, the character of the imprisonment suffered under the penalty imposed being precisely that which would be suffered if the penalty had been imposed under Act No. 701. (2)\tI am convinced that the writ should not be allowed, except to the extent just stated, on the further ground that, even though there was no jurisdiction in the municipal court over the subject matter of the action, the trial in the Court of First Instance must be held, under the decisions of this court, to have been had in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, no objection to the exercise of that jurisdiction having been made. (See cases already cited.) We have held in the cases referred to that, where a justice’s court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action and an appeal is taken to the Court of First Instance from judgment pronounced therein which expressly or impliedly sustains its jurisdiction, and the Court of First Instance, although it has no appellate jurisdiction to try the case on the merits, nevertheless, proceeds to try the case on the merits, it will be held that it was exercising its original and not its appellate jurisdiction, and if there was no objection by the appellant to the action of the court in trying the case on the merits, he will be deemed to have consented to the exercise by the court of its original jurisdiction and cannot thereafter be heard to say that it had no jurisdiction to perform the acts which he, by his failure to object, impliedly consented that it should perform. From these observations it is apparent that the Court of First Instance having, unquestionably, original jurisdiction of the subject matter of actions of the class before us, and having exercised its original jurisdiction in trying the case on the merits, it is of no consequence to the validity of its judgment whether the municipal court had jurisdiction or not. Its judgment is valid and the penalty imposed thereunder, when imposed in accordance with law, is a valid penalty. In some of the cases considered by this court where the question just discussed has been in issue the court has failed to distinguish between an objection made in the Court of First Instance to the effect that the municipal court had no jurisdiction of the action, and an assignment of error in the Court of First Instance, as an appellate court, based on the lack of jurisdiction of the municipal court. Strictly speaking, an objection in the appellate court of the lack of jurisdiction of the justice’s court has no significance as it is not addressed to any question pending before the appellate court, nor does it present a question for its determination. The case is before that court on appeal and the only questions which can arise are those presented by the appeal. The duty of the appellant is fully discharged in pointing out the errors committed by the justice’s court upon which he bases his claim for a reversal or annulment, and the duty of the appellate court is equally well performed in resolving the questions raised by the errors assigned. The error which the appellant should assign, when the justice’s court had no jurisdiction, is that the justice’s court erred in taking cognizance of the case and resolving the questions involved; and, basing himself on that error, he should pray for the annulment of the judgment. He should not ask for or consent to, expressly or impliedly, a trial on the merits; and if the appellate court proceeds to a trial on the merits, he should register his objection. If the appellant desires to limit the appellate court strictly to the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, he should not consent, expressly or impliedly, to the exercise by the appellate court of its original, instead of its appellate, jurisdiction. An objection made in a Court of First Instance directed against an act of a justice’s court can have no bearing on the conduct of the Court of First Instance. If a party desires to influence the action of a Court of First Instance, he must present his objection to the acts of that court or he must pray for some act of that court. It is evident that an objection directed to a Court of First Instance against an act of a justice’s court, giving the word \"objection\" its ordinary and real significance, goes to no question pending in that court and raises no question for its consideration. It is substantially meaningless. On the other hand, an assignment of error in the appellate court based on some act of a justice’s court is quite another matter. Such a proceeding goes directly to a question pending in that court and one which the appellate court has before it for resolution, viz., that arising on the appeal from the justice’s court. I am quite agreeable to the pronouncement of the court that there is an appeal in this case, and that irrespective of whether the municipal court had jurisdiction of the crime or not. It was certainly a crime over which the Court of First Instance had original jurisdiction and, in all such cases, the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is preserved by the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902. So that, while the municipal court had jurisdiction to try the case, the jurisdiction was concurrent with that of the Court of First Instance, and was one in which the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction. It will not be presumed that, in granting the municipal court jurisdiction concurrent with that of the Court of First Instance over certain crimes, the Legislature attempted or intended to deprive the Supreme Court of the appellate jurisdiction which it previously had in such cases. Moreover the wording of section 43 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is worthy of note. So far as material it reads: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"SEC. 43. Appeals. — From all final judgments of the Court of First Instance or courts of similar jurisdiction, and in all cases in which the law now provides for appeals from said courts, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court as hereinafter prescribed . . .\" cralaw virtua1aw library Is the justice’s court a court of \"similar jurisdiction\" when it has concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance? When two courts have concurrent jurisdiction are they not, to that extent, not only courts of \"similar jurisdiction\" but courts of equal jurisdiction? And, in cases where the justice’s court has jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of First Instance, does this section not permit an appeal direct to the Supreme Court from the justice’s court? I ask these questions by way of suggestion and not for the purpose of answering them.\n",

      "ARELLANO, C.J. p On May 3, 1895, there was inscribed in the property registry of Albay an urban estate consisting of a lot, on which stood at that time a camarin or small store, situated on Calle Velarde of the pueblo of Legaspi; the said parcel contained an area of 35 ares and 1 centare, and was bounded on the north by the land occupied by the public market, on the east by the highway leading to Tabaco, on the south by the lots of Francisco Cepeda and Maxima Azaña, and on the west by a public alley and public land. This inscription was made in the name of Juan Tiamson, by means of a possessory information title duly approved. (Exhibit 3.) On January 27, 19p3, after the death of Juan Tiamson, eight people, some of them surnamed Narciso and others Padilla, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Albay against Maria Tiamson, his mother who survived him and against Magno Tiamson, his eldest child. The object of the complaint was to recover said land (Exhibit 1). Maria Tiamson answered the complaint and alleged that the land referred to therein had been her exclusive property since the year 1848; that as such exclusive owner she disposed of it in behalf of her son Juan Tiamson, father of the defendant Magno Tiamson; that about 23 years previous, by reason of said conveyance, Juan Tiamson entered upon the possession of the land, quietly and peaceably continued therein, and performed acts of ownership as such proprietor; and that, on the death of Juan Tiamson, his children, the eldest of whom is Magno Tiamson, succeeded him in his ownership and possession. (Exhibit 2.) On November 12, 1912, the present complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of Albay. It Prays that said land be divided into four parts— one for Pedro Tiamson, another for Pablo Tiamson, a third for the children of Victorina Tiamson, and, finally, another for the children of Juan Tiamson. The plaintiffs are Pedro Tiamson, Pablo Tiamson, and eight others all children and grandchildren of Victorina Tiamson. The defendants are the three children of Juan Tiamson. The complaint alleges that Maria Tiamson died in or about the year 1903, and that Pedro Pablo, Victorina and Juan Tiamson were or are natural, recognized children of the deceased Maria Tiamson. The defendants, besides a general denial, set up as a special defense the fact of their quiet and peaceable possession as owners for more than ten years, their father Juan Tiamson’s likewise quiet and peaceable possession as such for more than twenty years, and, consequently, prescription for a period of more than ten years, confirmed by acts of ownership performed on the land consisting of improvements, inasmuch as they had constructed thereon ware- houses and two small houses of mixed material, all valued at more than P8,000; this amount, they claimed, should be reimbursed to them if the case were decided against them. After an examination of plaintiffs’ evidence, which was merely parol, and defendants’ both parol and documentary evidence, the court, considering that the former had not proved any right whatever in the land in question, ordered that the case should be dismissed and that plaintiffs should pay the costs. Plaintiffs appealed. An action having been brought for the division of a parcel of land supposed to be pro indiviso property and to have remained such at the death of Maria Tiamson, plaintiffs have proceeded by begging the question. The first question, to be precise, is whether Maria Tiamson left the disputed land at her death, in order to suppose it to be pro indiviso property; and the second is whether plaintiffs have any right in the land concerned, in order to require its division. With respect to the first point, it is obvious that prior to Maria Tiamson’s death she herself, answering a complaint in 1903, stated that twenty-three years previous the land belonged to Juan Tiamson for the reason that she had conveyed it to him. This is fully proven by the document Exhibit 3, one that was recorded in the property registry and that has not been controverted from 1895 to 1912. But, inasmuch as the registrant Juan Tiamson stated in his petition for possessory information title that he had acquired the land under title of \"a devise (herencia) made by his mother, Agueda Maria Tiamson, on the day she contracted marriage, about fifteen years before the date of the petition,\" appellants now allege that title cannot be recognized as an ownership title in behalf of Juan Tiamson, (1) because there can be no title by devise (herencia) from a person who is living, and Maria Tiamson was still living when Juan Tiamson recorded in his said petition a title by devise from his mother, Maria Tiamson, to himself; (2) because, even though the title invoked by the registrant Juan Tiamson be considered as one of gift by reason of marriage, it is not shown that it was bestowed in a public instrument, as required by article 633 of the Civil Code, it being a gift of real property, and that even though this fact of the manner of bestowal had appeared, the gift would in all events be null and void, because a mother cannot bestow all her property upon a single child, and Maria Tiamson had no other property beside said land. The true title recorded in the possessory information and in the registry is that of a gift by reason of marriage. The gift must have been made in 1880, fifteen years prior to the registration in 1895. In 1880 the Civil Code was not in force as it was promulgated only in December, 1889. The statute which, in 1880, governed gifts by reason of marriage, was law 9, title 4, of the fifth Partida, and that law did not require an instrument except where the amount of the gift exceeded 500 maravedises gold, and the value of the donated land mentioned in the registration, to wit, P200, nowhere near reaches that amount. (Barretto v. City of Manila, 7 Phil. Rep., 596.) With regard to the second point, plaintiffs aver in the their complaint that they are natural, recognized children of Maria Tiamson; but defendants deny it. Beyond the evidence produced by Pablo Tiamson, plaintiffs have adduced no proof whatever of such natural filiation, still less of their recognition as natural children, which is what would have entitled them to inherit from Maria Tiamson. As the registered title which is positive and direct has been firmly sustained, it is unnecessary to consider that of prescription, which, for various reasons, had the first mentioned title not prospered, would have been given due weight in view of the thirty-two years’ possession, duly proven. The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the cost against the appellants. So ordered. Torres, Johnson, Carson, Trent and Araullo, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "The decision rendered in this case was filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court on December 13, 1916. 1 The parties were notified on the 14th of the same month. Judgment was entered by the Clerk of the Court on January 4, 1917. The record was returned to the lower court on January 15, 1917. Later a writ of execution was issued and delivered to the sheriff. Subsequently, on January 25, 1917, counsel for the defendant filed in this Court a motion praying for a stay of execution was issued and delivered to the sheriff. Subsequently, on January 25, 1917, counsel for the defendant filed in this Court a motion praying for a stay of execution of the judgment and return of the record for the purposes of the writ of certiorari which the defendant seeks to sue out before the Supreme Court of the United States. After due consideration thereof, the said motion is denied for the reason that the record has already been returned to the Court of First Instance for execution of the judgment. Justice Trent is of the opinion that the motion should be granted. Separate Opinions CARSON, J. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I dissent. A stay of execution should be granted, it clearly appearing that the party seeing it has a right under the law to take the money judgment of this court to the Supreme Court of the United States for review, the amount of that judgment being in excess of $25,000; that he is taking the necessary steps, in good faith, to secure such a review; that he has used diligence in moving for a stay; and that he has tendered a good and sufficient bond to secure compliance with any judgment which may finally be entered against him. It is not a sufficient ground upon which to deny relief in this case to say that as a result of the change of procedure in the method whereby such appeals were formerly perfected, we cannot grant a writ of supersedeas in the identical form and manner in which we were authorized to grant such writs under the old procedure. The change of procedure was certainly not intended to have the effect of depriving litigants of any right to a stay of execution pending appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States which was secured to them under the former statute. Until and unless the Supreme Court of the United States takes jurisdiction this court and this court alone has jurisdiction in the premises. In every case wherein a litigant seeks to exercise his right to have a judgment of this court reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States under the procedure prescribed in the new law, a period of from sixty to ninety days must elapse from the entry of final judgment by his court before the court above can be given an opportunity to take jurisdiction of the case. It must be assumed that during that period this court has at least sufficient supervisory jurisdiction over the execution of its own judgments to control and restrain any attempt to enforce these judgments in cases wherein their immediate execution would deprive the litigant of a right which, heretofore, has always been secured to him, to have execution stayed by the exercise of due diligence in prosecuting his appeal — a right which it was not the intention of the legislators to destroy by the change in the mode of procedure in prosecuting the appeal. It is said that had the application been made to us during the period of ten days after final judgment was entered and before the record was returned to the court below, we might then have held the record in this court for a time sufficient to allow an application for the writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. But, it is to be observed, in the first place, that while we might have had the power so to do and while the delay thus incurred would have had the indirect effect of staying the execution, the practice of granting such delays while it might conserve the rights of the rights of the prevailing cases, would take no account of the rights of the prevailing party, who should have execution of his judgment without delay unless proper security is furnished by the party seeking to stay execution pending the appeal. An order directing that the record be retained in the court under such circumstances is in effect a grant of a stay of execution, by indirection, in which the prevailing party is deprived of his right to security for the performance of the judgment by the party at whose instance the stay is granted. In the second place, a period of ten days from the entry of final judgment does not give a litigant sufficient time within which to determine whether or not he should appeal, and having determined so to do, to furnish the security without which stay of execution should not be granted. Heretofore, litigants always had at least sixty days within which they could secure a stay of execution in a case wherein the filing of a supersedeas bond was authorized. I do not believe that the substantial rights of the litigant in this regard are preserved under the rule which it is now proposed to follow, under which he is deprived of the right to a stay of execution unless he moves within ten days after the entry of final judgment. The following paragraph from Freeman on Executions, together with the citations of authority in support of the pertinent comment in the original, sets forth the doctrine which in my opinion should be applied under the very exceptional circumstances of this case: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Stay of execution other than by appellate proceedings. — During the time within which plaintiff is otherwise entitled to execution his right thereto maybe suspended or destroyed by what is commonly known as a stay of execution, granted by the court in which the judgment was rendered or by some other court of superior authority, or arising without any formal order of any court as a result of proceedings authorized by statute. These stays of execution may be regarded as of three classes, first, those which are ordered by the court in which the judgment was rendered, but not as the result of any appellate proceedings, and which proceed upon the ground that, for some cause, the execution of judgment ought to be postponed to some subsequent date, or, perhaps, ought not to take place at all; second, those which are a consequence of, or attend, appellate proceedings; and third, those which result from statutes granting the defendant a further time in which to satisfy the judgment upon his giving certain security therefor. Each court has such general control of its process as enables it to act for the prevention of all abuse thereof. Hence it may, to prevent the annoyance which might be occasioned by the attempted execution of a void judgment, either stay by the attempted execution of a void judgment, either stay or arrest the process; and may, where it is clear that the judgment ought not to be further enforced, order a perpetual stay of execution. If it appears that the proceedings have been instituted which may result in the annulment of the judgment or in granting the defendant a release therefrom, its further execution maybe suspended until the result of such proceedings can be known. If proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency have been commenced which may result in the release of the defendant, it is proper to stay execution for a reasonable time to permit him to so far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either be obtained or denied. If an action has been brought in bankruptcy or insolvency have been commenced which may result in the release of the defendant, it is proper to stay execution for a reasonable time to permit him to so far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either be obtained or denied. If an action has been brought upon a judgment from which a writ of error has been recovered, execution thereon should be stayed until the first is either reversed or affirmed; otherwise, the party prosecuting the writ of error may, though successful, be deprived of all benefit thereof. A perpetual stay of execution may be granted by the court in which the judgment was rendered, when such judgment was void when entered, or when, from some cause occurring after its entry, it is clear that the further prosecution thereof ought not to be allowed. The most familiar instance, other than that by the satisfaction of the judgment, of a matter occurring after its entry and requiring a perpetual stay of execution, is the release of the defendant and his property therefrom by a discharge granted him under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws. \"When an appellate court has affirmed a judgment and remitted the case to the subordinate court, the latter has no right to stay execution. This rule ought not to prevent a temporary stay of execution upon grounds which do not question the correctness of the judgment thus affirmed, as where it is urged that the defendant has a judgment against the plaintiff to the benefit of which he is entitled as a set-off. Such set-off may be allowed him without in any respect questioning the propriety of the judgment of the appellate court, and stay of execution may properly be granted until the claim of set-off can be investigated and determined. \"The power of court to temporarily stay the issuing of execution is exercised in an almost infinite variety of circumstances, in order that the ends of justice may be accomplished. In many cases this power operates almost as a substitute for proceedings in equity, and enables the defendant to prevent any inequitable use of the judgment or writ. Like most other discretionary powers, it is liable to abuse. It is the general practice of the losing party to ask and for the court to grant a stay of execution for some designated period after the entry of judgment, for no other reason than that he is not yet ready to comply with the judgment, or perhaps in view of proceedings by appeal or for a new trial. These stays generally result in a delay, and sometimes in the defeat of justice; and the courts ought to be very cautious in granting them, except in cases where the ultimate satisfaction of the judgment by the defendant is assured. The power, however, to grant such stays of execution is everywhere conceded, and it could not be limited by the enactment of any unvarying rule without encountering evils of greater magnitude than those sought to be suppressed. The exercise of this power will sometimes be reviewed by the appellate court, but never ’unless capriciously exercised or abused.’ As the statutes in most of the states purport to give the plaintiff a right to execution for a definite period of time after the entry of judgment in his favor, it seems unreasonable to maintain that any court has a right to restrict this right or to interfere with its exercise, even for a temporary period, except for some well-defined reason, and therefore that the many orders made granting stays of execution without disclosing any other ground therefor than the desire or convenience of the applicant ought not to be sustained. While it was in one instance said that ’plaintiff having obtained his judgment, is entitled to enforce it unless it be set aside or modified in due curse of law,’ we infer that this apparently reasonable assertion is not maintainable under the existing decisions, and that on the other hand, each court may grant temporary stays of execution during which time the plaintiff has no right to a writ for the enforcement of his judgment, and no remedy other than by appeal or writ of error, and that these remedies will not aid him, except where there has been a manifest abuse of the discretion of the court in granting the stay.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Endnotes: 1.

      "The decision rendered in this case was filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court on December 13, 1916. 1 The parties were notified on the 14th of the same month. Judgment was entered by the Clerk of the Court on January 4, 1917. The record was returned to the lower court on January 15, 1917. Later a writ of execution was issued and delivered to the sheriff. Subsequently, on January 25, 1917, counsel for the defendant filed in this Court a motion praying for a stay of execution was issued and delivered to the sheriff. Subsequently, on January 25, 1917, counsel for the defendant filed in this Court a motion praying for a stay of execution of the judgment and return of the record for the purposes of the writ of certiorari which the defendant seeks to sue out before the Supreme Court of the United States. After due consideration thereof, the said motion is denied for the reason that the record has already been returned to the Court of First Instance for execution of the judgment. Justice Trent is of the opinion that the motion should be granted. Separate Opinions CARSON, J. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I dissent. A stay of execution should be granted, it clearly appearing that the party seeing it has a right under the law to take the money judgment of this court to the Supreme Court of the United States for review, the amount of that judgment being in excess of $25,000; that he is taking the necessary steps, in good faith, to secure such a review; that he has used diligence in moving for a stay; and that he has tendered a good and sufficient bond to secure compliance with any judgment which may finally be entered against him. It is not a sufficient ground upon which to deny relief in this case to say that as a result of the change of procedure in the method whereby such appeals were formerly perfected, we cannot grant a writ of supersedeas in the identical form and manner in which we were authorized to grant such writs under the old procedure. The change of procedure was certainly not intended to have the effect of depriving litigants of any right to a stay of execution pending appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States which was secured to them under the former statute. Until and unless the Supreme Court of the United States takes jurisdiction this court and this court alone has jurisdiction in the premises. In every case wherein a litigant seeks to exercise his right to have a judgment of this court reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States under the procedure prescribed in the new law, a period of from sixty to ninety days must elapse from the entry of final judgment by his court before the court above can be given an opportunity to take jurisdiction of the case. It must be assumed that during that period this court has at least sufficient supervisory jurisdiction over the execution of its own judgments to control and restrain any attempt to enforce these judgments in cases wherein their immediate execution would deprive the litigant of a right which, heretofore, has always been secured to him, to have execution stayed by the exercise of due diligence in prosecuting his appeal — a right which it was not the intention of the legislators to destroy by the change in the mode of procedure in prosecuting the appeal. It is said that had the application been made to us during the period of ten days after final judgment was entered and before the record was returned to the court below, we might then have held the record in this court for a time sufficient to allow an application for the writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. But, it is to be observed, in the first place, that while we might have had the power so to do and while the delay thus incurred would have had the indirect effect of staying the execution, the practice of granting such delays while it might conserve the rights of the rights of the prevailing cases, would take no account of the rights of the prevailing party, who should have execution of his judgment without delay unless proper security is furnished by the party seeking to stay execution pending the appeal. An order directing that the record be retained in the court under such circumstances is in effect a grant of a stay of execution, by indirection, in which the prevailing party is deprived of his right to security for the performance of the judgment by the party at whose instance the stay is granted. In the second place, a period of ten days from the entry of final judgment does not give a litigant sufficient time within which to determine whether or not he should appeal, and having determined so to do, to furnish the security without which stay of execution should not be granted. Heretofore, litigants always had at least sixty days within which they could secure a stay of execution in a case wherein the filing of a supersedeas bond was authorized. I do not believe that the substantial rights of the litigant in this regard are preserved under the rule which it is now proposed to follow, under which he is deprived of the right to a stay of execution unless he moves within ten days after the entry of final judgment. The following paragraph from Freeman on Executions, together with the citations of authority in support of the pertinent comment in the original, sets forth the doctrine which in my opinion should be applied under the very exceptional circumstances of this case: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Stay of execution other than by appellate proceedings. — During the time within which plaintiff is otherwise entitled to execution his right thereto maybe suspended or destroyed by what is commonly known as a stay of execution, granted by the court in which the judgment was rendered or by some other court of superior authority, or arising without any formal order of any court as a result of proceedings authorized by statute. These stays of execution may be regarded as of three classes, first, those which are ordered by the court in which the judgment was rendered, but not as the result of any appellate proceedings, and which proceed upon the ground that, for some cause, the execution of judgment ought to be postponed to some subsequent date, or, perhaps, ought not to take place at all; second, those which are a consequence of, or attend, appellate proceedings; and third, those which result from statutes granting the defendant a further time in which to satisfy the judgment upon his giving certain security therefor. Each court has such general control of its process as enables it to act for the prevention of all abuse thereof. Hence it may, to prevent the annoyance which might be occasioned by the attempted execution of a void judgment, either stay by the attempted execution of a void judgment, either stay or arrest the process; and may, where it is clear that the judgment ought not to be further enforced, order a perpetual stay of execution. If it appears that the proceedings have been instituted which may result in the annulment of the judgment or in granting the defendant a release therefrom, its further execution maybe suspended until the result of such proceedings can be known. If proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency have been commenced which may result in the release of the defendant, it is proper to stay execution for a reasonable time to permit him to so far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either be obtained or denied. If an action has been brought in bankruptcy or insolvency have been commenced which may result in the release of the defendant, it is proper to stay execution for a reasonable time to permit him to so far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either far prosecute such proceedings that his release can either be obtained or denied. If an action has been brought upon a judgment from which a writ of error has been recovered, execution thereon should be stayed until the first is either reversed or affirmed; otherwise, the party prosecuting the writ of error may, though successful, be deprived of all benefit thereof. A perpetual stay of execution may be granted by the court in which the judgment was rendered, when such judgment was void when entered, or when, from some cause occurring after its entry, it is clear that the further prosecution thereof ought not to be allowed. The most familiar instance, other than that by the satisfaction of the judgment, of a matter occurring after its entry and requiring a perpetual stay of execution, is the release of the defendant and his property therefrom by a discharge granted him under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws. \"When an appellate court has affirmed a judgment and remitted the case to the subordinate court, the latter has no right to stay execution. This rule ought not to prevent a temporary stay of execution upon grounds which do not question the correctness of the judgment thus affirmed, as where it is urged that the defendant has a judgment against the plaintiff to the benefit of which he is entitled as a set-off. Such set-off may be allowed him without in any respect questioning the propriety of the judgment of the appellate court, and stay of execution may properly be granted until the claim of set-off can be investigated and determined. \"The power of court to temporarily stay the issuing of execution is exercised in an almost infinite variety of circumstances, in order that the ends of justice may be accomplished. In many cases this power operates almost as a substitute for proceedings in equity, and enables the defendant to prevent any inequitable use of the judgment or writ. Like most other discretionary powers, it is liable to abuse. It is the general practice of the losing party to ask and for the court to grant a stay of execution for some designated period after the entry of judgment, for no other reason than that he is not yet ready to comply with the judgment, or perhaps in view of proceedings by appeal or for a new trial. These stays generally result in a delay, and sometimes in the defeat of justice; and the courts ought to be very cautious in granting them, except in cases where the ultimate satisfaction of the judgment by the defendant is assured. The power, however, to grant such stays of execution is everywhere conceded, and it could not be limited by the enactment of any unvarying rule without encountering evils of greater magnitude than those sought to be suppressed. The exercise of this power will sometimes be reviewed by the appellate court, but never ’unless capriciously exercised or abused.’ As the statutes in most of the states purport to give the plaintiff a right to execution for a definite period of time after the entry of judgment in his favor, it seems unreasonable to maintain that any court has a right to restrict this right or to interfere with its exercise, even for a temporary period, except for some well-defined reason, and therefore that the many orders made granting stays of execution without disclosing any other ground therefor than the desire or convenience of the applicant ought not to be sustained. While it was in one instance said that ’plaintiff having obtained his judgment, is entitled to enforce it unless it be set aside or modified in due curse of law,’ we infer that this apparently reasonable assertion is not maintainable under the existing decisions, and that on the other hand, each court may grant temporary stays of execution during which time the plaintiff has no right to a writ for the enforcement of his judgment, and no remedy other than by appeal or writ of error, and that these remedies will not aid him, except where there has been a manifest abuse of the discretion of the court in granting the stay.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Endnotes: 1.

      "STATEMENT The complaint alleges that the plaintiff and appellant \"is a duly registered partnership, domiciled and doing business in Manila.\" cralaw virtua1aw library \"That the Hon. Francis Burton Harrison is the duly appointed, qualified and acting Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, and, as such, its Chief Executive; that the Hon. Dionisio Jakosalem is the duly appointed, qualified and the official designated by executive order of the said Governor-General as the executive in charge of rice, its sale and distribution in the Philippine Islands; that the said Justo Lukban is the duly appointed, qualified and acting Mayor of the city of Manila, and, as such, designated by the said Governor-General and Secretary of Commerce and Communications as their assistant in charge for the city of Manila of rice, its sale and distribution. \"That on September 24, the plaintiff was the owner of 2,3301/2 kilos of rice, No. 1 quality, imported from Siam at a cost to plaintiff of P26.32, Philippine currency, per cavan, and 150 cavans of glutinous rice imported from Hongkong on the 14th day of July, 1919, at a cost of P22.25 per cavan that the said rice at the time of its purchase was bought in the open market and at the then prevailing market prices. \"That defendants, pursuant to Act No. 2868 of the Philippine Legislature and pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 56 and 67 issued by authority of said Act, have seized the said 2,3301/2 kilos of Siam rice of plaintiff and deprived him of it, for the purpose of distribution to the public at large; that said seizure was made without compensation to plaintiff, although defendants have promised to pay therefor at the rate of P16.25, Philippine currency, a cavan and no more, which price is below the reasonable value of the rice and is unjust; that payment at said rate does not constitute just compensation and seizure under the circumstances alleged constitutes a confiscation of private property contrary to the fundamental and organic law of the Philippine Islands and an invasion of those constitutional rights that no one may be deprived of his property except by due process of law and with just compensation; that the just and reasonable value of the rice seized as aforesaid in Manila at the time of said seizures was with respect to the Siam rice mentioned P26.32 per cavan. \"That so much of said Act No. 2868 and its dependent Executive Orders that fix an arbitrary maximum selling price for rice and corn is unconstitutional and void as being in contravention of the Constitution of the United States and the Jones Bill, in so far as they guarantee to individuals the right to own and dispose of lawful property as they please and guarantee that the same may not be taken without due process of law and just compensation.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That in so far as Act No. 2868 purports to make it a crime to sell rice above the maximum price fixed by Executive Orders, it is unconstitutional and an invasion of property rights guaranteed by the Jones Bill, and that defendants threaten prosecution for each violation. It is further alleged that the action is brought on behalf certain firms and generally on behalf of all rice importers, and that the enforcement of the provisions of Act No. 2868 would result in a great multiplicity of civil and criminal actions, and that this case is one of common and general interest affecting alike all dealers and importers of rice and corn, and that the reasonable price of the rice seized and confiscated is P26.25 per cavan. Plaintiff prays judgment as follows: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library First. That defendants, their subordinates, agents, attorneys and employees be enjoined from further seizure of rice stocks. Second. That defendants be ordered to return stocks seized as alleged or in lieu thereof pay to the owners a just and reasonable compensation therefor as may be fixed by this court. Third. That so much of Act No. 2868 as permits the fixing of a maximum sale price for rice and corn and provides for the punishment of infractions of said law be declared unconstitutional and its enforcement enjoined. Fourth. For such other and further relief as to this court may seem just and proper; to which the defendants filed the following demurrer: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I. The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the action, because — (1)\tThe court has no jurisdiction to control by injunction the official acts of the Governor-General, and (2)\tThis is in effect a suit against the State. II. There is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff, because, upon the facts alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff L. S. Moon & Co. has no right to sue on behalf of others not named in the complaint. III. The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because — (1)\tAct No. 1868 of the Philippine Legislature is constitutional, in that its enactment was a legitimate exercise of the police power of the State; (2)\tThe facts stated in the complaint do not entitle the plaintiffs to the relief demanded, in that — (a)\tPlaintiffs have another adequate remedy at law; (b)\tThe court has no jurisdiction to control by injunction the official acts of the Governor-General; (c) \"Plaintiff prays an injunction against the enforcement of a criminal statute upon the ground that it is unconstitutional; but the constitutionality of a criminal statute may not properly be determined in an against the Chief Executive for injunction, to prevent its enforcement. the validity of a criminal statute may be determined in a criminal action for an alleged violation thereof;\" and (d) \"The action is against the defendants in their respective official capacities, and no facts are alleged which, if proved, would authorize a personal judgment against defendants for the value of the seized by them in their official capacities pursuant to a statute, even though the statute be unconstitutional, and the law does not authorize a money judgment against these defendants as public officials by reason of acts performed by them in their official capacities.\" cralaw virtua1aw library IV. The complaint is, upon its face, ambiguous, intelligible and uncertain, particularly in the following respect, to wit: \". . . Plaintiff pleads irreparable injury by reason of the official acts of the defendants, and yet prays judgment against them for the return of the rice ’or in lieu thereof pay to the owners a just and reasonable compensation therefor as may fixed by this court.’\" Wherefore, defendants pray that the complaint be dismissed, with costs. The trial court sustained the demurrer upon the second, third, and fourth grounds, and overruled it as to the first, to which ruling the plaintiff duly excepted. The trial court sustained the demurrer upon the second, third, and fourth grounds, and overruled it as to the first, to which ruling the plaintiff duly excepted. October 8, 1920, the court dismissed the action, to which the plaintiff duly excepted and appealed to this court, as signing the following errors: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I. The lower court erred in sustaining the second ground of demurrer to the second amended complaint to the effect that there was a misjoinder of parties plaintiff. II. The lower court erred in sustaining the third ground of demurrer to the second amended complaint to the effect that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. III. The lower court erred in sustaining the fourth ground of demurrer to the second amended complaint to the effect that the complaint was ambiguous, unintelligible and uncertain. IV. The lower court erred in not holding the acts complained of as and illegal invasion of private rights and the Act (No. 2868) authorizing them as unconstitutional. V. The lower court erred in dismissing the action without first having had a trial on the merits. JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT The defendant, Smith, Bell & Co., Ltd., is a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the city of Manila. In 1918, the defendant Cowper was in the employ of the defendant corporation, which, among other things, was engaged in the sale of machinery and equipment for the use of manufacturers of coconut oil. As the result of negotiations with the company, on May 6, 1918, Cowper wrote the following letter: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I have arranged with Mr. Schmidt of your company, that I Mr. J. C. Cowper, and Mr. L. P. PHAGE shall receive half of the profits received from this deal.\" cralaw virtua1aw library This letter referred to what is known in the evidence as the Harden contract. Later, both plaintiffs here became associated with Cowper in finding purchasers and in the sale of such machinery for the defendant corporation. Outside of the above letter, there is no written contract as to what the plaintiffs should receive or the defendant should pay them for their services, and between PHAGE, Brown, and Cowper, as one party, and the defendant corporation, as the other. As a result of their services, a number of purchasers were found for the machinery with whom the defendant corporation entered into written contracts for its sale and delivery, and undertook in good faith to carry out the terms and provisions of the different contracts with the respective purchasers. The plaintiffs PHAGE and Brown now claim that the signing of the respective contracts by the company with the respective purchasers made and constituted a complete sale of the machinery, and that their compensation should be based upon the gross amount of the contracts, which should be construed as completed sales. In other words, when the contracts were signed, their services were complete and their commissions were earned. Claimed that the defendant company has breached its contract, and refused to account or settle with the plaintiffs for their services, they commenced this action, to recover from the defendant corporation, and because Cowper refused to join the plaintiffs, he was made a defendant in the action. Among other things, the complaint alleges that, under the terms and conditions of the contract, the plaintiffs and their associate Cowper were to seek buyers for the machinery which were accepted to the defendant company, and that the prices were to be fixed by the plaintiffs, as brokers, but which should, in no case, be less than P10,000 for each expeller, and that the date of delivery should not be specific but only approximate. \"That for their services the plaintiffs and associate, as partners, acting as broken for the defendant company, were to receive one-half of the difference between the cost of the machinery and equipment laid down in Manila, P. I., and the prices at which the same were sold to buyers secured by the said brokers.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That the plaintiffs secured orders for machinery and equipment and which were delivered to, and accepted by, the defendant company, as follows: (Here follows a list of the contracts, dates, with whom made, and amounts aggregating to P313,000.) It is then alleged that the purpose of carrying out the respective contracts, the defendant imported all of the specified machinery, but that it has failed and refused and still refuses to make any settlement with the plaintiffs or to render any accounting of the cost of the machinery, or to make any payments, either in full or on account, of the services rendered. That the plaintiffs have no way to determine the amount of the compensation which they should receive, and that it can only be ascertained by means of an accounting, which the defendant company should make. That they are entitled to recover approximately P35,000, and they pray that the defendant company be required within a reasonable time to furnish the plaintiffs a full and complete accounting, and to pay them the amount found to be due for the services rendered, upon which they should have interest from the time the machinery was imported, and for such other and further relief as may be just and equitable. For answer, the defendant admits that at the times alleged the plaintiffs were associated, as partners, under the firm name of the Philippine General Commercial Company; that it is a corporation as alleged; and that in the year, 1918, it engaged the plaintiff to act as brokers for the sale of machinery and equipment, and they delivered purchasers’ contracts to the defendant company which it accepted, amounting to P313,000, as alleged in paragraph 6 of the complaint. That the defendant J. C. Cowper was formerly a partner of the plaintiffs, and withdrew from the partnership on August 8, 1918, and that he had an interest in the amount which the plaintiffs should recover, but refused to join with them, and denies all other materials allegation of the complaint, and, as a further and separate defense, alleges that the plaintiffs and defendant Cowper secured orders for machinery and equipment, for which the company \"agreed to pay plaintiffs and the defendant J. C. Cowper, in equal shares, one-half of the net profits derived by said defendant, Smith, Bell & Co., Ltd., from said orders.\" cralaw virtua1aw library \"That delivery has been accepted on only one of the orders set out in the said complaint, to wit, that of A. Chicote, six expellers, P75,000, dated August 11,1918.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It is then alleged that outside of P2,000 paid by the Insular Coconut Oil Co., on its order of August 22, 1918, no other payments have been made on the respective contracts by any of the other purchasers, which were secured by the plaintiffs. That until such payments have been made, the defendant company cannot ascertain the net profits, but that it has received any profits whatever from any of the other orders, and that as soon as full payments of any order is made by the purchaser, the company will render an accounting to plaintiffs, and pay them any amount found due. Upon such issues, the case was tried, and a judgment was rendered for plaintiffs for P6,511.17, without interest or cost, from which they appealed, claiming that the court erred in failing to find that the plaintiffs were entitled to commission on two different contracts: that the court erred in holding that plaintiffs’ recovery should be based upon the defendant company realizing a profit on the respective contracts; and in rendering judgment without interest or costs.

March 17, 1919, the defendant Aw Yong Chiow Soo drew a bill of exchange or sight draft, for 33,500 Yen on Jing Kee & Co., 2 Kaisandori 5-Chone, Kobe, in favor of the Philippine National Bank, which at first it refused to cash. The plaintiff was then induced to, and did, endorse it, and the bank cashed the draft, no part of which plaintiff received, and it is claimed that all of the money was paid to Tan Liuan & Co. In the ordinary course of business, the draft was dishonored when presented, and later the plaintiff was requested to, and did, personally execute to the Philippine National Bank his promissory note, for the amount of the draft, interest and expenses. August 18, 1919, Tan Liuan made the following written statement: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"In consideration for the indorsement by Jose Velasco at my request of a draft drawn by Aw Yong Chiow Soo on Mess.

The complaint alleges the execution of the notes by the defendant Tan Liuan & Co. to the defendant Aw Yong Chiow Soo. That the defendant Aw Yong Chiow Soo indorsed the notes to the plaintiff; that at their maturity they were duly presented to Tan Liuan & Co.; and that payment was refused, of which refusal the defendant Aw Yong Chiow Soo was duly notified. For answer, Aw Yong Chiow Soo makes a general denial, and, as a further and separate defense, alleges the drawing of the sight draft, and that it was an accommodation only, and that, conforming to the agreement, it was duly indorsed by the plaintiff, and Aw Yong Chiow Soo delivered the money to the defendant Tan Liuan. The defendant then alleges the making of the written statement by Tan Liuan of August 18, 1919, above quoted. On that date, Aw Yong Co., evidenced by the promissory notes above described, and that Tan Liuan & Co. Was insolvent. That by reason thereof, one of the promissory notes was executed to guarantee Aw Yong Chiow Soo Against any liability in case that Tan Liuan or the plaintiff would not pay the sight draft, and because the bank had requested the plaintiff to pay the draft, this defendant and the plaintiff agreed that this defendant should transfer to him all of its interest in the four promissory notes, under an agreement that, in case Jing Kee & Co. should pay the draft, the plaintiff would re-transfer the notes to this defendant, but in the event that the plaintiff was required to pay the draft, that he would endeavor to collect the notes in full, and from the proceeds would first reimburse himself and then pay any remainder to the defendant. It is also alleged that the plaintiff has not paid the draft or made any effort to collect it from Tan Liuan. That this defendant is not liable to the plaintiff on any contract, and does not owe him anything, but that, under the agreement, the plaintiff should return to this defendant any amount which he should collect over the amount of his personal claim. That, by reason of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, Tan Liuan, this defendant has been released and discharged of all liability, and that the action is premature. Upon such issues, the case was tried, and the lower court rendered judgment against the defendants Tan Liuan & Co. and Tan Liuan and Uy Tengpiao, for the full amount of the notes, from which the plaintiff should only receive a sufficient amount to fully compensate him as an indorser of the draft; to wit, P46,135.70, and that, if collected the remainder, if any, should be paid to Aw Yong Chiow Soo against whom judgment was rendered for the amount of P46,135.70 should the defendant Tan Liuan & Co. fail to pay the judgment. From this, the defendant Aw Yong Chiow Soo only appealed, claiming that the lower court erred in rendering judgment against it upon the four promissory notes, or that it was liable for the payment of either of them, or that it should pay the plaintiff P46,135.70, or that he should have any judgment against this defendant.

      "STATEMENT The plaintiff is a duly licensed domestic corporation with its principal office and place of business in the city of Manila and engaged in the manufacture and export of cigars made of tobacco grown in the Philippine Islands. The defendant, Vicente Aldanese, is the Insular collector of Customs, and the defendant, W. Trinidad, is the Collector of Internal Revenue of the Philippine Islands. As grounds for its petition, plaintiff alleges that, under the law of Congress of October 3, 1913, known as the Tariff Act, it had the legal right to export from the Philippine Islands into the United States cigars which it manufactured from tobacco grown in the Philippine Islands, quoting paragraph C of section 4, and paragraph F of subsection 1 of the Act. That one February 4, 1916, the Philippine Legislature enacted Law NO. 2613 entitled \"An Act to improve the methods of production and the quality of tobacco in the Philippine and to develop the export trade therein,\" quoting sections 6, 7, and 11 of the Act. It is then alleged that on March 1, 1918, the Collector of Internal Revenue promulgated Administrative Order No. 35, known as \"Tobacco Inspection Regulations.\" quoting section 9. The petition then quotes sections 1 and 8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and section 10 of the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916, known as \"The Jones Law,\" which provides as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"That while this Act provides that the Philippine Government shall have the authority to enact a Tariff Law the trade relations between the Islands and the United States shall continue to be governed exclusively by laws of the Congress of the United States.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It is also alleged \"that large quantities of tobacco are grown in the provinces of La Union, Pangasinan, and other provinces of the Philippine Islands which are manufactured by the petitioner and by other cigar factories of the Philippines into wholesome and sanitary long filler and short filler cigars, and that machine made short filler cigars of sanitary, wholesome and excellent quality are manufactured by petitioner from of tobacco grown in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, La Union, and Pangasinan.\" cralaw virtua1aw library It is further alleged that so much of clause B of section 6 of Act No. 2613 as empowers the Collector of Internal Revenue to establish rules defining the standard and the type of leaf and manufactured tobacco which may be exported into the United States, and portion of section 7 of said Act which provides: \"No leaf tobacco or manufactured tobacco shall be exported from the Philippine Islands to the United States until it shall have been in inspected by the Collector of Internal Revenue, etc.,\" and all that portion of section 11 of the Act, which requires the certificate of origin of the Collector of Internal Revenue to show that the tobacco to be exported is standard, and that portion of section 9 of Administrative Order No. 35, which limits the exportation into the United States of Philippine cigars to those manufactured from long filler tobacco exclusively the product of the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, or Nueva Vizcaya, are unconstitutional and void, for six different specified reasons. It is further alleged that, after the elimination of such provisions, Act No. 2613 specially enjoins it as a duty devolving upon the Internal Revenue Collector to certify to the Insular Collector that any tobacco or cigars offered for export to the United States, which comply with the Act of Congress of October 3, 1913, and the growth and product of the Philippine Islands, to issue a certificate of origin which will insure the speedy admission of such cigars into the United States free of customs duty, and to permit the exportation to the United States of all cigars manufactured of material and tobacco, 80 per cent or more of which is the growth and product of the Philippine Islands. That on February 6, 1922, the petitioner applied to the Collector of Internal Revenue for such a certificate to the Insular Collector of Internal Revenue for such a certificate to the insular collector of customs for a consignment of 10,00 cigars manufactured by it from tobacco grown and produced in the Philippine Islands, which was then and there offered for export to the United States, and was submitted for inspection and the issuance of the proper certificate of origin. That the consignment was packed and stamped as required by the regulations contained in Administrative Order No. 35, and in all things and respects complied with the requirements of the Act of Congress of October 3, 1913, and with the Act NO. 2613 of the Philippine Legislature, after the elimination of the void portions of Act No. 2613 and of the Administrative Order. That the Collector of Internal Revenue wrongfully and unlawfully refused to issue such certificate of origin \"on the ground that said cigars were not manufactured of long filler tobacco produced exclusively in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela or Nueva Vizcaya.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That, notwithstanding such refusal, about February 24, 1922, the petitioner applied to the Insular Collector of Customs for the certificate of origin, and that officer wrongfully and unlawfully refused to issue such certificate \"on the ground that the petitioner had not obtained and presented with the application the certificate of the said respondent Collector of Internal Revenue.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That, by reason of such refusal, the petitioner was deprived of the right of exporting the cigars to the United States. That the petitioner has no \"other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,\" and prays for a peremptory writ of mandamus. An order to show cause was made by this court, and on March 4, the Manila Tobacco Association, through its attorneys, applied for, and was granted, leave to appear as amicus curiae. February 6, a demurrer was filed \"on the ground that the facts stated in the said petition do not entitle the petitioner to the relief demanded, in that — \"1. Act No. 2613 and the executive regulations issued in accordance therewith do not contravene any provision of the fundamental law of the Philippine Islands; \"2. It does not appear from the facts stated in the said petition that the respondents unlawfully neglected the performance of an act specially enjoined upon them by law as a duty, or unlawfully exclude the petitioner from the use and enjoyment of a right granted by law.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The case was argued in banc on March 9, 1922. The defendants [respondents] contend that the portions of Act. NO. 2613 in question are not in violation of any constitutional right or any act of Congress; that the Philippine Legislature is empowered to enact what is known as \"inspection laws;\" and that they are not in conflict with \"inspection laws;\" and that they are not in conflict with paragraph 2, section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of United States, which provides: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the net produce of all duties and imposts, laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress.\" And also that under its police power, the Legislature has authority to enact such a law, and that it was enacted in the interest of the public welfare and to promote an important industry, and that it was not a delegation of legislative power.

      "STATEMENT This is a petition for a writ of prohibition, in which the plaintiffs allege that they are citizens and inhabitants of the Philippine Islands, residing in the city of Manila. The defendant Ramon Fernandez is the Mayor, the defendant Torres, the fiscal, and the defendant Green, the chief of police of the city of Manila. It is alleged that the Plaintiffs are Chiropractic Doctors, practicing their profession in the city of Manila, and that they are graduates of reputable American universities, and have complied with all of the rules and regulations of such universities, which are required for the issuance of the degree of Doctor of Chiropractics, and that a chiropractor is a mechanic whose duty it is to see that human anatomy is in working order, without the use of any king of drugs or medicines internally or externally. That such treatment is practical and economical, and is not dangerous, and that it is officially recognized in a large number of States in the United States, and that as a science it has earned a place among the learned professions and in the Philippine Islands. \"That the plaintiffs are exercising the profession of Chiropractics after having duly paid the license fee required by Internal Revenue Law.\" That the plaintiff, Dimayuga, appeared before the Honorable Secretary of the Interior, the Honorable Director of Health and the Board of Medical Examiners, for the purpose of submitting to, and taking, an examination, if any was required. That he was advised that he could practice his profession so long as there is no express provision against it. That the Board of Medical Examiners informed plaintiff that it could not give him any examination, because no one of its members had any knowledge of chiropractics. That the Director of Health held that he did not have any objection to the plaintiff’s practicing chiropractics in the Philippine Islands so long as there is no complaint against his treatment. \"That there is no law prohibiting directly or indirectly or regulating in any manner the practice of chiropractics in the Philippine Islands.\" That the defendants, with full knowledge of such facts, and in flagrant violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs, are, with the use of force, about to arrest and persecute them in the exercise of their profession in the city of Manila, and to illegally prohibit their practice, as evidenced by a written opinion of Mr. Torres, as fiscal of the city of Manila, and that their arrest would be without any legal right or authority.

      "STATEMENT In May, 1919, Dy Poco, a merchant of Manila, owned the defendant Philippine National Bank about P58,000. Prior to June 4, the bank secured his signature to a blank form of pledge of all of his stock of goods, wares, and merchandise, and a promissory note for the amount of its claim. When the promissory note and the blank form of pledge was signed, neither of them was dated, and there was no list or description of the property pledge, and the bank did not then know the exact amount of its claim against Dy Poco. The note was later dated June 4, 1919, and the bank, relying upon its provisions, seized all of Dy Poco’s property in his bodega at 346 Calle Elcano, of which it made an inventory and made it a part of the pledge, which was given to secure its promissory note. On June 7, the creditors of Dy Poco filed a petition in the Court of First Instance, asking that he be declared insolvent, and, based upon which, he was declared insolvent, and the plaintiff, Frank B. Ingersoll, was duly appointed and qualified as assignee of his estate. On behalf of the creditors, he made upon the bank for the possession of the property described in the pledge or its value alleged to be P75,176.90. Upon refusal of the bank to deliver the property or account for its value , the plaintiff brought this action, among other things, alleging that about June 5, 1919, the bank, without the consent of Dy Poco, seized the merchandise described in the pledge and converted it to its own use; that its value was P77,411.32; that a written demand was made; and he prayed judgment for the amount, with interest and costs. For answer, the bank pleads the execution of the note as of June 4, 1919, and all of its terms and conditions, to which a description of all the property is attached and made a part of the pledge, and that, by reason of a breach of the terms and condition of the note, it took possession of the property and sold and converted it into money, from which it realized P37,382.46, and that it had a legal right to do so. As a special defense to this answer, the plaintiff alleges that the note and pledge was not executed on June 4,  1919, and that the property therein described was never pledged or deposited with the defendant, and that the pledge is not a public instrument, and is void as against the plaintiff. In its bill of intervention, the Philippine Guaranty Company alleges that, on behalf of Dy Poco and on April 22, 1919, it gave a bond to the Government of the Philippine Islands for P19,800 for the presentation to the Collector of Customs, within four months, of the bill of lading for 1,000 boxes of sardines in can, which arrived on the steamship Eclipse at the port of Manila, and on the same date it gave another like bond for P5,700 for the presentation of the certificate of origin of the 1,000 boxes of sardines in the office of the customs house, when required. That the bonds were given by the intervenor, in order that the Collector of Customs would permit Dy Poco, who is now insolvent, to take from the customs house the 1, 000 boxes or sardines which arrived on the steamship Eclipse, without the presentation of the bill of lading or the payment of customs duties; that, by reason of said bonds, the customs authorities permitted Dy Poco to take the sardines from its office; That were seized by the defendant bank and sold for P4,338.60; and that they were of the real value of P10,296; and that the bank has no right to the possession of the merchandise or the proceeds of its sale. That neither the bill of lading nor the certificate of origin of the sardines were delivered by Dy Poco or his assignee to the Bureau of Customs. That, by reason of the failure of the intervenor to deliver the documents, the Collector of Customs will compel the intervenor to pay the damages caused by Dy Poco taking the merchandise from the customs house, and that, under the terms of its bonds, the intervenor is bound to pay the Government of the Philippine Islands the amount of P25,500, which Dy Poco should pay. That the intervenor should be subjugated to the rights of the Government, and that, by reason of such subjugation, the sardines or the proceeds thereof should be delivered to the intervenor. Wherefore, it prayed judgment against the bank for the sum of P4,338.60, with legal interest. After formal denial of this plea, testimony was taken, and the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant bank for P37,382.46, without interest, and directed that P4,338.60 out of such judgment should be paid to the intervenor as a preferred claim, from which all the parties appealed, claiming that the court committed error in accord with their respective contentions.

      "STATEMENT The defendant Carpender had a Government license for the cutting and removal of 20,000 cubic meters of timber in Baganian Peninsula on the southern coast of Mindanao. For the purpose of manufacturing it into lumber and converting it into money, and on the 2d day of June, 1920, Carpender entered into a written contract with the plaintiff, which, among others things, provide that Carpender would finance the proposition and should dispose of the lumber. That the plaintiff should \"devote his entire time and energy in furthering the mutual interests of both parties, exclusively on the cutting license of said party of the first part.\" That he should \"furnish a weekly report to said party of the first part of all expenses and of the amount of work accomplished.\" That he should be responsible for all the machinery and supplies, and should account for them. That he should have a salary of P500 per month, \"and 10 per cent of the net profits accruing from the sale of products handled by said party of the second part, etc.\" The agreement was to continue in force to December 31, 1921, and provided that, in case of a renewal of the cutting license, the contract would automatically be extended for two years. Further, that \"the party of the first part may remove the party of the second part for lawful cause, or drunkenness, inefficiency or negligence, and terminate this agreement.\" The contract was signed by both parties in Manila, and the plaintiff left at once for the premises, with a view of cutting the timber into logs, preparing a mill site and making all the preparations for the manufacture of the timber into lumber upon the arrival of the machinery, and employing the necessary labor for such purpose. Carpender remained in Manila, purchased a saw mill and a tractor for logging purposes, and negotiated for a small electric light plant, so that the mill when installed could be operated twenty-four hours per day. The plaintiff made reports for the first two weeks after his arrival, and failed to make any further reports, and, as a matter of fact, did but very little, if anything, by way of preparation to carry out the spirit and intent of the contract. Meanwhile, the defendant, assuming that the plaintiff was acting in good faith, made all of the necessary preparations to carry out his part of the contract, and advanced money and incurred liabilities to the extent of several thousand pesos. July 12, 1920, Carpender wrote the plaintiff: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"As soon as you start in logging, let me know what results you get with the tractor,\" and on July 18, he wired the plaintiff: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Are you working? Rush reply.\" cralaw virtua1aw library July 23: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"It is all a matter of logs and until I know just what you can do in getting them out with the present equipment, it is very hard for me to decide on this electric light plant.\" cralaw virtua1aw library August 2, defendant telegraphed plaintiff: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Are you logging — wire reply.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The answer to this last telegram was the first information for a month which Carpender had received from the plaintiff, and was the first intimation that he received that the plaintiff was loafing on the job and had done but very little, if anything. Carpender on receipt of an answer to this last wire, went to the timber land and promptly discharged plaintiff, who later commenced this action to recover from him and Punta Flecha Lumber Company P12,000 as damages for a breach of the contract. Meanwhile Carpender had organized this company with a capital stock of P100,000, and assigned his interests, and for such reason the company was made a party. For answer, defendants plead the terms and provisions of the contract, and alleged that the plaintiff \"was inefficient and negligent, and failed and refused to comply with his duties under the terms of said contract.\" \"That plaintiff failed and refused to devote his entire time and energy in furthering the interests of said defendant, and repeatedly and for long periods of time absented himself from defendant’s cutting license where his work was situated, all in violation of the terms of said contract.\" \"That plaintiff failed and refused to furnish defendant with a weekly report of his expenses and of the amount of work accomplished.\" That he failed and refused to obey the orders and instructions of the defendant. After the testimony was taken, the lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for P612.81, the amount due him at the time of his discharge, and the further sum of P8,216.58, as damages, from which the defendant appealed, claiming that the court erred in finding that plaintiff was excused from rendering weekly reports, and that he had devoted all of his time and energy to the interest of his employer, and that his discharge was wrongful, and that he was entitled to recover the wages he would have earned during the full period of the contract, and in overruling defendant’s motion for a new trial.

      "STATEMENT The parties are all residents of Manila. On January 1, 1911, John R. Edgar was engaged in the book and stationery business at No. 143 Escolta, under the firm name of John R. Edgar & Company. E. C. McCullough was then engaged in the same business nearby on Plaza Goiti. At that time Edgar’s assets were about P44,000 and his liabilities about P40,000. It is claimed that in January and February, 1911, the defendant, McCullough, by unfair and improper means, attempted to drive Edgar out of business, and to that end purchased claims against him upon which he threatened judicial proceedings, and to have him declared insolvent. That after various meetings with his creditors, Edgar agreed with them to organize the corporation to John R. Edgar & Company, to which he was to sell and transfer all his assets, in consideration of which the company should assume and agree to pay all of his debts and liabilities, for which the creditors were to have stock corresponding to the amount of their claims. That, among other things, all parties agreed that neither of them was to sell or dispose of his stock until the indebtedness, which was assumed, had been fully paid. That about six months after the corporation was organized, and by mutual agreement among themselves, and in violation of the contract and article 6 of the By-Laws of the company: \"No stockholder shall at any time hold or vote more than 49 per cent of the outstanding stock of the company.\" the other defendants conspired with McCullough, and over the protest of the plaintiffs, sold and transferred unto him the full amount of their capital stock, by which he became the owner and holder of more than 49 per cent. That at such time McCullough was a competitor and business rival of John R. Edgar & Company. That thereafter the said McCullough did unlawfully usurp the control and management of John R. Edgar & Company, and that, as a result of his management, the Edgar Company became financially embarrassed, and was thrown into the hands of a receiver, by whom its affairs were finally liquidated, and only a small percentage of its indebtedness was paid. That, as a result, the plaintiffs, who were stockholders in John R. Edgar & Company, lost the full amount of their respective holdings of more than P11,000, which they now seek to recover from defendants upon the ground of an alleged conspiracy to wreck the John R. Edgar & Company for the use and benefit of McCullough. The answer is in the nature of a general denial of any liability or the violation of the contract. After the taking of testimony, the lower court rendered an opinion in which all of the material facts are fully stated, and entered judgment for the defendants, from which plaintiffs appealed, assigning eleven different errors, all of which relate to the weight and value of the evidence upon which the court based its findings.

      "STATEMENT This is a petition to review an order of the defendants requiring the plaintiff, as a common carrier, to charge a freight rate on rice by weight only. It is alleged that the plaintiff is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands, composed of numerous persons and entities, each of whom is engaged in the business of common carrier, of freight and passengers, in the coastwise trade of the Islands. That it is organized for mutual protection of its associated members and the development of domestic and foreign maritime commerce. That on October 26, 1912, the Board of Rate Regulation promulgated an order, known as No. 16, establishing rates, rules, and regulations for the transportation of freight and passengers in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands. That the order provided that, unless otherwise specified, common carriers in applying such rates should use the unit, whether of weight or volume, which would produce the largest tariff. That, under the provisions of such order, carriers are required to charge freight on rice by measurement. That on September 13, 1918, the Public Utility COMMISSIONER made an order requiring plaintiff to charge freight on rice by measurement in accordance with law. That in January, 1919, the Director of Commerce and Industry duly presented to the Public Utility Commissioner an application seeking to have Order No. 16 amended by providing that the tariff rate on rice should be weighted instead of by measurement, which would bring about a considerable reduction in the rate. That on November 15, 1921, after a hearing, the Public Utility Commissioner amended Order No. 16, reducing the freight rate on rice and requiring carriers to charge by weight only. That on November 29, 1921, the plaintiff petitioned the Commissioner for a rehearing and stay of this decision pending the hearing. The Commissioner ordered a rehearing, but refused to grant the stay. That a rehearing was duly had, and on the 5th of December, 1921, the respondent Board entered an order, affirming the decision of the Public Utility Commissioner. It is then alleged that plaintiff is dissatisfied with the decision of the Board, for the following reasons: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library (a)\tThat there was no evidence before the respondent Board to support reasonably said decision. (b)\tThat the reduction is unreasonable and disastrous. (c)\tThat the reduction means a loss of thirty-nine per cent (39%) on existing freight rates on rice, rendering the rate unremunerative and confiscatory. (d)\tThat the order so confirmed by the respondent Board is prejudicial to public interests. Wherefore, petitioner prays that the record and all proceedings of the Board be certified to this court, and that, upon the hearing and consideration thereof, the decision of the Board be annulled and set aside. Pending further proceedings, this court made an order, requiring all proceedings of the Board be certified, and, pending the hearing, granted a temporary injunction, restraining the enforcement of the decision of the defendants. On January 4, 1922, the defendants, through the Attorney-General, filed an answer in which they deny the alleged grounds for the petition marked (a), (b), (c), and (d) above quoted, and pray for an order sustaining the decision of the defendants.

Paragraph 4 of the petition contains certain subdivisions of section 6 of Act No. 2613 of the Philippine Legislature, passed February 4, 1916, entitled \"An act to improve the methods of production and the quality of tobacco in the Philippines and to develop the export trade therein.\" They empower the Collector of Internal Revenue to establish certain general and local rules respecting the classification, marking and packing of tobacco for domestic sale or for exportation to the United States, and, among other things, provide: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"No leaf tobacco or manufactured tobacco shall be exported from the Philippine Islands to the United States until it shall have been inspected by the Collector of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative and found to be standard for export . . . \"In order to facilitate the free entry of tobacco products from the Philippine Islands into the United States, the Collector of Internal Revenue is authorized to act as stamp agent for the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and to certify to the Insular Collector of Customs that the standard tobacco exported is the growth and product of the Philippine Islands.

Paragraph 6 of the answer says: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"They admit the facts alleged in Paragraph XI of the petition in so far as they refer to the Insular Collector of Customs, but they deny that the acts performed by the said officer are wrongful or illegal; and they also deny the other facts alleged in the same paragraph except as they may hereinafter be impliedly admitted, that is, that on or about February 6, 1922, the petitioner applied to the Collector of Internal Revenue for a certificate of origin covering a consignment of 10,000 machine-made cigars to San Francisco, and as the petitioner himself stated on making such application that the cigars sought to be exported must have been manufactured from short-filler tobacco which was not the product of the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Nueva Vizcaya, the Collector of Internal Revenue did not deem it necessary to make an actual examination and inspection of said cigars and state to the petitioner that he did not see his way clear to the granting of petitioner’s request, in view of the fact that the cigars which the petitioner was seeking to export were not made with long-filler nor were they made from tobacco exclusively the product of any of the three mentioned provinces, and the said cigars were neither nor examined by the Collector of Internal Revenue.\" cralaw virtua1aw library As a special defense, the respondents allege that under section 11 of Act No. 2613 and section 5 of the Administrative Code of 1917, the Collector of Internal Revenue has discretionary power to decide whether the manufactured tobacco that the petitioner seeks to export to the United States fulfills the requisites prescribed by Administrative Order No. 35. That it is not within the jurisdiction of this court to order the Collector of Internal Revenue to issue a certificate to the petitioner to the effect that the manufactured tobacco that the petitioner seeks to export is a product of the Philippine Islands, but it is for the Collector of Internal Revenue to exercise the power of issuing said certificate if after an inspection of said tobacco, he should find that \"it conforms to the conditions required by Administrative Order No. 35 with the exclusion of those conditions which, according to the said decision of the Supreme Court, the Collector of Internal Revenue is not authorized to require under Act No. 2613.\" cralaw virtua1aw library \"That the cigars which petitioner seeks to export to the United States have not as yet been examined or inspected by the Collector of Internal Revenue.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Wherefore, the defendants pray that the petition be dismissed, with costs.

      "STATEMENT January 12,1916, D.P. Dunn was the sole owner of a certain business, known as the \"Non-Commissioned Officers’ Club\" at Stotsenburg in the Province of Pampanga, and the building, fixture, furniture, and dynamo used in connection therewith, and executed to the defendant a mortgage thereon for P9,000 to secure an existing debt, and, among other things, the mortgage recites that until such time as the debt was paid Dunn would keep the property \"insured against loss by fire in such companies as the Brewery may designate, for their full insurable value, and will indorse the insurance policies to the Brewery so that the latter may be authorized to received the insurance money in the event of loss and retain such part thereof as may be necessary to satisfy any indebtedness still existing.\" cralaw virtua1aw library At the time of the execution of the mortgage, and in compliance with its terms, at the request and with the approval of the defendant, Dunn authorized and instructed it to insure the property at its full estimated value of P15,000, with loss, if any, payable to the defendant, as its interest may appear, and the remainder to him. It is claimed that, notwithstanding such agreement and instructions, the defendant took out the policies of insurance in its own name for P15,000 with a provision that the loss, if any, should be payable to the defendant only, as its interest may appear, without any insurance in favor of Dunn for his remaining interest. That at the request of the defendant, he paid premiums on an insured value of P15,000, and that it represented to him that, by the terms of the policies, in the event of loss by fire, it would collect and retain the amount of its mortgage debt, and pay the remainder of the loss to Dunn. May 27, 1917, with the consent and approval of the defendant, and subject to the terms and condition of the mortgage, Dunn sold the property to the plaintiff, who thereby acquired all interest of Dunn and became subjugated to all his right, including the policies of insurance. That plaintiff never saw the policies which were at all times in the possession of the defendant, and claims that he accepted and relied on the statements and representations of the of the property was insured for the full value of P15,000, and in such a manner that, in the event of loss by fire, the plaintiff’s interests were fully protected. After the execution of the tripartite agreement, and on June 20,1917, the property was totally destroyed by fire, and meanwhile, through payments which had been made on the mortgage debt to the defendant from time to time by the plaintiff and Dunn, its claim was reduced from P9,000 to P3,600. That after the fire, and relying upon the express terms of the policies, the insurance companies denied any liability over and above the amount then due and vowing the defendant on its mortgage debt, which was then P3,000, and refused to pay any more. An action was brought by the defendant on the policies against the insurance companies to recover the full amount of P15,000, which resulted in a final decision of this court that under the terms of the policies, the insurance companies were only liable for P3,600. 1 The plaintiff then commenced this action against the defendant to recover from it P11,400, the difference between P3,600 and P15,000, claiming and alleging that he was misled and deceived, through the fault and negligence of the defendant, as to the true terms and conditions of the insurance policies, and that, by reason thereof, the defendant should pay him P11,400 with interest. In substance, for answer, the defendant admits the execution of the mortgage and the insurance of the property, and, as a further and separate defense, alleges that on October 8, 1917, it commenced a civil against the insurance companies to recover upon the policies P15,000, in which Harding, the plaintiff, filed an answer, a copy of which is attached to its plea in this action, and that in such action the plaintiff here, as defendant there, failed and omitted \"to set up by counterclaim the alleged rights which he now seeks to assert in this cause of action,\" and that he is now estopped. As a further defense, the company alleges that Dunn \"ratified and confirmed the action of this defendant in taking out policies of insurance on the property described in paragraph three of said complaint in the form and manner alleged in paragraph six thereof.\" That, thereafter, the plaintiff also ratified the defendant’s action, and that, when plaintiff purchased Dunn’s interest, he did not \"acquire any right to have said property insured by this defendant, or any right of action against this defendant because of the form and manner in which said insurance had theretofore been taken out.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, as prayed for in his complaint from which defendant appeals, assigning seven different errors in substance that the court erred in rendering judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in his complaint, and in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

After that opinion was rendered, B. E. Johannes, as principal administrator of the estate of Carmen Theodora Johannes, applied to his Honor Carlos A.

Ranola, a councilman of the municipality of Lukban, province of Tayabas, Philippine Islands, and to maliciously expose him to odium, contempt, and ridicule, wrote an article in the municipality of Lukban, and caused the publication and circulation thereof in the said municipality and other municipalities of the province on page 2 in the Ang Bansa, a newspaper in the City of Manila, and with general circulation in the municipality of Lukban and the and the province of Tayabas, which article was false, injurious, and a malicious libel. After four witnesses for the prosecution had testified, it appeared that the article was actually written by the defendant in Manila, for which reason the defense moved for the dismissal of the case, and the motion was granted, from which decision the prosecuting attorney appealed to this court. The fiscal filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the defendant was placed in jeopardy and acquitted, and that an appeal will not lie. JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT The plaintiff was a merchant engaged in the purchase and sale of bolt goods in the city of Manila, with his place of business in a bodega at 926-930 Calle Jaboneros, which he occupied in common with the Eastern Asia Commercial Company. The building was constructed of stone with an upper framework of wood and an iron roof. The defendants are fire insurance companies duly licensed to do business in the Philippine Islands. On March 31, 1919, the Northern Assurance Company, for a premium of P250, issued its policy against loss from fire for the period of one year to and in favor of the plaintiff for P10,000 on his stock of piece goods in the bodega, subject to certain terms and provisions therein stated. On the same day and for a like premium, the Commercial Assurance Company, Limited, issued its policy on the same property for the same period for P10,000. April 7, 1919, the Yorkshire Insurance Company issued its policy on the same goods for another P10,000 for the same period. April 14, 1919, the Scottish Union and National Insurance Company also issued its policy to him on the same goods for P10,000 for the period of one year. June 24, 1919, about 4:40 a. m., while all of the policies were in force and effect, a fire occurred in that portion of the building occupied by the Eastern Asia Commercial Company, resulting in a loss and damage to the plaintiff’s goods, which were insured. At the time of the fire, he claims that he was the owner of 66 case of bolt goods in the bodega, and that there was a total loss of 50 cases, and that the remaining 16 were totally damaged. After making proof of his claims and the failure to agree with the insurance companies after some negotiations as to the amount of his loss, the plaintiff commenced this action against the Yorkshire Insurance Company and the Scottish Union and National Insurance Company, in which he seeks to recover from each of them the full amount of their respective policies. For answer, the companies admit the issuance of the policies and that they were in force and effect, but contend that not more than 16 cases of plaintiff’s goods were destroyed from which he received P6,888, the amount of their salvage value, and, in substance, admit their liability for the difference between the actual value of the 16 cases and their salvage value. As a further and separate defense, they allege that plaintiff submitted fraudulent proof of the amount of his loss, and that, for such reason, he is not entitled to recover anything. They also contend that the plaintiff violated the express terms of the policies in keeping his goods in the same building where hemp was stored. As a result of the trial, the lower court rendered judgment against each defendant for P8,373.10, from which both appeal, assigning eight different errors, the first four of which go to the weight of the evidence. Fifth, that the court should have found that plaintiff made a fraudulent claim. Sixth, that the court erred in not finding that the policies were violated by the storing of plaintiff’s goods in the same building where hemp was stored. Seventh, that the policies should have been forfeited, because of the storage of gasoline in violation of their terms, and, eighth, in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. JOHNS, J. :\n",

June, 1918, what is known in the record as the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., was organized by the agriculturists in the provinces of Occidental Negros and Iloilo, with a capital stock of P10,000. Its primary purpose was to foster the manufacture and refinement of centrifugal sugar and its by-products. Only P2,500 of the capital stock was paid, and, for a long time, little, if anything, was done. In 1920 its corporate interests were acquired by Phil. C. Whitaker and the defendant, who reorganized the company with a capital stock of P500,000 divided into 5,000 shares of the par value of P100 each, out of which Whitaker was issued a certificate for 1,865 shares and the defendant 1,615 shares, and the firm of Puno, Concepcion & Co. a certificate for 250 shares, and the remainder to other and different persons. In the month of November, 1920, the capital stock was increased to P1,500,000 and 6,053 shares of stock were issued to the defendant, portions of which he transferred to other persons, among whom were his immediate relatives. Notwithstanding the fact that the original capital stock was for P10,000, and that it was increased to P500,000 and again to P1,500,000, there is no registered document in the Bureau of Commerce and Industry in either case showing the increase of the capital stock of the estate. January 30, 1920, Whitaker, Luzuriaga, and the defendant entered into an agreement as partners to acquire and operate what is known as the \"Palma\" sugar central and hacienda in the municipality of Ilog, Occidental Negros, a short distance from the property of the Binalbagan Estate. Under this agreement, Whitaker and the defendant were to each have 40 per cent and Luzuriaga 20 per cent. Concurrent therewith, the three entered into another agreement with Salvador Serra for the sale and purchase of his business known as central and hacienda \"Palma\" at an agreed price of P1,500,000, P150,000 of which was to be paid on or before June 30, 1920, when the property was to be actually conveyed, and to assume a mortgage on the property for P600,000, the remainder to be paid in three installments of P250,000 each, respectively, on or before June 30, 1921, 1922, and 1923. January 29, 1920, this contract was duly signed by all of the respective parties, and was duly witnessed and acknowledged before a notary public. On January 10, 1919, Salvador Serra executed a mortgage upon all of this property in favor of the Philippine National Bank for P600,000, which was then owned and held by the bank, and in full force and effect. On July 17, 1920, in the office of the Philippine National Bank and in the presence of the defendant and Whitaker, and in accord with the terms and provisions of the instrument of January 29, 1920, Salvador Serra made, executed and delivered a deed of conveyance of the property described in the contract of January 29, 1920, and at the same time and place, and as a part of the transaction, Whitaker delivered to Salvador Serra the check of the Binalbagan Estate drawn upon the Philippine National Bank for P750,000, which was honored and paid by the bank, and out of which it satisfied the mortgage, which it then held on the \"Palma\" hacienda, for P600,000 with accrued interest amounting to P26,218.66, and gave Salvador Serra credit in his current account in its branch at Iloilo for P123,781.34, making a total of P750,000, which the defendant and his associates had agreed to pay under the contract of January 29, 1920, thus consummating the deal. On July 17, 1920, the Binalbagan Estate was indebted to the Philippine National Bank more than P3,000,000, and did not have the money with which to pay the check of P750,000. To provide the necessary funds, it executed its promissory note payable on sight for that amount to the Philippine National Bank, which was presented to Vicente Gaskell, then in charge of loans and discounts, who in turn presented the note to the defendant for his approval, and the defendant then and there approved the loan to the estate, and initialed the note \"V. C.,\" which was his customary and usual method of approving loans, and after the defendant approved the loan, the check of the Binalbagan Estate for P750,000 was honored by the bank, and the account of the Binalbagan Estate was then credited with the amount of P750,000. In his weekly report of July 22, it appears that Gaskell made a report of the P750,000 loan to the Binalbagan estate, but that no specific mention was made of the loan by the defendant in his report, and that no record of the loan was made in the corporate minutes of the Board of Directors as of July 23, 1920. By the provisions of Act No. 2938, the capital stock of the bank was increased from P20,000,000 to P50,000,000. Following an investigation, an information was filed in the Court of First Instance against the defendant, which was later amended, charging him, as President of the Bank, with a violation of the provisions of section 35 as it relates to section 49 of Act No. 2747 of the Philippine Legislature above quoted. In substance, and to the effect that, through the commission of such acts and in the making of the loan of P750,000 to the Binalbagan Estate, the defendant was guilty of a violation of section 35, and should be punished under section 49, of Act No. 2747. Upon this charge, he was arraigned, tried, convicted and sentenced to two years of imprisonment and to pay a fine of P5,000 and costs, from which the defendant appeals and assigns the following errors: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I. The trial court erred in overruling the demurrer interposed by the defense on the ground that the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute a violation of Act No. 2747. II. The trial court likewise erred in overruling the motion for dismissal, interposed by the defense, on the ground that the prosecution has not proved the essential facts alleged in the complaint. III. The trial court likewise erred in not ordering the striking out of the hearsay testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, notwithstanding the petition of the defense, as well as in permitting the fiscal to ask leading questions on incompetent, immaterial and irrelevant facts, to the witnesses for the prosecution, and the latter to answer said questions which were objected to by the defense. IV. The court likewise erred in admitting as proof Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, F-1, G, H, K, L, P, V-15, X, Y, Y-1, AA, BB, CC, DD, FF, GG, GG-1, HH, HH-1, to HH-12, JJ. , JJ-1, and JJ-2 of the prosecution, notwithstanding that they were objected to by the defense as being incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, for they are not the best proof and not having been duly authenticated. V. The trial court likewise erred in declaring that about the first months of the year, 1920, a great portion of the interests of the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., was acquired by Phil. C. Whitaker and the accused, V. Concepcion. VI. The lower court likewise erred in declaring that the firm of Puno, Concepcion & Co., Ltd., is exclusively composed of the accused and the members of his family. VII. The lower court also erred in declaring that the writing executed on January 29, 1920, by Salvador Serra, the owner of the hacienda and the central \"Palma\" in favor of Whitaker, Concepcion, and Luzuriaga was an option and not a purchase and sale. VIII. The lower court likewise erred in declaring that at the time in which the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., drew the check for P750,000 in favor of Salvador Serra, the same had obtained from the National Bank, under the signature and authorization of its president, the accused herein, several credits, overdrafts and loans, which amounted to several millions of pesos. IX. The lower court likewise erred in declaring that the limit of the credit allowed by the National Bank to the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., in the week which terminated on the 22nd of July, 1920, was P3,660,000. X. The lower court likewise erred in declaring that the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., had been obtaining credits from the Philippine National Bank for various amounts, against which it was obtaining loans for amounts which at times were included in the total sum of the credit allowed, and at times exceed the limit of said credit. XI. The lower court likewise erred in not declaring that the concession by the Philippine National Bank to the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., of P750,000 on July 17, 1920, has been made with the unanimous consent of the members of the Board of Directors of the bank. XII. The lower court likewise erred in declaring contrary to section 10 of Act No. 2612, as amended by Act No. 2938, that the obligations contracted with the National Bank by virtue of the discount of negotiable papers, bills of exchange, and promissory notes, are loans. XIII. The lower court also erred in declaring that the opinion of the Insular Auditor, the ex-officio Auditor of the Bank, cannot in any manner serve as a standard of conduct for the officers of the bank. XIV. The lower court likewise erred in declaring that the sum of P750,000 given to the Binalbagan Estate, Inc., by the National Bank on July 17, 1920, was a loan granted on said date and not on the date on which the credit contract was perfected. XV. The lower court lastly erred in finding the accused guilty of the violation with which he is charged in the complaint, sentencing him to two years of imprisonment, and to pay a fine of P5,000 and costs of the action.

Ammen Transportation Company was a corporation engaged in operating a line of motor trucks in the provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay for the transportation of freight and passengers, and the defendant was in its employ as the chauffeur of one of its trucks. December 11, 1920, the district engineer met the truck which the defendant was driving on the provincial highway in the municipality of Bato, and found that there were forty-six passengers on it some of whom were riding on the running boards. Under the official rules and regulations, the capacity of the truck was limited to forty persons. The district engineer filed a complaint against the defendant for the violation of Act No. 2587 in the justice of the peace court of Bato upon which he was tried, convicted, and fined P80, from which judgment he appealed to the Court of First Instance where the case was again tried, and the defendant was convicted and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, for the assigned reason that the truck was a public vehicle, from which the defendant appeals to this court, claiming that the trial court erred in holding that the defendant and not the conductor of the auto truck was the person liable; in refusing to receive certain evidence; and in finding the defendant guilty, and that the motor vehicle was a public one; and in the sentence which was passed.

C. Whitaker, at that time president of the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, informed the said accused, Venancio Conception, that it was the intention of the said Whitaker to bid at the auction sale of said six thousand(6,000) shares of the stock of the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company for the purchase of the same for and on behalf of the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company; that the said accused then informed the said Whitaker that he, the said accused, also intended to bid at the auction sale for the said shares; that thereupon it was agreed between the said Whitaker and the said accused that to avoid competitive bidding at the said auction, the said accused would refrain from bidding, and that he would cause a loan to be made to the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company from the funds of the Philippine National Bank of a sum sufficient to pay for the said shares if bid in at said auction sale by the said Whitaker, and the said Whitaker agreed, in consideration of the undertaking of the accused, that if he succeeded in bidding in the said shares for the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, he would cause the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company to sell two hundred (200) of said shares to the accused at cost and lend him the money with which to pay for the same; that pursuant to said agreement the said accused refrained from bidding at the said auction sale, and five thousand eight hundred (5,800) of the said six thousand (6,000) shares of the stock of the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company were, at the said auction sale held in Manila, Philippine Islands, in the said month of April, 1919, sold by the Alien Property Custodian to the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company; that the said accused in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, caused a loan to be made to the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company in the sum of seven hundred and twenty-five thousand pesos (P725,000) Philippine currency, to enable it to pay for the said shares, and the said Whitaker, as president of said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, in consideration of the said loan and of the abstention of the accused from bidding at the said auction sale, caused two hundred (200) of said shares to be issued to the said accused, Venancio Concepcion, and accepted the note of the said accused for the sum of twenty-fife thousand pesos (P25,000) and payable on demand to the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company in consideration thereof; that the said two hundred(200) shares were thereupon duly registered in the book of the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company as the property of the accused; that on the 15th day of July, 1919, he was paid the sum of two thousand pesos (P2,000) as his dividend on such shares; that thereafter, to wit, on or about the 2d day of September, 1919, at Manila, in the Philippine Islands, the accused informed the said Whitaker that he desired to sell the said two hundred (200) shares of the stock of the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, whereupon the said Whitaker, on behalf of the said Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, agreed with the accused to purchase the said shares at an advance of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000) over the price at which they bought by the accused; that on or about the 2d day of September, 1919, in Manila, Philippine Islands, pursuant to said agreement, the said shares were transferred by the accused to the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, and his said note for twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000) was cancelled and returned to him; that on the 2d day of September, 1919, the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company issued and delivered to the accused its check on the bank of the Philippine Islands, to the order of the said accused, for the sum of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000) Philippine currency, which said check was cashed by the said accused and the full amount thereof received by him in payment of the difference between his said note and the increased price at which the said two hundred (200) shares were sold by him to the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company. \"Contrary to law.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Upon the charge, he was tried and convicted of a violation of the provisions of section 17 of Act No. 2747 of the Philippine Legislature, and sentenced to pay a fine of P5,000 and costs, or to suffer a subsidiary imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months. The opinion of the trial court is exhaustive and contains a complete and careful analysis of all the facts shown at the trial. Among other things the court in its opinion says: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"It will be observed from the testimony quoted, that the witness Whitaker did not make any agreement with the accused, except the latter could get number of shares that he may desire at cost price. Absolutely no conversation was had with respect to the money with which the price of the shares that would be sold at auction should be paid; neither was there anything said in that conversation with reference to any loan, and it appears from the testimony of the said witness that he had no knowledge of the manner of acquiring the funds with which to play the 5800 shares. \"From said declarations it can clearly be seen that between the accused and Phil. C. Whitaker there was no stipulation or agreement regarding the loan of P725,000, and there is not the slightest indication that in said conversation it was stipulated, as alleged in the complaint, that said loan was granted by the accused in consideration of the previous understanding between him and Whitaker that the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company would transfer to him at cost price all the shares he may desire. \"Aside from the fact that the theory of the prosecution regarding this point does not agree with the testimony of the witness Whitaker, the only one who could be in a position to declare something the essential allegations contained in the complaint, the other proof of the prosecution indicates that there did not exist any contractual relation between the loan obtained from the Philippine National Bank and the alleged agreement had between the accused and Phil. C. Whitaker. \"It having been demonstrated, as it was, that the evidence of the prosecution has not established the essential allegation contained in the complaint that the accused had taken any part of the shares sold by the Alien Property Custodian, in consideration of the loan of seven hundred and twenty-five thousand pesos by him granted the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company nor of the previous understanding which existed between said accused and Phil. C. Whitaker that the former would abstain from taking part in the sale at public auction of the shares, and that he would grant said loan in exchange of the two hundred of said shares to be given to him, it necessarily follows that the accused cannot be found guilty of having obtained by indirect means a loan from the Philippine National Bank, of which he was president, contrary to section 35 of Act No. 2747. \"We will examine the other contention of the prosecuting officer that the facts established constitute likewise a violation of paragraph 2 and subsection (b) of section 17 of the same Act. \"In examining this other aspect of the case, the first question that presents itself is whether or not the complaint herein filed contains allegations upon which the court may find the accused guilty of said violation, in case such finding is borne out by the evidence. The defense insists that the accused cannot be convicted of said violation because there is not in the complaint any allegation to the effect that the accused granted the loan without authorization of the board of directors of the National Bank, and has, consequently, exceeded or overstepped the powers conferred on him by the aforesaid Act. \"The conclusion must, therefore, be that there being categorical and sufficient allegations in the complaint, to the effect that the accused, being president of the Philippine National Bank, granted the Philippine Vegetable Oil company a loan of seven hundred and twenty-five thousand pesos, which constitutes an overstepping of his only powers defined in paragraph 2 of section 17 of Act No. 2747, the accused can be convicted of said violation, if it is established by the evidence. \"From the facts just related, it is inferred that the accused, and not Vicente Gaskell, as is claimed by the defense, granted the loan of seven hundred and twenty-five thousand pesos to the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company, and that said act constitutes a flagrant violation of paragraph 2 of section 17 of Act No. 2747, which empowers the president of the Philippine National Bank to grant loans only on negotiable instruments for periods of time not exceeding four months, and in amounts which can in no case exceed fifty thousand pesos. \"With reference to the intimation of the prosecuting officer that the accused is likewise guilty, according to the evidence, of a violation of subsection (b) of section 17, the court is of the opinion that, although it was established by the evidence, the accused cannot be convicted of said violation, because it has not been sufficiently alleged in the complaint, nor from the terms in which it is written can it be inferred that the accused was also guilty of said violation; beside the evidence in regard to this point is not sufficiently conclusive and convincing to serve as a basis for a conviction. It may not be amiss to remember, in discussing this point, that the witnesses for the prosecution, who were members of the board of directors of the Philippine National Bank at the time alleged in the complaint, testified in a manner so uncertain and vague that from the whole of their testimonies, it cannot be deduced with relative certainty that the members of the board of directors of said Bank did not really have knowledge of the contents of the report of the department of loans and discounts. \"Summarizing all the foregoing, the court finds: (a) That the accused is not guilty of a violation of section 35, nor of subsection b of section 17 of Act No. 2747, and (b) that the evidence of the prosecution conclusively proves that the accused is guilty of a violation of paragraph 2 of the said section 17, because, overstepping his powers and without authorization from the board of directors of the Philippine National Bank, he granted the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company a loan for the amount of seven hundred and twenty-five thousand pesos, a sum which up to this date has not been reimbursed by the entity indebted.\" cralaw virtua1aw library No demurrer was filed to the information, and no motion was filed to make it make definite and certain. During the trial the prosecution called some of the directors of the Philippine National Bank as witnesses, and this or a similar question we asked: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Q. Please see this document Exhibit B of the prosecution which I show you, and, after having known its contents, I request that you tell the court if, among the various matters which have been discussed by the board of directors of the Bank on that date, May 21, 1919, the concession of any loan of P725,000 or of any other loan of a greater amount to the Philippine Vegetable Oil Company was discussed?\" To which the defendant made the following objection: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Mr. WELCH. We object to the question and to all this line of questions to the directors of the Bank, with respect to what they remember of the meetings of the board of directors, for being irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The objection was overruled, and an exception duly taken, and the directors were permitted to testify in substance, over the objection of the defendant, that they had never authorized the loan, and that it was made without their knowledge or consent. When the prosecution rested its case, the defense filed a motion for an acquittal, which was extensively argued pro and con. Among other things, the Fiscal contended: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"There was a violation of the second paragraph of section 17, and also of subsection b of this same section, in so far as this section 17 speaks of the duties of the president, principally of the duty which the present has to inform the board of directors of the loans which are being granted. Among the other sections, which the prosecution contends that have been violated, is section 25, which says that the National Bank shall not grant loans, directly or indirectly, to any of the members of the board of directors. or to the assessors of the same, etc.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Upon the making of this statement by the fiscal, the attorneys for the defendant asked for the dismissal of the case against him on the ground \"that the prosecuting officer asked for the conviction of the accused, basing the complaint over two sections absolutely different, which cannot be combined in only one complaint.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The court: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"You may proceed, but, as is seen in the complaint, the prosecuting officer has not charged any specific violation of any section of Act No. 2747. The first paragraph of the complaint simply says: The undersigned accuses Venancio Concepcion of violation of some of the provisions of section 17 of Act No. 2717. The question as to what section of the law has been violated by the accused is to be determined by the court rather than by the court rather than by the prosecuting officer. The prosecuting officer may now think and contend that sections 17 and 35 have been violated; the attorneys for the defense could have thought that the allegations of the complaint constitute a violation of section 42, but, in the end, it is the court who must determine, first, whetherï¿½there existed a violation of the law; in the second place, what section has been violated, or, finally, whether no law was violated.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The court later overruled all the motions of the defendant in which it said: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Let there be stated in the record the exception of the attorneys for the defense to the ruling of the court on the motion for dismissal which was presented, and to the resolution in writing dated August 17, 1921.\" cralaw virtua1aw library From the judgment of conviction, the defendant appeals, and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The court erred: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I.

For answer, the defendant makes a specific denial of all of the material allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense, alleges that the White truck described in paragraph two of plaintiff’s second cause of action was voluntarily delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant under instructions to sell it for the best obtainable price. That it was unable to sell the truck, and that on July 1, the truck was returned to the plaintiff who voluntarily received and accepted it. As a cross-complaint and counterclaim, the defendant further alleges the execution of certain chattel mortgages by the plaintiff to the defendant, a breach of the conditions and a sale of the property under the terms of the mortgage, and also the sale of certain goods, wares, and merchandise, making a total amount of all sales and purchases of P39,042.46 upon which at different times and from different sources, the defendant has paid P19,646.26 leaving a balance due and owing the defendant from the plaintiff of P16,187.01, for which it prays judgment against the plaintiff, with costs.

      "STATEMENT For cause of action it is alleged that in the month of February, 1918, plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement by which the defendant was to deliver plaintiff 501 bales of tobacco at New York City in good condition. That delivery was made and the plaintiff paid the full purchase price. That upon an examination later the tobacco had $12,000 less than it would have been if the tobacco had been in the condition which defendant agreed that it should be, as a result of which plaintiff claims damages for $12,000, United States currency, or P24,000, Philippine currency. That when the condition of the tobacco was discovered, plaintiff promptly notified the defendant, who ignored the protest. Wherefore, the plaintiff prays judgment for the amount of P24,000, Philippine currency, for costs and general relief. For answer, the defendant denies all the material allegations of the complaint, and, as a further and separate defense, alleges that on August 15, 1918, he was advised by the plaintiff that the latter was dissatisfied with the quality of the tobacco, and he made him a formal written offer to repurchase the tobacco at the original selling price with. That defendant has been ready and willing at all reasonable times to accept the return of the tobacco and to return the amount of the purchase price with legal interest, and has repeatedly tendered to the plaintiff such purchase price in exchange for the return of the tobacco, and that plaintiff had refused to return it. That any damages which plaintiff may have suffered have been wholly due to his willful refusal to return and redeliver the tobacco. Upon such issues there was a stipulation of facts, and after trial the lower court rendered judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $11,867.98 or P23, 735.96 with legal interest from January 6, 1920, and costs, from which, after his motion for a new trial was overruled, the defendant appeals, claiming that the court erred: First, in finding that the tobacco was not in good condition when it arrived in New York; second, in holding that the plaintiff is entitled to maintain an action for breach of contract after having agreed with the defendant to rescind and to make restitution of the subject matter and the price after a violation of the agreement; third, in holding that the plaintiff, having elected to rescind and notified the defendant of such an election, may now refute it and affirm the same and recover from the alleged breach of warranty; fourth, in holding that this action should be maintained, no claim having been made for the alleged breach of warranty of quality within the statutory period; and, fifth, in overruling the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

In view of this, and the vessel sailing from Manila on Wednesdays, it will reach Iloilo early Friday morning, arriving in Manila early on Monday morning, and it will thereby have three working days here which is necessary in order that the weekly service be rendered efficiently and satisfactorily. \"Praying that you approve this slight change which favors both us and the public in general, and with sincere thanks in advance, we remain, \"Very truly yours.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The petition was treated as a separate case, and on November 16, 1920, the usual order of publication was made for a hearing which was set for December 3, 1920, at 10:30 a. m.

Numerous protests and objections were filed against the granting of the petition, upon which a large amount of evidence was taken and several hearings were had covering a period from December 7, 1920, the Public Utility Commissioner rendered a decision in which the temporary permit was revoked, and it was ordered that the steamship Venus strictly comply with the decision of the Commissioner rendered on October 13, 1920, in case No. 1947. His decision was later affirmed by the Board, from which petitioner appeals to this court, claiming that the respondents erred: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"In holding that the Public Utility Commissioner is empowered by law to control the sailing schedules of ships operating as common carries in the inter-island trade in the manner attempted in this case. \"In ruling that the Compania Maritima has acquired a prior right to Wednesday at each week as a sailing date from Manila and to Saturday of each week as a sailing date from Iloilo. \"In holding that the public convenience would be subserved by denying the petitioner of the Ynchausti Steamship Company to change its sailing days from Tuesday to Wednesday of each week from Manila, and from Friday to Saturday of each from Iloilo.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff alleges that at all times since 1912 she has been and is now the owner of the lease of those certain premises occupied as a cabaret and dancing hall known as \"Lerma Park,\" In the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, and of the business and buildings connected therewith and belonging thereto. Since that time the defendant, as her agent, has had the control and management of the premises and of the business, and that he has collected and expended large sums of money in the operation thereof, the amount of which is unknown to the plaintiff. That he has failed to account to her for the moneys received and collected, and that on April 20, 1921, she made a demand upon him for the possession of the business and property, and that he refused to make delivery. Wherefore, she prays judgment for an accounting to determine the amount due and owing the plaintiff, and that she have the possession of the property and business. For answer, the defendant made a specific denial of all of the matters alleged in the complaint, and, as a separate defense, pleads that the plaintiff is not and never was the owner of the business or the property; that any documents executed tending to show that she had any interest in the property were executed as a matter of convenience only; that in October and November, 1918, the business was in bad condition, and, for such reason, the defendant decided to either sell it or mortgage it, but was unable to do so for the reason that the money lenders suspected that plaintiff might have or claim to have an interest in the property, and at their suggestion he was forced to obtain from the plaintiff a transfer of any right, title or interest which she might have or claim to have in the property, and that he then obtained from her a bill of sale on November 8, 1918, for P25,000, known in the record as Exhibit 23, which is made a part of the answer. That plaintiff never did have any interest in the business and never did have anything to do with its administration or management, and never at any time had possession of it. That on November 8, 1918, he paid the plaintiff the sum of P25,000, as she was leaving the Philippine Islands, in order to induce her to sign Exhibit 23; that upon that date she did leave; that after her return she never claimed or asserted any interest in the property until April 21, 1921. Upon such issues a trial was had, more than six hundred pages of testimony were taken, a large number of exhibits were introduced in evidence, and the lower court rendered an opinion, in substance and to the effect, that the plaintiff was the owner of the business and property known as \"Lerma Park,\" and that within thirty days the defendant should render to her an accounting of his administration of the business as to the income, expenses, profit, and loss, in which should be included all the debits against the plaintiff of the moneys she may have received from the defendant, including the P20,000 paid to her as she was leaving the Philippine Islands. From which the defendant appeals, assigning sixteen different errors, all of which, for the purpose of this opinion, may be included in the contention that the court erred in declaring the plaintiff to be the owner of the business, and in not finding that the defendant at all times had been and is now the sole and absolute owner of the business known as \"Lerma Park.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

That the draft was duly endorsed, and that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of it in due course of business. That demand therefor has been made and payment refused. Wherefore, plaintiff prays for judgment against the defendants for the amount of the draft, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent annum from May 12, 1920, to the date of payment, plus exchange at the rate of 14 per centum with costs. The complaint was filed August 4, 1921. For answer, the defendants deny all of the material allegations of the complaint, except such as are hereinafter admitted, and, as a further and separate defense, specifically deny that are indebted to the plaintiff in the amount alleged or in any other sum, or that the plaintiff is the holder of the draft in due course of business or for value. It is then alleged that on February 25, 1910, the defendants ordered from \"Snow’s, LTD.\" ten cases of mercerized batiste of the value $10,266.98 to be shipped from New York freight prepaid to Manila where they were to be delivered to the defendants. That the merchandise in question arrived in Manila about June 28,1920, at which time a draft for the amount alleged drawn by \"Snow’s, Ltd.\" against the defendants was presented to them through the plaintiff as agent of Snow’s, Ltd.\" for acceptance. That the delivery of the bill of landing and other documents relating to the merchandise was refused by the plaintiff until the draft was accepted by the defendants, and that delivery was contingent upon the acceptance of the draft. That the defendants, being assured by plaintiff, and believing that the merchandise described in the bill of lading was the \"batiste\" ordered, accepted the draft and received delivery of the bill of lading and made entry of the goods at the Customs House in Manila, and paid charges thereon amounting to P628.07; that when the cases supposed to contain the \"batiste\" were opened they were found to contain \"burlap\" of little value, which was not in any sense or manner the \"batiste\" ordered and guaranteed to be contained in the cases. That immediately the defendants declined to receive the goods and left them in the possession of the Customs authorities, and at once notified the plaintiff and returned to it the bill of lading, and demanded that their acceptance of the draft be cancelled. That plaintiff accepted the return of the bill of lading and documents, and agreed to cancel defendants’ acceptance of the draft, for the reason that it was without consideration. Wherefore, defendants pray for judgment, with costs. The lower court found for the defendants for whom judgment was entered, and the plaintiff appeals, claiming that the court erred in failing to make any findings of fact, in dismissing the complaint, and in failing to render judgment for the plaintiff, and in the admission of parol evidence tending to vary the terms of the written acceptance of the bill of exchange, that the plaintiff had cancelled defendants’ acceptance, that defendants were released, and in the admission of certain exhibits, and the denial of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.

      "STATEMENT This is a petition for a writ of certiorari by the municipal council of Masantol, Pampanga, in which it is alleged that the Honorable G. B. Guevara is the Judge of the Court of First Instance of that province; that pending in his court there are different petitions for writs of mandamus against the petitioner here, who is respondent there, all of which were consolidated, to which the petitioner here filed a demurrer upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the defendant or of the subject-matter, and that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; that on October 20, 1922, the demurrer was overruled; that the terms of office of the municipal councilors as constituted on October 9, 1922, expired on October 16, 1922, at which time a new council was inaugurated; that at all times the new council has never convened as a municipal board of election canvassers, and that the new board never took any part in the canvass of the last general election returns; that feeling itself aggrieved at the decision of the lower court in overruling its demurrer on October 25, 1922, the petitioner here applied to this court for a writ of certiorari to review such proceedings, contending that the lower court acted in excess of its jurisdiction. It is then alleged that November 27, 1922, 1 this court denied the application for the writ for the alleged reason that the question of the jurisdiction of the lower court had not been presented to that court prior to the application for the writ of certiorari in this court. That the petitioner has always contended that the lower court was acting in excess of its jurisdiction, and that after its writ was denied here it immediately applied to the lower court for the reconsideration of its order overruling the demurrer, and specifically calling the attention of the lower court to the fact that it was acting in excess of its jurisdiction. The petition for reconsideration was then heard in the lower court and overruled. It is then alleged that the Court of First Instance was acting in excess of its jurisdiction, and will continue to do so unless restrained by this court, and that your petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. In response to the order of this court, the respondents here appeared and filed an answer in which they deny all of the material allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense, allege that the municipal council of Masantol may be reconvened by the Court of First Instance for the purpose of correcting its canvass, and that in the mandamus proceedings the question was not that the board of elected, but that the board should proceed to the mathematical computation of the returns, and that the election protest which was dismissed is not res judicata as to the mandamus proceedings; that there, is no identity of the parties; that the election contest is brought against the candidates voted for in their respective offices while in the mandamus proceedings the action is against the board of canvassers; that the subject-matter is not identical; that the object of the election protest was to contest the title of the respondents to the respective offices, but that the purpose of the mandamus proceedings is to procure an order from the court to compel the board of canvassers to correct its canvass and to make it conform with the genuine returns; that the election protests were dismissed on technical grounds; that the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to compel the board of canvassers to correct its error, because it is not a discretionary but a ministerial duty; that the grounds alleged in the pending petition are identical with those alleged in the former petition for a writ of certiorari , No. 19803, which was dismissed by this Court, with costs, on November 27, 1922, and that the present petition must be denied following the doctrine of Lucido and Lucido v.

At the conclusion of the trial, the court found the defendants Simplicio Marcellana, Victorino Catapang, and Agaton Panganiban guilty as principals and Candido Villanueva as an accomplice of the crime of homicide, and sentenced the first three to twelve years and one day of reclusion temporal, and the last to six years and one day of prison mayor, and all of them to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, to the accessories of the law, and each of them to pay one-fifth of the costs. From the judgment the defendant Agaton Panganiban alone appeals to this court, contending, first, that the trial court erred in granting the petition of the fiscal to discharge Eleuterio Poco, so that he could be used as a witness for the Government, and that the evidence was not sufficient to convict this defendant of the crime of homicide beyond a reasonable doubt.

      "STATEMENT For a number of years prior to the times alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff was in the employ of the International Banking Corporation of Manila, and it is conceded that he is a competent and experienced business man July 31, 1916, C. D. Willits and I. L. Patterson were partners doing business in San Francisco, California, under the name of Willits & Patterson. The plaintiff was then in San Francisco, and as a result of negotiations the plaintiff and the firm entered into a written contract, known in the record as Exhibit A, by which the plaintiff was employed as the agent of the firm in the Philippine Islands for certain purposes for the period of five years at a minimum salary of $200 per month and travelling expenses. The plaintiff returned to Manila and entered on the discharge of his duties under the contract. As a result of plaintiff’s employment and word war conditions, the business of the firm in the Philippines very rapidly increased and grew beyond the fondest hopes of either party. A dispute arose between the plaintiff and the firm as to the construction of Exhibit A as to the amount which plaintiff should receive for his services. Meanwhile Patterson retired from the firm and Willits became the sole owner of its assets. For convenience of operation and to serve his own purpose, Willits organized a corporation under the laws of California with its principal office at San Francisco, in and by which he subscribed for, and became the exclusive owner of, all the capital stock, except a few shares for organization purposes only, and the name of the firm was used as the name of the corporation. A short time after that Willits came of Manila and organized a corporation here known as Willits & Patterson, Ltd., in and to which he again subscribed for all of the capital stock except the nominal shares necessary to qualify the directors. In legal effect, the San Francisco corporation took over and acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the Manila corporation. At the time that Willits was in Manila and while to all intents and purposes he was sole owner of the stock of corporations, there was a conference between him and the plaintiff over the disputed construction of Exhibit A. As a result of which another instrument, known in the record as Exhibit B, was prepared in the form of a letter which the plaintiff addressed to Willits at Manila on November 10, 1919, the purpose of which was to more clearly define and specify the compensation which the plaintiff was to receive for his services. Willits received and confirmed this letter by signing the name of Willits & Patterson, By C. D. Willits. At that time both corporations were legally organized, and there is nothing in the corporate minutes to show that Exhibit B was ever formally ratified or approved by either corporation. After its organization, the Manila corporation employed a regular accountant whose duty it was to audit the accounts of the company and render financial statements both for the use of the local banks and the local and parent corporations at San Francisco. From time to time and in the ordinary course of business such statement of account were prepared by the accountant and duly forwarded to the home office, and among other things was a statement of July 31, 1921, showing that there was due and owing the plaintiff under Exhibit B the sum of P106,277.50. A short time previous to that date, the San Francisco corporation became involved in financial trouble, and all of its assets were turned over to a \"creditors’ committee.\" When this statement was received, the \"creditors’ committee\" immediately protested its allowance. An attempt was made without success to adjust the matter on a friendly basis and without litigation. January 10, 1922, the plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant the sum of P106,277.50 with legal interest and costs, and the written instruments known in the record as Exhibits A and B were attached to, and made a part of, the complaint. For answer, the defendant admits the formal parts of the complaint, the execution of Exhibit A and denies each and every other allegation, except as specifically admitted, and alleges that what is known as Exhibits B was signed by Willits without the authority of the defendant corporation or the firm of Willits & Patterson, and that it is not an agreement which was ever entered into with the plaintiff by the defendant or the firm, and, as a separate defense and counterclaim, it alleges that on the 30th of Jun, 1920, there was a balance due and owing the plaintiff from the defendant under the contract Exhibit A of the sum of P 8,741.05 That his salary from June 30, 1920, to July 31, 1921, under Exhibit A was $400 per month, or a total of P10,400. That about July 6, 1921, the plaintiff wrong fully took P30,000 from the assets of he firm, and that he is now indebted to the firm in the sum of P10,858.95, with interest and costs, from which it prays judgment. The plaintiff admits that he withdrew the P30,00, but alleges that it was with the consent and authority of the defendant, and denies all other new matter in the answer. Upon such issues a trial was had, and the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, as prayed for in its counterclaim, from which the plaintiff appeals, contending that the trial court erred in not holding that the contract between the parties is that which is embodied in Exhibits A and B, and that the defendant assumed all partnership obligations, and in failing to render judgment for the plaintiff, as prayed form and in dismissing his complaint, and denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.

In the course of time the grantor died and at the time of her death Pedro Emilio Mata, the grantee in the deed, and Ester Magno, entered upon and took possession of the lands. The plaintiff applied for and was appointed administrator of the estate of the grantor Severa Magno y Laureta, deceased, and made a demand upon the defendants for possession of the lands which was refused, resulting in this action by the plaintiff as administrator, to recover possession of the premises and the sum of P9,000 as the value of the products of the land from April 9, 1918, until the termination of the case, for the sum of P1,200 damages, for the unlawful and wrongful withholding of possession, and costs. Upon such issues the case was tried ad submitted upon a stipulation of facts to the effect that any title or right of possession which Pedro Emilio Mata has to the possession of the premises is founded upon Exhibit A. The lower court rendered judgment to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of the lands in question and the sum P1,050 the agreed rental value and costs, from which the defendants appeal, assigning nine different errors, the combined substance of which is that the lower court erred in holding that the donation made by the deceased, known as Exhibit A, should be construed under the provisions of article 620 of the Civil Code, and that the defendants did not acquire title to the lands under it, that their possession was illegal, and that the land was the property of the heirs of the deceased, and in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, and in overruling the defendants’ motion for a new trial.

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff alleges that he is a resident of the City of Manila, and that the defendant Fernandez Hemanos is a duly registered commercial partnership with its place of business in the same city, and that the other defendants are member of the partnership. That on November 17, 1920, Fernandez of Hermanos accepted a bill of exchange, which is now overdue, drawn in the City of New York by the American Iron Products Co., Inc., upon Fernandez Hermanos for the sum of $4,716.14, United States currency, payable ninety days after sight at the Asia Banking Corporation, with interest at the rate of 9 per cent. That the Bank endorsed the bill of acceptance and endorsement thereon are specifically plead in the complaint. At the time of the maturity of the bill of exchange, the current rate of Bank Demand drafts on New York was 128/4 per cent which would make the amount due payable on the bill of exchange at maturity P11,190.67, Philippine currency. It is then alleged that demand has been made and payment refused. Wherefore, plaintiff prays judgment for the amount, with interest at 9 per cent from February 15, 1921, and costs. For answer, the defendants make a specific denial of all the material allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense and counterclaim, allege that the defendant Fernandez Hermanos on February 4, 1920, entered into a contract with the plaintiff in his capacity as manager of the American Iron Products Co., Inc., copy of which is set forth in the pleading. That the Products Company sent the defendant a chain and at the same time and, founded upon the contract, drew the bill of exchange alleged in the complaint. That the defendant Fernandez Hermanos, believing that the chain sent by the American Iron Products Co., Inc., was in conformity with the conditions specified in the contract, accepted the bill of exchange as drawn. That the chain sent does not meet the conditions imposed by the contract. That by reason thereof the defendant refused and still refuses to accept the chain sent by the company, of which the defendant was notified, and has refused and still refuses to pay the bill of exchange, which was the price of the chain. As a counterclaim, the defendant alleges that due to the fact that the chain could not be used, he was damaged in the sum of P5,000, wherefore, defendants pray judgment for that amount and costs. Upon such issues, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts upon which the case was tried and submitted to the lower court, which rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff as prayed for in the complaint, from which the defendants appeal, claiming that the lower court erred in holding that \"there is in the record evidence sufficient to support this action,\" in holding that defendants’ Exhibit 4 is a certificate issued by Lloyd’s register of shipping, in rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and in not rendering judgment for the defendants, and in denying their motion for a new trial.

      "STATEMENT The plaintiff is domestic corporation, and defendant is a resident of the municipality of Zamboanga. September 30, 1921, plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant in which it is alleged that the parties are owners in joint tenancy of lots Nos. 38 and 55 of the cadastral plan of the Zamboanga townsite, expendiente No. 7880, registered under the Land Registration Act under Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 3433 and 3435. \"That the parties have not been able to make amicable partition of said parcels of land.\" Wherefore, plaintiff prays that the court order and direct the partition of the land and the improvements thereon between the parties as their interests shall appear, etc. November 1, 1921, the plaintiff filed a motion stating that at the time of filing of the original complaint, through an oversight, lot No. 36 was not included, and that since the filing of said complaint differences have arisen with regard to the accounting for the rental of the properties mentioned and described in the complaint; and that in the interests of both parties and of the proper administration of justice between them, all of their differences respecting said property should be adjusted in on and the same suit. Wherefore, it prays that the court permit the filing of the amended complaint, and that such answer as the defendant desires to make within the time for answer provided by law be also allowed. November 23, 1921, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for the reason \"that the defendant does not enter his appearance or file his answer, as required by law and the rules of the court.\" This motion was sustained. January 16, 1921, the court rendered a judgment founded upon the amended complaint dividing the land between the parties according to their respective interest, and awarding the plaintiff judgment for rent on lot No. 36 to December 31, 1921, in the sum of P131.25, and on lot No. 38 for P455.76, or a total of P587.01, together with the costs of the action. February 6, 1922, the defendant appeared and filed a motion to set aside the judgment and to grant a new trial upon the grounds, first, that he had never received personally or through any other person a copy of the complaint or any copy of the summons; second, that after having received the decision of the court by registered mail, he made a thorough investigation of all the inmates of the house, and each one of them denied having received any copy of the summons and complaint; third, that he did not have any knowledge that the case was pending, or that it was set for hearing on a certain date; fourth, that he known the nature of the complaint and the date of the hearing he would have presented proofs in support of his rights sufficient to obtained a decision in his favor; fifth, that in the interest of justice the decision should be set aside and a new trial granted, in order that the case may be adjudged and decided on the merits. The court overruled defendant’s motion, from which he appeals, claiming that the court erred in declaring the defendant in default by its order of January 9, 1922, and in ordering that the plaintiff and the defendant are the owners in common of the lots, and in sentencing the defendant to pay P587.01 as rents, and in decreeing the partition of the property, and denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

Tipton, June 22, 1921, known as the Prince claim upon ground alleged to have been located by the defendant, February 28, 1921, known as the Pig Fraction claim. The Prince claim overlaps the Pig Fraction claim on the northwesterly side and the Pig Fraction claim overlaps the Prince on the southeasterly side, and practically all of the working of the two claims are in the area in conflict. August 15, 1922, the defendant filed his application for a patent, notice of which was published as legally required. October 4, 1922, plaintiff filed his adverse, claiming that the boundaries of defendant’s claim were insufficiently marked, and that his location line and discovery were within the boundaries of the Waterfall claim, and that the Pig Fraction claim contains an extension of the same vein or lode which runs through the Crest claim held by the defendant. It appears that the original Pig claim was located on February 1, 1913, and that a half interest therein was conveyed to the defendant.

      "STATEMENT Based on a proper proceeding in December 8, 1920, U. de Poli was declared insolvent by the Court of First Instance of manila. January 4, 1921, the claim of Felisa Roman was presented to the assignee founded upon what is known in the record as Exhibit A, which is an agreement entered into by and between her and the insolvent on October 23, 1920. She then claimed that she placed in De Poli’s bodegas 3,031 quintals and 7 kilos of tobacco of the value of P78,815.69. That under the terms of the agreement, De Poli had paid her P15,000 in cash, and had executed four promissory notes for the balance, each for the sum of P15,953.92, and maturing in order thirty, sixty, ninety and one hundred and twenty days after their execution. She also claimed that all of the tobacco remained as her own, except that portion represented by the cash payment of P15,000. In her petition, she prayed for an order of the court that the option of De Poli to purchase the 2,201 bales and 57 bales of tobacco described in Exhibit A be cancelled, and that she be declared the sole owner thereof, unless the assignee of the insolvent secure her in the payment of the agreed purchase price. January 15, 1921, the assignee filed an answer to her petition in which he claims, among other things, that the four promissory notes were a valid claim against the insolvent estate and that delivery of the tobacco had been made and that title to it has passed to the insolvent. January 18, 1921, the lower court held in legal effect that the transaction was one of purchase and sale, and that under the provisions of article 1922 of the Civil Code, Felisa Roman, had a preference right for the amount of the unpaid purchase price on the proceeds from the sale of the tobacco then in the hands of the assignee, and ordered him to pay her the unpaid purchase price derived from the proceeds of such sale. April 19, 1921, Felisa Roman filed two other motions: (a) To declare null and void the contract of pledge between De Poli and the Asia Banking Corporation for 576 bales of the tobacco in question, and (b) to order the assignee to sell the 2, 777 fardos of tobacco for which the court had decided that she held a preference at the rate of P10 per quintal. This give rise to the case known as Roman v. Asia Banking Corporation (46 Phil., 705), decided by the Supreme Court on June 26, 1922, in which it was held in legal effect that the only lien upon the tobacco which Felisa Roman had claim was a vendor’s lien, and that the claim of the Asia Banking Corporation based upon quedans was superior to that of Felisa Roman. August 3, 1922, through other and different counsel Felisa Roman claimed that Exhibit A made between the parties on October 23, 1920, was a notarial agreement and, as such, was a public document, and that the claim of Felisa roman had a preference over all other creditors of her claim was P64,640.96, with interest at 10 per cent per annum from August 2, 1922, and that she be allowed such preference. March 8, 1924, the assignee filed written objections to the allowance of the claim as a preference, and alleged that the proceeds derived from the sale of the remainder of the tobacco had been paid over to the claimant in accordance with the order of January 18, 1921. That the question of the preference is now res judicata. That she did not have any preference and that her claim should be denied. March 18, 1924, and apparently without a hearing or the taking of any testimony, the lower court made an order that: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The balance still unpaid of the claim of Felisa Roman, viz: the sum of P55,218.52, with interest of 10 per cent from November 19, 1920, is hereby allowed by this court with the preference due to its being evidenced by a public document.\" cralaw virtua1aw library From this decision the assignee and numerous creditors appeal, contending that the lower court erred in failing to sustain the plea of res judicata and in applying article 1924 of the Civil code to the claim of Felisa Roman, in holding that she had a preference over other creditors of the insolvent estate, and in making its order without notice to the other creditors.

      "STATEMENT As a result of a preliminary investigation by the justice of the peace, the provincial fiscal filed an information against the defendant in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo charging him with the crime of homicide in the killing of Aniano Tijam. After the taking of some evidence the judge directed the fiscal to file an information against the defendant charging him with the crime of murder, and in compliance with that order, the following information was filed: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The undersigned provincial fiscal of Iloilo accuses Gabriel de los Angeles of the crime of murder committed as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"That on or about December 29, 1923, in the municipality of Ajuy, Province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, the aforesaid accused did intentionally, maliciously and criminally and with treachery assault and stab Aniano Tijam, inflicting a mortal wound on his back, as a result of which said Aniano Tijam died on March 3, 1924. Contrary to law.\" cralaw virtua1aw library When the defendant was arraigned upon the last information, he plead not guilty and interposed the defense of double jeopardy, which the court overruled and to which an exception was duly taken. As a result of the trial the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, with the accessory penalties and to pay the costs. From this sentence the defendant appeals, contending that the trial court erred in holding, after the accused had plead not guilty, that the information for homicide should be dismissed, and in directing the fiscal to file another one for the crime of murder and in denying the petition of the defendant for a preliminary investigation for the higher crime. and in holding that the accuse was not in double jeopardy, and in finding that alevosia existed in the commission of the crime and in construing the evidence and in finding the defendant guilty of the crime charged, and in failing to find that he was not guilty.

      "STATEMENT August 16, 1922, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance against the defendant in which after formal pleas, he alleges: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"III. That on the 5th day of May, 1922, in the Supreme Court of Hongkong, the same being a court of competent jurisdiction and having jurisdiction over both the plaintiff and the defendant in a certain action wherein the plaintiff herein was plaintiff and the defendant here was defendant, a final judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant a duly certified transcript of which said judgment is hereto attached, marked Exhibit A. \"IV. That the said judgment has not been reversed or modified and is still in full force and effect. \"V. That on the 30th day of June, 1922, costs were duly taxed and allowed in the said Supreme Court of Hongkong in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the sum of twenty-six thousand two hundred and forty-four and 23/100 dollars ($26,244.23), Hongkong currency, as appears by the certificate of the registrar of the said Supreme Court of Hongkong, hereto attached and made a part hereof. \"VI. That demand has been made by plaintiff upon defendant for the payment of the said sum of twenty-six thousand two hundred and forty-four and 23/100 dollars ($26,244.23), Hongkong currency, but that defendant has failed and refused and still fails and refuses to pay plaintiff the said sum or any part thereof. \"VII. That the equivalent of the said sum of twenty-six thousand two hundred and forty-four and 23/100 dollars ($26,244.23), Hongkong currency, on the said 30th day of June, 1922, was thirty-one thousand ninety-nine pesos and forty-one centavos (P31,099.41), Philippine currency.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Wherefore, he prays judgment for the amount, with legal interest, and for such other and further relief as may seem just and equitable. A duly certified transcript of the judgment of the Hongkong court was attached to the complaint, marked Exhibit A. For amended answer, the defendant denies each and every allegation of the complaint, and, as a separate special defense, alleges that the judgment in question should be considered in connection with the decision of the Supreme Court of Hongkong, a copy of which is attached to and made a part of the answer, marked Exhibit 1. That the decision and judgment of that court were rendered and entered as a result of a clear mistake of law and fact. \"3. That previous to the 25th day of January, 1919, A. Mitchell Palmer, the duly appointed, qualified and acting Alien Property Custodian of the United States, under and by virtue of the Act of Congress of the United States approved October 6, 1917, known as the Trading with the Enemy Act as amended, and in accordance with executive orders issued in pursuance thereof, required and caused to be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered and paid over to him the property and business then owing and belonging to, or held for, by, or on account of, or on behalf, or for the benefit of the company known as Syndicat Oriente, a joint account association (sociedad de cuentas en participacion), of which the plaintiff was the ’gestor,’ and which association formed under the laws of Belgium with its registered office in the City of Antwerp, Belgium, and an enemy as defined in said Act, not holding a license granted by the President under said Trading with the Enemy Act, and which the President of the United States, after investigation had determined was so owing, or so belonged, or was so held, and thereafter the said Alien Property Custodian in pursuance of said Act and proclamations and executive orders, advertised that he would sell through his managing director of the Philippine Islands to the highest bidder at public sale, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advertisement of sale, the said property and business of the Syndicat Oriente and of the said plaintiff as its ’gestor’ on the 27th day of December, 1918, at Manila in the Philippine Islands, and pursuant to said advertisement of sale, and in compliance with all the terms and conditions therein set forth, and after due and public notice given thereof, on the 27th day of December, 1918, duly sold at public sale at Manila, Philippine Islands, the said property and business, with certain exceptions immaterial to this case, mentioned in the deed of conveyance hereinafter referred to, in consideration of the bid therefor by the said defendant corporation of the bid therefor by the said defendant corporation of the sum of P2,350,000, Philippine currency, which was the highest bid of any bidder qualified to bid for and purchase said property and business at said sale, and the said Alien Property Custodian of the United States having thereafter accepted said bid and received from the defendant corporation in cash the amount of said bid, did on the 25th day of January, 1919, under and by virtue of said Act of Congress and said proclamations and executive orders, execute in favor of the defendant corporation a deed of conveyance of said property and business of the said Syndicat Oriente and of the said plaintiff as its ’gestor,’ a copy of which deed marked Exhibit 2 for identification is hereto attached and made a part of this amended answer and counterclaim. \"4. That among the property conveyed and described in said deed so executed by the Alien Property Custodian of the cigar and cigarette factory situated in the City of Manila, Philippine Islands, known as ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos, C. Ingenohl,’ and all incidents and appurtenances thereto including the business as a going concern and the goodwill, trade names and trade-marks thereof, and of the said Syndicat Oriente.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That at all times said C. Ingenohl mentioned therein was the gestor of the said Syndicat Oriente and plaintiff in this action. That based upon the claim of the plaintiff for himself and as gestor and agent of the Syndicat Oriente, in the year 1921, the plaintiff collected and received from the Alien Property Custodian of the United States, the purchase price of the property mentioned and described in this answer and counterclaim and thereby ratified confirmed the sale and conveyance of the property to the defendant to all intents and purposes, the same as if the sale had originally been made by plaintiff to the defendant. \"7. That at the time of the conveyance of said property to the defendant corporation and for many years previous and subsequent thereto, and up to the time of the wrongful acts of the plaintiff as hereinafter set forth, China, the colony of Hongkong, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlement were the principal markets for the output of the cigars manufactured in the said cigar factory, and the only trade-marks and trade names under which said cigars were sold in those markets by the plaintiff previous to said conveyance, and by the defendant subsequent thereto were ’La Perla del Oriente,’ ’El Cometa del Oriente’ and ’Imperiod del Mundo;’ that by the sale of large quantities of the output of said cigar factory in said markets by the plaintiff previous to said conveyance, and by the defendant thereafter under said trade-marks and trade names and by the appropriate registration of said trade-marks and trade names in said countries, the plaintiff previous to said conveyance, and the defendant thereafter as his successor in interest appropriated, acquired and became entitled to the exclusive use of said trade-marks and trade names in said factory.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That by virtue of the fact that the plaintiff took and accepted the purchase price for the sale of the property, he thereby ratified and confirmed the peaceable possession and enjoyment and the use of the property, including said trade-marks and trade names, the same is if he had personally made the sale. \"9. That on or about the 25th day of May, 1919, the said trade-marks and trade names known as ’La Perla del Oriente’ and ’El Cometa del Oriente’ were duly registered at Shanghai in the name of the defendant corporation for all of China with the exception of the colony of Hongkong, which is British territory and where separate registration proceeding were and are required; that by virtue of said registration and by virtue of the sale under said trade-marks and trade names of the cigars manufactured in said factory by the plaintiff previous to said conveyance and by the defendant as his successor in interest thereafter, the latter acquired the sold and exclusive right to the use of said trade-marks and trade names in all of China.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That at the time the plaintiff accepted the proceeds of the sale, he well knew that the Property Custodian intended to and did sell and convey to the defendant, and that the defendant believed that it acquired and did acquire the exclusive right to the use of said trade-marks and trade names in said markets, and that the said trade-marks and trade names had been duly registered at Shanghai for all of China in the name of the corporation, and that at the time he accepted such proceeds, the plaintiff well knew that the defendant ever since the purchase of the property was selling the product of said factory under said trade-marks and trade names in all of said market. That plaintiff also knew the value of them at the time of the sale was P1,000,000, and that said trade-marks and trade names evidenced P1,000,000 of purchased price of the property. That after obtaining the proceeds of the sale, the plaintiff wrongfully instituted the said action in the Supreme Court of the colony of Hongkong, resulting in the rendition of the judgment in question. That at the time it was rendered the Hongkong, resulting in the rendition of the judgment in question. That at the time it was rendered the Hongkong court had before it and under consideration the deed of conveyance executed by the Property Custodian to the defendant and facsimiles of the trade-marks and trade names and the admission of the plaintiff that he had received the proceeds of the sale from the Property Custodian. That notwithstanding such facts, the Hongkong court decided in effect that the language \"wheresoever situate in the Philippine Islands\" was a limitation upon the goodwill and right to the use of said trade-marks and trade names to the Philippine Islands, whereas in truth and in fact, as the plaintiff well knew at the time of said conveyance, almost the entire output of the factory in the City of Manila was exported and sold outside of the Philippine Islands, and that the intention of said conveyance was to convey the right to the use of said conveyance was to convey the right to the use of said trade-marks and trade names outside of the Philippine Islands, and that plaintiff willfully concealed and withheld said facts from the Hongkong court, and induced it to hold in effect that the right to the use of said trade-marks was limited by the conveyance to the Philippine Islands. The trade-marks in question are then specifically described. That the plaintiff in the Hongkong court claimed to be the proprietor of the trade-marks and trade names known as \"La Perla del Oriente,\" \"El Cometa del Oriente\" and \"Imperio del Mundo,\" in connection with cigars manufactured by him in the factory at Mongkok, Hongkong, known as Hongkong factory, and which at the time of the conveyance, was a mere branch of the Manila cigar factory. That the plaintiff in the Hongkong court claimed to be the proprietor of the trade-marks and trade names known as \"La Perla del Oriente,\" \"El Cometa del Oriente\" and \"Imperio del Mundo,\" in connection with cigars manufactured by him in the factory at Mongkok, Hongkong, known as the Hongkong factory, and which at the time of the conveyance, was a mere branch of the Manila cigar factory. That the trial in the Hongkong court it appeared that between the years 1882 and 1905, \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos Sociedad Anonima,\" hereinafter referred to as \"Sociedad Anonima,: carried on a business as manufacturers of cigars and cigarettes in Manila, Philippine Islands, made use of the trade-marks and trade names, which are in dispute in this action. That on November 28, 1905, the \"Sociedad Anonima,\" being then n liquidation, sold all of its business interests and assets in the Philippine Islands with it s goodwill and trade-marks, including those in dispute here, to the plaintiff as a gestor of a joint association consisting of the plaintiff and others, which was known as the Syndicat Oriente, and carried on its business in the Philippine Islands under the style of \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos, C. Ingenohl, Manila.\" That in the year 1908 the Syndicat Oriente opened the Hongkong factory, as a branch or agency, for the manufacture and sale in Hongkong of cigars which were made of the tobacco supplied by \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos\" in the Philippine Islands in the years 1884 and 1887 as the property of the said \"Sociedad Anonima\" and such registration was renewed in the year 1902. That in the year 1903 they were registered on the Hongkong register of trade-marks as the property of the \"Sociedad Anonima.\" That about April, 1906, the assignment of the said trade-marks to \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos\" was registered in the Philippine Islands, and in February, 1910, they were assigned on the Hongkong register with the knowledge and authority and by direction of the plaintiff, to the name of said Syndicat Oriente under its name and style of \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos, C. Ingenohl, Manila,\" as proprietor. That on March 13, 1917, the plaintiff renewed the registration of such trade-marks on the Hongkong register for a further period of fourteen years from the 15th of April, 1917, in the same name, to wit: \"El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos, C. Ingenohl, Manila,\" as proprietor. That such trade-marks and trade names were inseparably connected and identified with the cigars manufactured in the Manila factory, and that the Hongkong factory had no right to the use of them, except as a branch of the Manila factory, and that the use of them by the Hongkong factory after conveyance to the defendant constitutes a false representation and fraud upon the public purchasing such cigars, and upon this defendant in particular. That under the laws of Great Britain, United States and the Philippine Islands, trade-marks and trade names, such as those in dispute, belong to and follow the product of the factory with which they are identified, and the use of them upon the products of any other factory constitutes a fraud upon the public. That under such laws the acceptance by the former owner of the proceeds of the sale amounts to a ratification of the sale had been made by the owner himself, and that as construed by the laws of Great Britain, United States and the Philippine Islands, the deed of conveyance was not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation placed upon it by the Hongkong court, to the effect that the goodwill and right to the use of the trade-marks and trade names were limited to the Philippines Islands. That the Hongkong court ignored such facts and rendered its decision contrary to the clear language used in the conveyance. By way of counterclaim, the defendant alleges all of such material facts, and that the action in the Hongkong court was wrongfully instituted by the plaintiff against the defendant. That after the rendition of such judgment and in violation of the terms of the sale and conveyance, the plaintiff, through his solicitors, agents, and representatives, has been and is still wrongfully and unlawfully causing to be inserted in the leading newspapers in China, the Federated Malay States, Straits Settlements, and elsewhere, newspaper articles notifying the public of the rendition of the judgment in which he claims and asserts his exclusive right to the use of the trade-marks and trade names in all of said countries, and threatens to take legal proceedings against any person, firm, or corporation which has in its possession for sale cigars bearing the said trade-marks and trade names, which are not manufactured by the branch factory at Hongkong, and also by giving notices to the tobacco dealers. That by reason of said notices and the threats, the cigar dealers have cancelled all pending orders and have refused to make any further purchases of cigars without guaranties, protecting them against the threatened legal proceedings of plaintiff. That the goodwill of the cigar business of the defendant and the value of such trade-marks and trade names have been totally destroyed by the plaintiff, and that he has wrongfully and unlawfully deprived the defendant of the use and enjoyment of them, to the defendant’s damage in the sum of P1,000,000 for which it prays judgment, with costs. Upon such issues the parties entered into the following agreed statement of facts: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Agreed statement of facts \"Without prejudice to the introduction of such oral and documentary evidence as either party may present at the time fixed by the Court for the trial of this case, and saving all just objections and exceptions to the admissibility of such facts, or any of them, as evidence in this case, it is hereby mutually stipulated and agreed by and between the parties, their counsel and attorneys, as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1.

That Exhibit 1 attached to defendant’s amended answer and counterclaim is a true copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Hongkong, upon which the judgment referred to in the third paragraph of plaintiff’s complaint was based; \"6. That Exhibit 2 attached to defendant’s amended answer and counterclaim is a true copy of the Deed of Transfer executed on the 25th day of January, 1919, by A. Mitchell Palmer, the duly appointed, qualified and acting Alien Property Custodian of the United States in favor of the defendant corporation, and that the recitals contained in said Deed of Transfer were and are true, except that the Syndicat Oriente mentioned therein was formed under the laws of Belgium with its head office at Antwerp, by Articles of Agreement dated November 28, a copy of which marked Exhibit B is hereto attached and made a part hereof.

That at the time of the conveyance of said property by the Alien Property Custodian of the United States to the defendant corporation and for many years previous and subsequent thereto, and up to the time of the rendition by said Supreme Court of Hongkong of the judgment (Exhibit A), China, the colony of Hongkong, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements, were among the markets in which the output of the cigars manufactured in the cigar factory known previous to its conveyance to the defendant corporation as ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos,’ and that among the trade-marks and trade names under which such cigars were sold in those markets by the plaintiff previous to said conveyance and by the defendant subsequent thereto were ’La Perla del Oriente,’ ’El Cometa del Oriente’ and ’Imperio del Mundo;’ \"10.

That said transfer was effected by means of an instrument, in writing, a copy of which is hereto attached marked Exhibit J. That plaintiff, as ’Gerant’ of said Syndicat Oriente which had been organized in the meantime for that purpose, carried on business in the Philippine Islands and throughout the Far East under the style of ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacco, C. Ingenohl, Manila’ (hereinafter referred to as ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos’); \"17. That in the year 1908 the plaintiff, as ’Gerant’ of said Syndicat Oriente, opened the said Hongkong factory for the manufacture and sale of cigars which were composed, in part, of tobacco supplied by ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos’ in the Philippine Islands, and, in part, of tobacco wrapper imported from Java. That subsequent to the establishment of the said Hongkong factory its output was sold throughout the Far East (except in the Philippine Islands) concurrently with the output of the Manila factory under the trade-marks and trade names in question, except that on one of the outside labels of each box or package containing the output of the said Hongkong factory there appeared the words ’El Oriente Fabrica de Tabacos Hongkong, Sucursal de la Fabrica en Manila.’ That a facsimile of one of said covering labels marked Exhibit 1 is hereto attached and made a part hereof; \"18. That the only factory belonging to the said ’Sociedad Anonima’ of Antwerp as the Manila factory, and the only factory belonging to the plaintiff personal or as ’Gerant’ of the Syndicat Oriente was the said Manila factory up until the time of the establishment of the said Hongkong factory, and thereafter the only factories owned by the plaintiff or the said Syndicat Oriente were the said Manila and Hongkong factories; \"19. That the said trade-marks which are in dispute in this action were registered in the Philippine Islands in the years 1884-1887 as the property of the said ’Sociedad Anonima’ and registration thereof in the Philippine Islands of said property was renewed in the year 1902; \"20.

      "STATEMENT April 2, 1924, the defendants, as heir of Francisca de Vera, deceased, filed the following verified petition in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Come now the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez and, through their undersigned attorney, respectfully show: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. That by an order dated October 5, 1923, the Honorable Court approved the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims whereby, among other things, the claim of Tomas C. Reyes against the intestate estate of Francisca de Vera is admitted for the total sum of P8,901.78. \"2. That thereafter, to wit, on the 19th day of March, 1924, another order was issued by this Honorable Court stating the manner in which payment of said claim should be paid. \"3. That the first order, as well as the second, abovementioned, was issued without opposition by any of the parties, in view of the fact that an understanding existed at least on the part of the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez, that the aforesaid claim was true, and not, as it is, fictitious and fraudulent. \"4. That it was only last Thursday, March 27, 1924, that the petitioners discovered the aforesaid credit to be fraudulent and fictitious, and since then they have endeavored to find proof confirming the discovery. \"5. That from this discovery it appears as a matter of fact that the alleged claim for P8,901.78 of Tomas C. Reyes against the intestate estate is completely fictitious and fraudulent, and that the three documents of credit, appearing in the record, on pages 159, 160 and 161, presented by Tomas C. Reyes ad evidence of his claim, are false and falsified documents, and that they are done only in February, 1922, that is to say, several months after the death of Francisca de Vera, and the latter could not, therefore, have taken part in the execution of said documents. \"6. That said three documents of credit, even if they purport to bear the thumbmark of Francisca de Vera, in fact the thumbmark placed in the three documents is that of a third person, to wit, her granddaughter, Andrea Geraldez, daughter of the other heir, Simeona de Mendoza, according to what was discovered by the petitioners afterwards, as may be seen from the enclosed documents which are made a part of this petition. \"7. That notwithstanding the fact that they have endeavored to find evidence against the claim presented by Tomas C. Reyes, which claim has already aroused suspicion, in view of the fact that the deceased Francisca de Vera, on account of her manner of her living and her saving habit, was unable to spend P8,000 in so short a time, this discovery could not have been made by the petitioners before this time, and it happened only on account of the disclosure made by an eyewitness to the deceit, who cannot permit that the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez be unjustly deprived of a great portion of their inheritance. \"8. That if the orders of this Honorable Court dated October 5, 1923, and March 19, 1924, above-mentioned, are complied with, Tomas C. Reyes and his associates would be satisfied to see the success of their fraudulent machination. \"9. That in the interest of justice and equity, the two orders referred to should be set aside, and the petitioners Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez permitted to impugn the claim of Tomas C. Reyes, to oppose the same and appeal from the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims, and go through all other legal proceedings, to test the claim of Tomas C. Reyes, and the judicial administrator be ordered to appeal from the decision of the commissioners on appraisal and claims. \"10. That 25 days have elapsed since the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims was presented, and neither the judicial administrator nor the petitioners herein can now appeal in accordance with section 775 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in relation with sections 773, 774, 776 and 777 of the same Code. \"11. That six months have not yet expired since the issuance of the order of this Honorable Court dated October 5, 1923, approving the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims. \"12. That in presenting this petition, the petitioners invoke the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which are applicable to the instant case. . . . x       x       x \"For all of the foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that the orders dated October 5, 1923, approving the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims, and March 19, 1924, be set aside; that the judicial administrator be ordered to appeal from said report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims, insofar as it refers to the alleged claim of Tomas C. Reyes; that the petitioners be permitted to appeal from the same report, and that, for the time being, all proceeding in this intestate estate, having reference to the payment of the said claim, be suspended, on the ground of being fraudulent.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Based upon the petition the court made the following order: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Considering the petition dated April 2, 1924, presented by counsel for the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez, to set aside the orders dated October 5, 1923, and March 19, 1924, rendered in this case, whereby the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims is approved and the claim of Tomas C. Reyes is admitted against this estate, and that the judicial administrator be ordered to appeal from the report of the commissioners insofar as it refers to the aforesaid claim of Tomas C. Reyes and that the heirs be permitted to appeal from the report referred to, suspending in the meantime all proceeding in this case relative to the payment of said claim, for being fraudulent.

      "STATEMENT In 1922 arrangements were made with the United States in and by which the Naval Collier Pompey, which was then at Olongapo, was turned over to the Government of the Philippine Islands for its use and benefit. This was done without charge and upon the recommendation of the Governor-General, that the collier was the type of ship which the Government of the Philippine Islands required to market its coal from the mines of the National Coal Company. it later appeared that in the marketing of this coal, the collier was operated at a loss. The National Coal Company applied for and was granted a permit by the Public Utility Commissioner to operate the collier as a public carrier and public utility between Manila and Malangas, with option to call at the ports of Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, Dumaguete and Tacloban. it further appears that under such license, the collier was permitted to charge lower rates than commercial vessels were authorized to charge over the same route. Under the conditions then existing, no objection was filed to the granting of this license. Under change conditions, the continued operation of the steamship Pompey seriously injured the Compania Maritima and Fernandez Hermanos, the first of which had been operating over the same route since the Spanish regime, and the Fernandez Hermanos for the last eighteen years. On February 27, 1923, the National Coal Company applied for another license to authorize it to include the port of Davao in its regular schedule. To this application objections were made not only by the Compania Maritima and Fernandez Hermanos but also by the Philippine Shipowners’ Association, upon the ground that the granting of such a license to the steamship Pompey for the coastwise trade was prejudicial to the public interests, and that upon its last voyage, the Pompey carried a large cargo and at lower rates than those which the commercial carriers were authorized to charge, and they prayed that the certificate of public convenience issued October 12, 1922, in case No. 2875, should be revoked on the following grounds: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. That the steamship Pompey was not ceded to the Government of the Philippine Islands for commercial purposes; \"2. That no capital has been invested in the operation of said steamer; \"3. That it is the policy of the Government not to compete with private individuals in commercial and industrial enterprises; \"4. That the competition is obviously ruinous; \"5. That the utilization of this vessel on any route where commercial vessels are being operated with the consent of the Commission, results in a ruinous competition (case No. 3213, folio 1).\" cralaw virtua1aw library April 3, 1923, the Utility Commission was notified that the route between Manila and Mindanao was adequately served by commercial vessels, and that no permit should be granted the national Coal Company to call at Mindanao ports. Notwithstanding such objections, permits were granted by the Commission to include Davao as a port of call pending the final decision of the Commission. In the course of business and by mutual consent of all parties, the objections were consolidated and the cases tried as one, and the Commission rendered its decision denying both of the petitions of the National Coal Company. From this decision the National Coal Company appeals to this court, making the following assignment of errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The Public Utility Commissioner erred in not holding in his decision that, it being optional on the part of the vessels of Fernandez Hermanos to make port at Davao, the same offers less securities and reciprocal rights to passengers, merchants and shippers than would the making of said port a regular port of call, as applied for by the vessel Pompey. \"II. The Public Utility Commissioner erred in not holding in his decision that, it being optional on the part of the vessels of Fernandez Hermanos to make port at Davao, there is a period in the year when only two of the five vessels making trips in the southern ports used to make port at Davao, to the damage of the passengers, merchants and shippers of that port, who became isolated without any communication with Manila for a sufficiently long period of time. \"III. The Public Utility Commissioner erred in holding in his decision that it would in no manner promote the public interest of the residents of Davao to make Davao a regular port of call of the vessel Pompey, but, on the contrary, it would be competing with the vessels of Fernandez Hermanos to the latter’s damage. \"IV.

Plaintiff then alleges that he is the owner of an undivided one-eighth of a certain parcel of land situated in the barrio of Buac-Pulangbato, municipality of Bogo, Province of Cebu, containing an area of 74 hectares, which is specifically described in the complaint. That Agaton Ibañez, who was married to Bernarda de la Cerna, was the original owner of the land by virtue of a right of a composicion con el estado in 1882.

In September, 1899, Bernarda de la Cerna, Maria Ibañez, Micaela Ibañez and Paulino Ibañez, jr., sold and conveyed all of their interests in the 74 hectares to the defendant Pedro Rodriguez, leaving unsold and unconveyed the one-eighth interest of the plaintiff, who was then a minor, in such portion. That the defendant Pedro Rodriguez, taking advantage of the minority and tender age of the plaintiff, unlawfully took possession of his interest in the land sold and retained possession thereof until he sold the same to the defendant Marcos Rubio, although he expressly promised on April 22, 1905, to return on demand to this plaintiff, his share of that land. That in the year 1905, the defendant Pedro Rodriguez sold the same land to the defendant Marcos Rubio, including the one-eighth portion of the plaintiff, and without his knowledge and consent.

That the defendant Rodriguez received all of the crops and products of the land sold from the year 1899 to the year 1905, and that it is first-class land, and has been continuously cropped with sugar and corn. That at divers and sundry times for the last seven years prior to the year 1920, the plaintiff has made a demand on the defendant for an accounting for his undivided one-eighth interest of the products, but that notwithstanding such promises, no accounting has ever been made. That by reason of the acts and conduct of the defendant Rodriguez, the plaintiff has suffered damages in the sum of P10,000, and that by reason of the acts and conduct of the defendant Rubio, plaintiff has been damaged in the sum of P25,000. That the defendant obtained the Torrens title to the land on September 30, 1920, his title being numbered 2223, which was annulled by the lower court on the ground of fraud committed by the defendant Rubio, and that the decision annulling his title was confirmed by the Supreme Court on May 18, 1922, in G.R. No. 17981. 1 That in September, 1918, at the time the original application of the Rubio was filed, the plaintiff was a minor. That he reached the age of majority on January 6, 1920.

For answer, the defendants Pedro Rodriguez and Marcos Rubio admit the formal parts of the complaint, and specifically deny all other allegations which are not expressly admitted in the answer, and as a defense allege that the land in question was formerly the property of the spouses Agaton Ibañez and Bernarda de la Cerna, and that it was in legal effect their conjugal property. That as a result of the marriage, they had four children, Maria, Petrona, Paulino, and Micaela Ibañez. That Agaton Ibañez died in 1888, leaving as heirs his widow and his daughters Maria, Petrona and Micaela Ibañez, and his grandchild Paulino Ibañez, one of the defendants. That Petrona Ibañez died in 1898, leaving a natural son, who is the plaintiff, and her legitimate mother. That Bernarda de la Cerna died in the year 1907, and that her surviving heirs were Maria and Micaela Ibañez and her grandchildren Paulino Ibañez. That the plaintiff, although he is a natural son of Petrona Ibañez, on account of his being a natural child, has not in law the legal right to inherit from his grandmother. That on September 8, 1899, Bernarda de la Cerna, Maria, Micaela and Paulino Ibañez, by a public document, sold and conveyed the land in question to the defendant Pedro Rodriguez, without any reservation as to plaintiff’s portion, and that Pedro Rodriguez took actual possession of the land and ever since has been in such possession peacefully and quitely. That after the execution of the deed, the vendors took P125 from the amount of the purchase price and delivered it to Lazaro Ibañez for the use and benefit of the plaintiff, and about the year 1905, the money was returned to the defendant Rodriguez, with instructions to deliver it to the plaintiff upon his arriving at the age of majority or upon the appointment of a legal guardian, and that this defendant kept and held the money for the use and benefit of the minor. That at the time this action was commenced, it had increased to P500, which money this defendant has at all times been ready and willing to pay over to plaintiff, and has at all times recognized it as plaintiff’s money. That in 1916 the defendant Rodriguez sold the land in question to the defendant Marcos Rubio, and that Marcos Rubio purchased the land without any knowledge of plaintiff’s rights, and that he believed that he acquired a good and valid title from Pedro Rodriguez, free from all liens and encumbrances. As a first special defense, the defendants allege that in the year 1909 all of the heirs of Agaton Ibañez and Bernarda de la Cerna, including the plaintiff, divided among themselves all of the other lands of the deceased, exclusive of the land in question, and that the plaintiff received his portion of such lands, and has been in possession of it ever since. That the plaintiff has ratified the partition and has cured any defect there may have been and is now estopped to question the legality of the partition as to any portion which should be allotted to him out of the inheritance. That in truth and in fact he received more lands out of the partition than he was justly entitled to receive. For second special defense, it is alleged that even though the plaintiff, as a son of Petrona Ibañez, may have some right of the land in question, since he has to take from the inheritance of his mother in connection with his natural grandmother, he cannot take more than one-fourth which must be taken from the free portion under provisions of article 841 of the Civil Code, in connection with articles 809 and 942, or undivided one-thirty-second interest in the original estate. That under such provisions plaintiff can only take two hectares, thirty-one areas and twenty-five centares. As a third special defense, defendants allege that any right, title or interest which the plaintiff may have has been prescribed, and that the title to said land is now absolute by prescription in the defendant Marcos Rubio. The answers of the remaining defendants are not material to this opinion. Upon such issues, the lower court rendered a judgment against the defendants Pedro Rodriguez and Marcos Rubio to the effect that the plaintiff was the owner of an undivided one-thirty-second interest in the land, and the he have judgment against them jointly and severally for P9,208, the value of the sugar crops, and P910, the value of the corn crops, or a total of P10,118, together with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, on such values for each respective year, dating from the year that the crops were harvested, and costs of the action. Both parties appeal, the plaintiff contending that the court erred in holding that the plaintiff is entitled to one-thirty-second interest of the land in question, including its products, and in not admitting a certified copy of a decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu in registration case No. 93, and in not admitting a certified copy of a decision of the Honorable Supreme Court, affirming the judgment of the lower court to the effect that title to the land was obtained by the defendant Marcos Rubio through fraud. The defendants made the following assignments of error: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"First Error \"The trial court erred in not finding as a fact proven that the defendant Marcos Rubio bought from the other defendant Pedro Rodriguez in the year 1905 all the 75 hectares of land described in the complaint. \"Second Error \"The trial court erred in declaring in its findings of fact that at the of taking possession of the land in question Marcos Rubio had knowledge of the fact that the plaintiff Agaton Ibañez had a right over said land and its products. \"Third Error \"The trial court erred in giving credit to the testimony of Agaton Ibañez and in basing upon the facts established by said testimony a large part of its findings of fact in the judgment appealed from. \"Fourth Error \"The trial court erred in extending the effect of the acts of the defendant Pedro Rodriguez to the defendant Marcos Rubio and vice versa, in order to establish solidarity between them in their supposed liability. \"Fifth Error \"The trial court erred in establishing as a measure for determining the damages claimed by the plaintiff that the land described in the complaint produced crops of sugar to the amount of P52,000 yearly at the average rate of 4,000 piculs of sugar at P15 per picul during the period included in seventeen harvests of sugar, with the exception of the harvest of corn. \"Sixth Error \"The trial court erred in not sustaining the allegation of the defendant Pedro Rodriguez that he executed Exhibit A merely in order to prevent the plaintiff’s share in the price of the land, according to Exhibit 3, from being wasted during his minority by Maria Ibañez. \"Seventh Error \"The trial court erred in not determining the effects of the document Exhibit 1 in connection with the pretended rights of the plaintiff over the land described in the complaint. \"Eight Error \"The trial court erred in making mention in the judgment appealed from of the incidents in connection with the application for registration of said land filed by Marcos Rubio, for the purpose of establishing the liability of the defendants for the damages claimed. \"Ninth Error \"The trial court erred in not absolving the defendants from the complaint and in sentencing them to pay the amount allowed in the said judgment by way of damages.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

Poizat and J.M. Poizat & Co. were declared in default. Without giving any notice to the defendants Jean M. Poizat, J.M. Poizat & Co. and Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, and after the introduction of evidence on the part of the plaintiff and the defendant Dominican Fathers, on June 24, 1924, the court rendered an opinion in substance and to the effect that the plaintiff should have judgment as prayed for in its complaint, and that the Dominican Fathers should have judgment for the amount of their claim, and that the property should be sold and the proceeds applied to satisfy the respective judgments. About August 26, through her attorney, the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas filed a motion in which she recites that she is the legitimate wife of the defendant Jean M. Poizat; that she had been absent from the Philippine Islands and residing in the City of Paris from the year 1908 to April 30, 1924, when she returned to Manila; that the time of filing of the complaint and the issuance of the summons, she was absent from the Philippine Islands; that the summons was delivered by the sheriff of the City of Manila to her husband, and that through his malicious negligence, default was taken and judgment entered for the respective amounts; that she never had any knowledge of the actual facts until the latter part of July, 1924, when, through the local newspapers, she learned that a default judgment had been rendered against her on July 28, 1924; that when she first knew of that fact, she was unable to obtain the rendition of accounts because her husband had rendition of accounts because her husband had left the Philippine Islands two days previous and gone to Hongkong; that she then went to Hongkong and learned that her husband had left there under a false name and had gone to the port of Singapore from whence he went to other places unknown to third defendant; that she then returned to Manila, and that in August, 1924, she came into possession of documents showing the illegality of the notes and mortgage in question; that she has a good and legal defense to the action, which involves the validity of the order of the Dominican Fathers in this, that their mortgage does not guarantee any loan made to this defendant; that it is a security only given for a credit of a third person; that the mortgage was executed without the marital consent of the wife; and that he did not have any authority to make her liable as surety on the debt of a third person; that as regards the notes to the plaintiff: First, it does not represent any money paid to the defendant by the bank; second, that it is exclusively the personal debt of the defendants Jean M. Poizat and J.M. Poizat & Co.; third, that it was executed by her husband, because the bank desired more security for the payment of her husband’s debt to the bank; fourth, that it was executed by her husband in excess of the powers given to him under his power of attorney fifth that it was executed as the result of collusion between the bank and the defendant Jean M. Poizat, for the purpose of making this defendant liable for the obligation of a third person. That as to the mortgage: First, it was executed to secure a void obligation; second, it does not guarantee any loan made to this defendant; third, it was executed without the express marital consent which the law requires; fourth, it was executed through collusion. That if the judgment is not set aside, the defendant will suffer irreparable injury; that through surprise and negligence for which she was not responsible, this defendant was prevented from defending herself in this action; that this is a case which comes under section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure. She prays that the judgment be annulled and set aside and the case be reopened, and that she be permitted to file an answer, and that the case be tried on its merit, and that a final judgment be rendered, absolving her from all liability. The motion was based upon, and supported by, the affidavit of the defendant wife, to which was attached a large number of exhibits all of which tended to support the motion. After counter showings by the bank and the Dominican Fathers and the arguments of respective counsel, the motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied. A motion for a reconsideration was the made, and the motion of the defendants file an answer and make a defense was again denied. The defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas appeals, assigning the following errors: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library PART I \"AS TO THE JURISDICTION \"I. The lower court erred in holding that it had acquired jurisdiction on the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, \"(1)\tThere having been no personal service of the summons on her in the manner required by section 396 of the Code of the Civil Procedure, she being absent from the Philippine Islands at the time of the filing of the complaint and of the issuance of the summons in this case, and a resident of Paris, France, where she had lived permanently and continuously for fifteen years prior thereto, and \"(2)\tThere having been no service by publication in the manner required by section 398 of the Code of the Civil Procedure. \"II. The lower court erred in considering that in a case where the wife is the only necessary party, service of the summons on the husband, at a place which is not ’the usual place of residence’ of the wife and where the wife has never lived or resided, is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction on the person and property of the wife and to render judgment by default against her. \"III. The court erred in admitting and considering evidence, outside of the sheriff’s return, of the fact that the husband of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas was her attorney in fact with power to appear for the defendant in court. \"IV. The court erred in holding that the non-appearance of an agent of the defendant when service of the summons has been made on him not as the agent of the defendant but in other capacity, will entitle the plaintiff who misstated the material jurisdictional facts of the complaint to a judgment by default against the principal. \"V. The lower erred in refusing to vacate a judgment by default against the defendant against the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas rendered on a defective summons, served in a manner not provided for by the law, and in a case where the complaint shows that plaintiff has no right of action. \"PART II \"AS TO THE MERITS OF THE DEFENSE \"I. The lower court erred, with abuse of discretion, in holding that the negligence, if any, of J.M. Poizat in not appearing on behalf of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, can be imputed to this defendant, without redress, and to the advantage of the plaintiff bank who in collusion with said J.M. Poizat caused the latter to contract beyond the scope of his powers as agent of this defendant the obligation which is the subject matter of this case. \"II. The lower court erred in holding that the belief on the part of J.M. Poizat that other was no defense against the claim of the plaintiff on an obligation contracted by said J.M. Poizat apparently as agent of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, by in truth beyond the scope of his authority, and with knowledge in the part if the plaintiff bank that he was so acting beyond his powers, was such an error as can be imputed to this defendant, and against which she can obtain no redress. \"III. The lower court erred in not holding that a principal is not liable for an obligation contracted by his agent beyond his power even when both the creditor and the agent believed that the latter was acting within the scope of his powers. \"IV. The court erred in holding that because the agent of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas had power to appear for her in court, his non-appearance could render third defendant liable to a judgment by default, when the record shows that there was no service of the summons in accordance with any of the forms of service provided by law. \"V. The lower court erred in holding that J.M. Poizat was summoned as agent of his wife, the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, and was, in that capacity, notified of all the decisions rendered in this case, there being nothing in the record to support the truth of such finding. \"VI. The lower court erred in holding that in contracting the obligations in favor of the plaintiff Bank of the Philippine Islands and of the defendant Orden de PP. Predicadores de la Provincia del Santisimo Rosario, the agent of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas acted within the scope of his powers. \"VII. The lower court erred in not holding that the plaintiff Bank of the Philippine Islands and the defendant Orden de PP. Predicadores de la Provincia del Santisimo Rosario had knowledge of the fact that J.M. Poizat in contracting the respective obligations in their favor, pretending to act as agent of the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, was acting beyond the scope of his powers as such agent. \"VIII. The lower court erred in making the following statement: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘It is however alleged, by the petitioner, that these loans were obtained to pay debts, of strangers. Even so, this would not render the loan obtained by the attorney in fact null and void. The circumstance that the agent used the money, borrowed by him within the scope of his powers, to purposes for which he was not authorized by his principal, may entitle the latter to demand from him the corresponding liability for the damages suffered, but it cannot prejudice the creditor and cause the nullity of the loan. But, even admitting that the money borrowed was used by Poizat to pay debts which did not belong to his principal, even then, he would have acted within his powers since his principal, together with the power to borrow money, and the payment of the debts of a stranger would amount to a loan made by the agent on behalf of his principal to the person or entity whose debt was paid with the money obtained from the creditors.’ \"IX. The lower court erred in applying to this case the principle involved in the case of Palanca v. Smith, Bell & co., 9 Phil., 131. \"X. The court erred in supplying from its own imagination facts which did not take place, of which there is no evidence in the record, and which the parties never claimed to have existed, and then draw the conclusion that if under those hypothetical facts the transaction between J.M. Poizat and the Bank of the Philippine Islands might have been legal, then the transaction as it actually took place was also legal. \"XI. The lower court erred in holding that defendant has not alleged any of the grounds enumerated in section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \"XII. The lower court erred in holding that this defendant-appellant has no meritorious defense against the Dominican Order and the Bank of the Philippine Islands. \"XIII. the lower court erred in taking into consideration Exhibit A appearing at pages 156-165 of the bill of exceptions. \"XIV. The lower court erred in denying the motion filed by this defendant-appellant. \"XV. The lower court has acted throughout these proceedings with a clear abuse of discretion.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT The defendant was formerly a clerk in the law firm of Wolfson & Wolfson, and, through the sheer force of his industry and ability, was admitted as a partner July 16, 1917, and continued as a member of the firm until November 15, 1921. Some time in 1921, he made a trip to the United States during which time he drew heavily on the firm, resulting in a large overdraft. The record is conclusive that up to that time there existed a warm and close personal friendship between the members of the firm, and that it was doing a very substantial business. Largely on account of the large overdraft of the firm in the bank incurred by the defendant upon his trip to the United States, a few days after his return the following agreement was signed by the respective partners: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Dissolution agreement \"Whereas the undersigned entered into a partnership agreement on July 16, 1917, and dissolved same by mutual consent on November 15, 1921: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The following settlement is agreed to — \"1. S. C. Schwarzkopf hereby sells his entire interest in the firm, including all participation of whatsoever kind and nature in and to any and all fees, to J.A. Wolfson, in consideration of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000), which amount shall forthwith be credited to S. C. Schwarzkopf’s overdraft: Provided, however, That in those unfinished cases which S.C. Schwarzkopf takes over for his future clients, said S. C. Schwarzkopf shall give due credit for the services rendered by the old firm prior to the date of dissolution (November 15, 1921) and when said S. C. Schwarzkopf collects the fees, he shall pay J.A. Wolfson for such prior services: And provided, further, That in the case of ’Fulton Iron Works Company v. Binalbagan Estates, Inc.,’ the future fees, whatever they may be, shall be divided fifty per centum (50%) to J. A. Wolfson and fifty per centum (50%) to S.C. Schwarzkopf; \"2. S.C. Schwarzkopf agrees, free of charge, to render such assistance as he may be called upon to render to wind up pending cases where his special knowledge of such cases is considered requisite. \"Manila, P. I., November 21, 1921. pp. \"JOS. N. WOLFSON (Sgd.) \"J. A. WOLFSON \"J. A. WOLFSON \"SIDNEY C. SCHWARZKOPF\" As a result of some sharp correspondence between them, the plaintiff brought this action in which he alleges the execution of the dissolution agreement, and that after deducting the P15,000 therein mentioned, there is a balance due and owing him of P17,772.62, with interest, and he prays for a corresponding judgment, and as a second cause of action asks for an accounting, and when made, that plaintiff have a further judgment for the balance that may be shown due and owing upon such accounting, and he also prays for judgment in a third cause of action for the further sum of P2,497.1, with interest from December 7, 1921, at the rate of 9 per cent per annum and costs. For answer the defendant makes a general and specific denial of all the material allegations of the complaint, except those which may be hereinafter admitted, and as a special defense, alleges in substance that all of the books and accounts of the firm were kept under the sole supervision of the plaintiff, and that the defendant relied upon the statements of account of the partnership as they were rendered and certified from time to time by the plaintiff. That previous to the execution of the dissolution agreement plaintiff represented and warranted to the defendant that the business assets of the firm would not exceed P50,000. That such representations were false and that plaintiff knew them to be false when made. That after the defendant discovered that they were false, he made a demand upon the plaintiff in writing for a written statement showing and disclosing the status of the business of the firm, and that he be given access to the books of account, for the purpose of having them checked and corrected. As a second special defense, defendant alleges that the firm books of account are in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff, and defendant prays for an accounting of all of the firm business from July 15, 1917, to November 15, 1921, and as a counterclaim defendant alleges that on November 15, 1921, defendant delivered to the plaintiff five bonds of the Manila Golf Club worth P500, with interest coupons attached, with the agreement that the plaintiff should retain the same for the defendant and collect any matured interest. That demand has been made and plaintiff has failed and refused to deliver the bonds to this defendant, and that they are now of the reasonable value of P580. Defendant prays for judgment that plaintiff take nothing by his complaint, and that on account of fraud, the dissolution partnership agreement be set aside and held for naught, and that plaintiff be required to render a just, true and accurate accounting of all of the firm business, and that pending the suit, he be restrained from removing any of the books of account, vouchers, and letters concerning the firm business from the firm office, and that this defendant have the right to examine the accounts of the firm business through an authorized public accountant. That upon the rendition of the accounts, defendant recover from plaintiff such an amount as may be found justly due and owing, and that defendant have and recover judgment for his Manila Golf Club bonds, or their value, P580, and costs. During the taking of testimony, different admissions were made by the respective parties, and the court later rendered judgment against the defendant upon the first cause of action for P17,772.62, with interest at 9 per cent from November 3, 1922, for P10,765.47, with legal interest from November 3, 1922, for P900 to be delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff whenever such amount is at defendant’s disposal. The defendant is further ordered to deliver to plaintiff stock certificate for P1,000 of the Isuan, Inc., and stock certificate for P500 of the Haight’s, Inc. The court denied the defendant’s right to accounting and rendered judgment in his favor and against the plaintiff for the delivery of the five Manila Golf Club bonds, or their value, P500. From this decision the plaintiff appeals, contending that the lower court erred in allowing him interest only from the date of the filing of his complaint. The defendant appeals, contending that the lower court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, and in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

      "STATEMENT By E. Womack, his next friend, it is alleged that Floyd Engle for about two months has been an inmate of the St. Luke’s Hospital in the City of Manila, where he was being treated for serious physical and mental disorders by Doctor N.M. Saleeby, the Director of the Hospital. That the defendant is a resident of the town of Tacloban, Province of Leyte, but at present is somewhere in the City of Manila. That on or about December 9, 1922, and in the hospital in the City of Manila, the defendant, through the aid of her friends and agents, induced and coerced Floyd Engle to go through some sort of a marriage ceremony with her, knowing at the time that he, Floyd Engle, was out of his mind and mentally deranged. That after the procuring of the certificate of the so-called marriage, the defendant forthwith returned to Tacloban, and endeavored to take possession of all of Engle’s property who was worth at least P50,000. That the conspiracy of the defendant to marry him was for the sole purpose of obtaining his property, and to defraud Engle and his legitimate heirs of their property. That it is proper that the court should appoint a guardian ad litem under the provisions of sections 116 and 117 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Wherefore, plaintiff prays that a special provisional guardian be appointed for Engle, and that a preliminary injunction issue against the defendant, restraining her from interfering issue against the defendant, restraining her from interfering with his property, and that the alleged marriage be declared void ab initio, and for costs, and such other and further relief as may be deemed just and equitable. For answer, the defendant made a general and specific denial of all the material allegations of the complaint, and as a special defense, alleges that for the last fourteen years she has been living maritally under the same roof with the plaintiff by whom she has had six children, the oldest of whom is twelve years of age. That on December 7th of last year, they were legally married. That in contracting the marriage, plaintiff was in the full enjoyment of all of his mental faculties, and that he entered into the contract freely, not only for the purpose of making his status and that of the defendant and her children legal, but to provide for her future in case of his death. That induced by his alleged friends, the plaintiff has caused and consented to the filing of the complaint, together with the application for the appointment of a guardian of his person and property, to make it appear that he is not of sound mind, when in truth and in fact he was then and is now in the full enjoyment of all of his mental faculties, and as a counterclaim, defendant alleges that when they began living together, plaintiff did not have any property, and that through her aid and assistance, he has amassed a considerable fortune, which at present is not less than P200,000. That the defendant has nothing with which to support herself and her children, and that the P80 which at present the plaintiff is giving the defendant is not sufficient for that purpose. That to properly support herself and the children and to employ an attorney to defend the suit, she requires a pension of P500 per month and the sum of P800 to be paid in advance on account of attorney’s fees, and the defendant prays that she be absolved from the complaint, that the court make an order requiring the plaintiff to make such allowances for her pension and attorney’s fees. Upon such issues, testimony was taken, and in a well written opinion the lower court found: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"That plaintiff at the time of said marriage ceremony in St. Luke’s Hospital was mentally deranged to such an extent that he was incapable of entering into the marriage contract or any other contract, and that for this reason the marriage ceremony was null and void. \"The court also finds that the defendant is not entitled to anything under her so-called counterclaim, and said counterclaim is hereby dismissed,\" and rendered a decree to the effect that the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant was \"illegal, null, and void ab initio, and without any legal effect as to plaintiff’s and defendant’s property rights, without costs to either party.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The defendant appeals, contending: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I.

      "STATEMENT On or about April 30, 1923, the plaintiff obtained a judgment against Henry W. Elser, who was then living, for the sum of P64,242.69, and for the foreclosure of a certain real mortgage property in Manila and the sale thereof to satisfy the judgment. Pending proceedings to appeal to this court from the judgment, Elser died June 18, 1923, and in the ordinary course of business C. W. Rosenstock was appointed as executor of his estate, and later the appeal was perfected by him as executor, and the judgment of the lower court of its origin for further proceedings, 1 Execution was issued, and on May 17, 1924, the mortgaged property was sold by the sheriff of Manila at public auction for P13,000. On June 2, 1924, the sale was duly confirmed and no appeal was taken from the order of confirmation. The plaintiff duly applied for and on July 25, 1924, obtained a deficiency judgment against the Elser estate for the sum of P68,700.88, with interest at 12 per cent per annum on P64,242.69 of said sum from July 8, 1924. After obtaining the deficiency judgment, the plaintiff at once applied to the Court of First Instance for the appointment of a committee on claims to examine and approve his claim against the Elser estate, of which the defendant was duly notified, and to which he duly objected. After a hearing the court appointed Jose de Guzman and P. D. Carman as commissioners. August 29, 1924, the plaintiff, based upon his deficiency judgment, filed with the commissioners his proof of claim, to which the defendant objected. September 19, 1924, the plaintiff’s claim was allowed in full by the commissioners, as a claim against the Elser estate, to which the defendant excepted. December 8, 1924, the defendant filed a motion for a reconsideration, which was denied, and from an order approving the allowance of the committee on claims, the defendant prosecutes this appeal, assigning the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The Court of First Instance erred and exceeded its jurisdiction in entering the order of August 21, 1924, reappointing the committee on claims and appraisals in the above-entitled proceeding, for the purpose of hearing and deciding the claim of Vicente E. Reyes against the estate. \"II. The Court of First Instance erred in entering the order of November 18, 1924, declaring the appeal of the executor from the decision of the committee allowing the claim of Vicente E. Reyes to have been presented out of time, and ordering the executor to pay the said claim of Vicente E. Reyes out of the funds of the estate.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff is a resident business man of the City of Manila. The defendant is a banking corporation, organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal place of business in Manila. Plaintiff alleges that on May 31, 1920, the American Trading Company of Australia drew a bill of exchange at Sydney upon the plaintiff as drawee for the sum of 5,050:0:0 pounds, payable to the order of the bank of New South Wales thirty days after sight. That the draft was duly endorsed to the order of the defendant, and was accepted by the plaintiff on June 21, 1920. About July 13, 1920, the plaintiff on the demand of the defendant paid to it the full amount of the bill of exchange, and in addition thereto, and through an error, paid to defendant as interest thereon the sum of P1,136.96. That no part of such money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant has been returned or refunded by the defendant, and that demand therefor was duly made February 9, 1921, and at other times. Like allegations, as to such interest charges on other drafts, are made in three other causes of action, and plaintiff prays for judgment against the defendant for P8,260.33, with interest on P5,132.67 from February 9, 1921, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, and on P3,127.66 from January 20, 1922, at such rate, and for costs. For answer the defendant makes a general and specific denial of all the material allegations of the complaint, and prays that the complaint be dismissed, with costs. The case was tried upon such issues, and the lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, with legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint, from which the defendant appeals and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"First. The trial judge erred in not declaring that at least the defendant bank is entitled to interest from the date on which its account with the National Bank of Scotland, Limited, London, was debited to the time on which the remittance of the payment made by plaintiff through the defendant bank in Manila arrived in London. \"Second. The trial judge erred in declaring that Mr. Ford’s testimony relative to the fact that Australian banks are controlled by the rules of the Association of Australian Banks which prohibit banks in Australia from operating directly with banks in foreign countries is hearsay evidence and therefore should not be admitted. \"Third. The trial judge erred in not dismissing the second, third and fourth causes of action in view of the plaintiff’s failure to prove the exact amount of the interest which is alleged to have been unduly charged by defendant. \"Fourth. The trial judge erred in not declaring that plaintiff had agreed to pay the full charge of interest made by defendant bank and that same is a legal charge of interest. \"Fifth. The trial judge erred in determining whether the charge of interest made by defendant bank is a proper charge of interest, when the real question for determination is whether plaintiff has agreed to pay this charge of interest, and whether said agreement is legal. \"Sixth. The trial judge erred in declaring that Mr. Ford’s testimony as to the similarity of the instant case with that of drafts drawn under a traveler’s letter of credit is a hocus pocus argument. \"Seventh. The trial judge erred in not permitting defendant’s counsel to establish by competent evidence that it was the usage of the defendant bank to charge interest on all drafts drawn upon foreign credits opened by the said bank. \"Eighth. The trial judge erred in not permitting defendant’s counsel to establish the custom of the banks of the Philippine Islands relative to the issue involved in the case. \"Ninth. The trial judge erred in declaring that the charge of interest made by defendant bank was paid by plaintiff through an error on his part.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT After the formal allegations, the petitioner alleges that it is the agent and operator of the steamship Venus which is used in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands. That between February 12 and September 16, 1924, and because there were no adequate facilities in the Philippine Islands, it caused certain heavy repairs and reconstruction work to be done in Hongkong at a cost of $300,004.90, Hongkong currency. That upon the return of the steamer to the Philippine waters, about October 20, 1924, the Insular Collector of Customs of Manila levied the customs duty payable on such repairs and reconstruction work at P159,960, and made a demand for its payment. That on October 24, 1924, the petitioner paid the money under protest, claiming that such repairs and work were exempt from the payment of customs duty under paragraph 200, section 8, and paragraph 348, section 11, of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909. That on October 31, 1924, and after an official hearing by him, the Insular Collector of Customs rendered a decision sustaining the protest, and ordered the refund of the money. That copies of the decision were immediately transmitted to the Secretary of Finance and to the defendant Auditor. It is then alleged that the Secretary of Finance failed, within fifteen days, to certify that, in his opinion, the decision ought to be revised by the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, or to order its removal, by reason of which the decision of the Collector of Customs has become and is now final and conclusive upon the Government of the Philippine Islands, as provided in section 1383 of the Administrative Code. That on November 6, 1924, the respondent, without any authority, addressed a letter to the Insular Collector of Customs asking him to reconsider his decision, and the Insular Collector of Customs denied the request, and affirmed his decision of October 31. That on November 26, 1924, the Insular Collector of Customs drew and signed a warrant for the refund of the import duty, and that the defendant wrongfully and unlawfully refused to do so, and still refuses to countersign the warrant. That the petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law, and it prays for a preemptory writ of mandamus directed to the defendant to countersign the warrant. For answer, the defendant admits the allegations made in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 of the petition, and denies all and singular allegations contained in paragraphs 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12, with the exception of those which in his further defense may be expressly admitted, and, as a special plea, alleges that the steamship Venus, owned and operated by the petitioner, is a steam vessel, whose tonnage, gross and net, at the time of the repairs, were 987.64 and 597.74, respectively. That prior to February, 1924, the steamship needed certain repairs. That, notwithstanding the existence and availability of adequate facilities in the Philippines, the petitioner caused the repairs to be made in Hongkong. That upon the arrival of the steamer, the Insular Collector of Customs of Manila made the assessment in question, which was paid under protest. That on October 31, 1924, the Insular Collector of Customs sustained the petitioner’s protest, and ordered the refund of the money, and that on the same day the defendant received a copy of the decision. That, notwithstanding the protest of the petitioner, the money in question, upon being paid to, and received by, the Collector of Customs, was covered and became a part of the general unappropriated funds, in accord with section 14, Chapter III, of Act No. 2935. It is then alleged \"that to meet refunds of customs duties or taxes erroneously and illegally collected by the Philippine Government, permanent annual appropriations are provided by Act No. 357, as amended by Act No. 1515.\" \"That the duty and responsibility to examine, audit, settle, and revise all accounts and claims for refund of customs duties rest solely and exclusively with the respondent Insular Auditor.\" That at once, upon the receipt of the decision of the Collector of Customs, the defendant, pursuant to the powers and duties invested in him by law, caused inquiries and investigations to be made, to ascertain and verify the correctness and veracity of the claim that the repairs could not have been made in the Philippine Islands, for the purpose of determining whether the refund by the Collector of Customs, or the payment for which credit is claimed was actually to be made for objects or purposes authorized by Act No. 357, as amended by Act No. 1515. That on or about November sixth, the defendant, being convinced that adequate facilities for the repairs were afforded, and conscious of the duties and responsibilities invested in him by the Jones Law, wrote a letter to the Insular Collector of Customs, requesting a reconsideration of his decision on the protest, on the ground that it was openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence in this case, and to the provisions of paragraph 200, section 8, and paragraph 348, section 11, of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909. That on November 7, the defendant wrote the Secretary of Finance furnishing him with a copy of the letter to the Collector of Customs, and requested the Secretary of Finance to have the decision of the Collector of Customs reviewed by the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, in the event that the collector refused to reconsider his decision. That on November 12 the defendant, having obtained additional evidence, as a result of his investigation and inquiry, reiterated to the Secretary of Finance his request to have the cause removed to the court for review, reminding him that the period within which the removal should be made would expire on November 14, 1924. That on November 14, 1924, the defendant addressed another letter to the Collector of Customs furnishing him with additional written proof, and again requesting him to review his decision. That his letters to the Secretary of Finance of November 7 and 12 and to the Collector of Customs of November 6 and 14 were never answered. That on November 26, 1924, the Collector of Customs presented to the defendant, for counter signature, the warrant in question in favor of the petitioner for the payment of the claim, which was styled for the payment of petitioner’s claim for the refund of the import duty, entry No. 316654-A, protest No. 14061. That on November 28, the defendant returned the warrant, and informed the Collector of Customs that no action could be taken until after the request of the respondent for a reconsideration of the decision had been passed upon by him. That on the same day, the Insular Collector of Customs returned defendant’s request for a reconsideration, \"stating that he finds no justification for reconsidering his decision of October 31, 1924, on said protest No. 14061.\" That at the time the petition was filed in this court, the defendant had not yet finally decided whether he would approve or countersign the warrant. As a further and separate defense, it is alleged that this court has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and that the petitioner has another plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. As a part of his answer, the defendant attached to the record a transcript of all the evidence taken by the Collector of Customs at the hearing on the protest and his decision upon such hearing on the protest and his decision upon such hearing, together with a copy of all the correspondence between the defendant and the Collector of Customs and the Secretary of Finance, and the defendant prays that the suit be dismissed. To this answer, the petitioner filed a general demurrer upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense, and that is the question now before this court.

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff is a partnership organized and existing under the laws of Great Britain, with a resident attorney-in-fact in the Philippine Islands. The defendant is a domestic partnership doing business in the City of Manila, and it is alleged that it is represented in London, England, by a duly appointed agent and attorney-in-fact. Plaintiff claims that under a written contract executed about April 1, 1921, known in the record as Exhibit A, it brought from the defendant 500 bales of Manila hemp grade J at 40 pounds less 1 per cent, equivalent in Philippine currency, to P364.66, per ton of 20 cwt. net landed weight. That pursuant to the contract, on May 31, 1921, the defendant shipped in two parcels from Manila to London, for delivery to plaintiff, the 500 bales of Manila hemp grade JDC/J, freight and f.p.a. insurance for the account of defendant, which hemp upon being weighed in London and deducting the tare, as provided for in the contract, amounted to 1182 cwt. — 2 qtrs. — 10 pounds equivalent to 59.13 tons of 20 cwt. net weight, and after deducting freight, commission, and insurance, as the contract provides, it had an invoice value of 1872 pounds — 6s 4d, equivalent to P17,241.48, Philippine currency. That at the time of the shipment, defendant drew upon plaintiff for P18,417.27, which draft the plaintiff paid by means of a letter of credit, thus leaving a balance due and owing the plaintiff of P1,175.79. That upon the arrival of the hemp in London, it was found that it was not in merchantable condition, and was not so when it was shipped from Manila. Therefore, arbitration was had under the provisions of clause 9 of the contract at a cost of P218.17 for the account of the defendant, which arbitration resulted in an allowance to plaintiff of a reduction in the price of P13,150.04, which arbitration and its findings were approved and accepted by the defendant. That after the shipment, defendant did not, without undue delay, provide plaintiff with Government graders’ certificates for the hemp, and by reason thereof, plaintiff was obliged to lighter and store 250 bales of it pending the arrival of the Government graders’ certificates at a cost of P135.37. That by reason of such acts, the defendant became indebted to the plaintiff in the sum, of P14,461.20, no part of which has been paid, except the sum of P11,687.87, which was the net value of 450 bales of Manila hemp grade J shipped by defendant to plaintiff during July, 1921, leaving a balance then due and owing from defendant to plaintiff, on its first cause of action, of P2,539.09, for which demand has been made and payment refused. Like allegations are made in a second cause of action, in which plaintiff claims P722.53, and in the third cause of action, for which it claims P3,526.71, and in the fourth cause of action P3,673.09. For answer the defendant made a general and specific denial of all of the material allegations made in the complaint. After the evidence was taken upon such issues, the lower court rendered judgment for the defendant, to which the plaintiff duly excepted and filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled. The plaintiff appeals and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The trial court erred in that, after finding that Messrs. H. E. Marchant and Francis Adams, during all the times material to the issues in this case, had been agents of the defendant in London for the purpose of selling and disposing of its hemp, the nature, character, and scope of such agency not appearing to have been limited, the trial court held that plaintiff was obliged to show such agency to have included within its scope matters necessary and incidental to the selling and disposing of defendant’s hemp in London. \"II. The trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff was bound to show before the court what evidence was before the arbitrators when they made up the award; that the action of the arbitrators was not binding upon the court and that the court was not bound to assume that such action was legal and just. \"III. The trial court erred in finding, in its final decision, that plaintiff was a British Corporation. \"IV. The trial court erred in finding in its final decision that it had sustained objections to certain portions of the deposition of the witness William Ernest Sibley, offered by plaintiff and couched in the following words: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘When the said 500 bales arrived in London, the plaintiffs found that the hemp was not in sound, dry condition in accordance with the clause 9 of the said contract (Exhibit W. E. S. 1). The arbitration which was duly held, resulted in an award being made by the arbitrators appointed by the plaintiffs and defendants, respectively, in the plaintiffs’ favor, whereby an allowance was made to the plaintiffs on the price of the said 500 bales, &c.’ B. E. 49. \"V. The trial court erred in finding that there was not sufficient evidence before the court to sustain the allegations of plaintiff.\" cralaw virtua1aw library \"VI.

      "STATEMENT October 14, 1910, Gregorio Yulo y Regalado, then 37 years of age, executed a mortgage to and in favor of the commercial house of Francisco Manzano Yap Tico, through its attorney-in-fact, Yap Eng Chong, on his sugar plantation, in consideration of which and at that time, the firm advanced Yulo the sum of P15,000. It was stipulated in the mortgage that the debt should draw interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and that the original debt, \"as well as such obligations as are herein contained,\" should become due and payable about the month of May, 1911. It was contemplated by both parties that the debt should be paid by Yulo by the delivery and sale of sugar produced on his plantation. This was followed by another like instrument of date November 24,1911, including some other property, in which it is recited that \"on account of the fact the fields of said haciendas were burned,\" and for the purpose of obtaining an extension of that debt up to 30, 1912, and to increase the credit of P15,000 by the amount of P8,000, Philippine currency, to attend to necessities of the haciendas Tongo and Napay,\" that the amount of the original debt should be increased to P23,000, P8,000 of which was then advanced, and that the total amount should draw interest at the rate of 10 per cent annum. It further appears that on October 22, 1922, there was a settlement between the parties in which it was agreed there was then due and owing the firm, the sum of P20,065.20. It also appears that the firm from time to time and in different amounts continued to advance money to Yulo, and that Yulo continued and at different times delivered sugar to the plaintiff; that the last money advanced to Yulo was on July 30, 1918; and that Yulo made his last delivery of sugar on May 30, 1915, amounting to P1,181.43. Apparently, such items are the last debits and credits between the parties. Yulo, having died, Jose Lopez Vito was appointed as administrator of his estate. In the ordinary course of business, Commissioners on claims were appointed to whom the firm duly presented its claim, and, for some unknown reason, no part of it was allowed. From that decision the firm appealed to the Court of First Instance where it sought to establish its claim against the estate for P72,496.48. At the trial before the court, the parties entered in the following stipulation: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The parties agree that the chits signed by Gregorio Yulo and Meliton Fernandez represent the amounts and goods taken by said Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the defendant does not admit nor recognize such items set forth in the statement of accounts which the plaintiff presents as Exhibit C, as are not evidenced by receipts or chits signed by Gregorio Yulo or Meliton Fernandez or Jose Yulo. \"That the defendant alleges as special defense in this case that plaintiff’s action has already prescribed as to the amounts shown in the statement of accounts in Exhibit C taken up to October 14, 1914; that the value of the sugar delivered after October 14, 1914, must be applied upon the payment of the amounts taken by Gregorio Yulo, evidenced by chits or receipts subsequent to October 14, 1914; that the document marked Exhibit A is one signed by Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the document marked Exhibit D is one signed by Gregorio Yulo on the date shown therein; that the receipts and chits marked Exhibits B-l to B-39 are the vouchers of the items shown in Exhibit C referred to in said receipts and chits; that Exhibit C is an abstract of the debit and credit of the account of the deceased Gregorio Yulo in the books of the plaintiff written in Chinese. \"That Exhibits E-1 to E-4 are the report of the commissioners of appraisal; the claim of the plaintiff filed with the commissioners; the notice of the hearing of the claim; and a receipt of the commissioners of the copies of chits B-1 to B-39. \"That the plaintiff has made demand on the defendant for the payment of the amount claimed in the complaint and said defendant has not paid the same. \"That the plaintiff corporation is the successor of F. M. Yap Tico. That with the facts herein agreed upon and the defense of the defendant, the parties submit the case to the court for judgment.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The lower court held that, as to all of that portion of plaintiff’s claim filed before the commissioners which was contracted prior to October 14, 1914, had prescribed under the provisions of paragraph 1, of section 43, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and upon that theory held that the proceeding in so far as it is founded upon Exhibits B-1 to B-24, inclusive, is barred by the statute of limitations, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the estate of Gregorio Yulo for the sum of P11,860.72, plus P10,222.84, with legal interest upon P10,222.84 from October 15, 1924, until the date of payment, together with the costs. Plaintiff appeals and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. The court erred in considering that the statute of limitations is applicable to this case, and that the right of action of plaintiff against the defendant for a certain portion of the indebtedness set out in the complaint has prescribed. \"2. The court erred in not allowing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on the principal after the date on which the decision was written in this case. \"3. The court erred in not rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of the principal demanded in the complaint.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendants P1,000 as actual damages, and P10,000 as punitive damages, for the publication of an alleged libelous article in a monthly paper known as Rural Credit, a copy of which is attached to, and made a part of, the complaint. Defendants filed a general demurrer to the complaint which was overruled, and then filed an answer, pleading the general issue, and alleging as a special defense the truth of the article, and that it was published in good motives and for justifiable ends. It was later amended in which it was alleged that the plaintiff is an illegal and fraudulent entity wrongfully and unlawfully simulating a mutual building and loan association. Upon such issues, the case was tried, and judgment was rendered against the defendant Prautch for punitive damages for P300, and the defendant Poblete for P100. The defendants filed a motion for a new trial which was overruled. Upon their appeal, they contend: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The lower court erred in not sustaining the second special defense of the appellants and in holding that the  appellee is a legal mutual building and loan association. \"II.

      "STATEMENT After the formal pleas, the petitioner alleges that on September 1, 1925, he was duly appointed a \"temporary clerk\" in the office of the Secretary, Philippine Senate, with an agreed compensation of P40 per month, as shown by the letter of appointment from the Secretary of the Senate, a copy of which is attached to the petition marked Exhibit A; that he took his oath of office and entered on the discharge of his duties as \"temporary clerk,\" and has performed them from that date to the present time; that from February 1 to 14, 1926, there is due and owing him P20 for and on account of his services as such clerk, for which amount a warrant was issued to and in his favor by the chairman of the committee on accounts of the Philippine Senate, which is attached to the petition marked Exhibit B; that it is the duty of the respondent to approve such warrant; but the said respondent, in violation of the clear legal rights of the petitioner, and of his, the said respondent’s plain duty in the premises, unjustly refused and still refuses to approve said warrant; that at the time said warrant was presented to the respondent for approval, there was a large amount of money in the Insular Treasury not otherwise appropriated by law and subject to be applied to the payment of said warrant; that petitioner does not have any plain, speedy or adequate remedy, and prays for a writ of mandamus against the Insular Auditor commanding him to sign the warrant. For answer, the respondent admits the allegations in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the petition, and specifically denies all other allegations, and, as a first special defense, alleges that this court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, and that the petitioner has another plain, speedy and adequate remedy. As a second special defense, the respondent then alleges that the appropriation for the petitioner is governed by the provisions of paragraph 2 under section 18 of Act No. 2935, in connection with item No. 120 of the Appropriation Act for 1925, and item No. 134 of the Appropriation Act for 1926, he being included among \"employees rendering service before, during and several days after a session;\" that the Legislature closed its last session on November 9, 1925; and that the petitioner was paid his salary up to and including January 31, 1926, which latter date was many more than \"several days after the close of a session;\" that for such reason, the respondent refused to sign the warrant, and for the further reason that the services of the petitioner and like employees have been unnecessary since February 1, 1926, for the reason that there have been one hundred and sixty-one more or less permanent employees on the payroll of the Senate; that on January 29, 1926, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Accounts was advised that the respondent would refuse the payment of such warrant; that on December 7th, such employees were duly notified that their services would dispensed with on or after January 1, 1926; that the present case is a test case, the decision of which will effect the status of forty-seven other like employees.

      "STATEMENT Plaintiff, Rio y Olabarrieta, is a copartnership organized and existing under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the City of Manila. The defendant, Yu Tec & Co., Inc., is a domestic corporation, with its office in the City of Manila, and the defendant Calvin is of age and a resident of Manila. Plaintiff alleges that on December 5, 1923, the defendant company, which was then a limited partnership, authorized its agent, J. V. Molina, to find a purchaser or a lessee of a tract of land belonging to it, situate on Calle Velasquez, Tondo, City of Manila, which has an area of 20,000 square meters and which is particularly described in the complaint. That within the time granted its agent found a purchaser in the name of the plaintiff which offered to purchase the land for the sum of P40,000, and that Molina, as its agent, made known its offer to the defendant company which refused to accept it, but did offer to sell the land for P42,000, which P7,000 was to be paid on the signing of the deed, and the balance within two years, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, P10,000 at the end of the first year, and the remaining P25,000 at the end of the second year all to be secured by a first mortgage. That within the period fixed by the defendant company, the offer of P42,000 was accepted by the plaintiff which was then and there are ready and willing to sign the necessary papers and to make the first payment of P7,000. That from one excuse or another, the defendant company refused to carry out the agreement. That the defendant Calvin, with full knowledge of all the facts and within the specified period, fraudulently conspiring with the defendant company, entered into a contract on June 9, 1924, by which he purchased the property from the company. That by reason plaintiff was damaged in the sum of P12,000, and prays for a decree that the sale to Calvin be declared null and void, and ordering the defendant company to comply with the contract, and to execute a deed to the plaintiff, and ordering it to pay the sum of @12,000 as damages, together with costs. For answer the defendant company denies all of the material allegations of the complaint, and as a further and separate answer alleges that the alleged agreement set out in the complaint was not made or created by any deed of conveyance or other instrument in writing subscribed by the defendant or its authorized agent. For answer the defendant Calvin made a general and specific denial of all of the material allegations of the complaint. After a trial upon such issues, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant corporation for P6,994.65, with legal interest from the filing of the complaint and costs, and denied the prayer of the plaintiff for the execution to it of a deed of the property by the defendant corporation, and dismissed the action as to the defendant Calvin. From that judgment, the plaintiff appeals and makes the following assignment of error: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The lower court erred in holding that had the plaintiff acquired the land in question, it would at all events have paid to the defendant interest on the remaining P35,000 for two years at the rate of 8 per cent per annum and that the amount of said interest must be deducted from the damages awarded the plaintiff.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The defendant Yu Tec appeals and contends that the court erred: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"(1)\tIn denying the motion to strike out the testimony of Tan Lee Wan. \"(2)\tIn denying the motion to strike out the testimony of Juan V.

      "STATEMENT This is an appeal by Leopoldo Hormillosa and \"Viuda de Tan Toco\" from an order of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, granting a motion of the Director of Forestry for the reopening of the above-entitled case with respect to lot No. 1156. The proceeding were initiated by the Director of Lands under Act No. 2259, known as the Cadastral Act. On November 28, 1920, the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros set the dace to be heard on February 21, 1921, in the municipality of Cadiz, of that province. December 8, 1920, the provincial fiscal on behalf of the Bureau of Forestry filed an opposition to the registration alleging that lot No. 1156 and other therein named were within the proposed \"Northern Negros Forest Reservation,\" and, for that reason, that such lands were the property of the Government of the United States and under the administration of the Government of the Philippine Islands. About March 7, 1921, Leopoldo Hormillosa filed an answer in which he claimed to be the owner of lot of No. 1156 with its improvements. In February, 1921, Uvilfredo Duyuñgan, on behalf of the heirs of Custodio Duyuñgan, filed an answer also claiming the ownership of that lot and the improvements. The respective answers were duly noted by the cadastral attorney, with the words \"contested by the Bureau of Forestry\" and \"contested by the heirs of Custodio Duyuñgan and the Insular Government.\" April 22, 1921, Hormillosa, the Duyuñgan heirs and Lao Sanco filed a motion for the subdivision of lot No. 1156, which was granted on June 15, 1921, and the surveyor was order to designated the subdivisions as lots Nos. 1156-A, 1156-B, and 1156-C.

Lot No. 1156-B with its improvements to Uvilfredo Duyuñgan and his coheirs, subject to a right of way in factor of the \"Negros Philippine Lumber Co.,\" and lot No. 1156-C with its improvements to Lao Sangco. May 27, 1924, the provincial fiscal, on behalf of the Bureau of Forestry, filed a motion to reopen the case as those particular lots, alleging in substance that the decision of the court had been obtained through fraud and in bad faith. Objections were filed to the granting of the motion, and after a hearing thereon, it was ordered that the case be reopened, to which Leopoldo Hormillosa and \"Viuda de Tan Toco\" duly excepted and moved for a rehearing, which was denied, from which they appeal and assign the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The trial court erred in not holding that on December 8, 1921, the decree of registration of the land in question was entered within the meaning of section 38 of Act No. 496; and that, no fraud having been proven, and no petition for a review having been filed within one year from the entry of said decree, the same became irrevocable. \"II.

      "STATEMENT The plaintiff, F W. Maage, is a resident of Talisay, Occidental Negros. The Sarangani Cattle Co., Inc., is a domestic corporation, with its principal office in the same place. January 1, 1922, the defendant entered into a written contract of employment with the Cattle Company to be its general manager for a period of five years, and was placed in charge of the hacienda of the company at Glan, Cotabato. It is then alleged that after the signing of the contract, the defendant entered into an agreement with Maage to sell all of his stock and interest in the company, by reason of which his contract with the company should be cancelled. Maage is one of the principal stockholders of the corporation, and that he paid to the defendant the purchase price in full of all of defendant’s interest in the corporation in consideration of which, defendant was to surrender his contract with the company. That at the time of the making of this contract, it was agreed that the defendant should temporarily remain in the employ of the company until the trial of a criminal case which was then pending against him for the crime of murder. That in many and different ways, the defendant has violated the terms of his original contract. That on September 1, 1923, and after defendant’s trial in the criminal charge, he was notified by the plaintiff that his services were no longer required, and that should be should surrender his position and quit the premises of the company, which he refused to do. That plaintiffs are informed and believe that the defendant is about to destroy certain property now in his possession and otherwise to commit a nuisance. That by reason of defendant’s acts, plaintiffs were damaged in the sum of P5,000, for which amount, plaintiffs pray judgment, and that a preliminary injunction be issued restraining him from interfering with plaintiffs’ property, and for a cancellation of the contract in question. For answer the defendant made a general and specific denial of all of the material allegations of the complaint and as a counterclaim alleges the execution of the original contract for the period of five years with a salary of P600 per month for the first three years, P700 a month for the remaining two, and a bonus of P1 per head on all cattle branded by the company after the first three years. That there is due from the plaintiff, Cattle Company, to the defendant for and on account of earned salary P4,631.14, which the company refused to pay. As a second counter-claim, defendant alleges that he was arbitrarily and without reason discharged in violation of his contract, to his damage in the amount of his salary from November 30, 1923, to December 31, 1926, in the sum of P24,000, and for a bonus of P5,000, for all of which he prays a corresponding judgment against the Cattle Company. For reply to the new matter alleged, plaintiffs made a general and specific denial. Upon such issues the lower court found as a fact that the dismissal of the defendant was justified and sustained by the evidence, and that plaintiffs had failed to prove any damages, and rendered a corresponding judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. It also rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for the amount of P4,631.14 for and on account of salary earned by the defendant, and for which he had not been paid, and dismissed his second counterclaim for want of proof. From that judgment, plaintiffs appeal and assign the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. The court erred in rendering judgment against the plaintiffs and in favor of the defendant for the sum of P4631.14, and in not rendering judgment against the defendant in favor of plaintiffs for P681.07, the amount of defendant’s overdraft. \"2. The court erred in not rendering judgment against the defendant in favor of plaintiffs for damages to the extent of P5,000. \"3. The court erred in not admitting all of plaintiffs’ depositions.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The defendant appeals and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The lower court erred in declaring that the dismissal of the defendant W. H. Anderson by F. W. Maage was justified. \"II. The lower court erred in declaring that the defendant abandoned his work with the Sarangani Cattle Co., Inc., and went to Australia for the purpose of doing some work for other people and not for the company. \"III. The lower court erred in not awarding to defendant damages as alleged and prayed for in his second counter-claim. \"IV. The lower court erred in not granting the new trial requested by the defendant.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "The plaintiff seeks to recover of the defendants the payment of P2,113.17, the amount of the writ of execution issued in his favor, which he could not enforce because the defendants unjustifiedly released the attached property of the judgment debtor Santa Singh, plus the amount of P1,000 for expenses incurred by the plaintiff by reason of his stay in Samar on the occasion of the enforcement of the execution which was pot carried out. The defendants — provincial Sheriff Juan Sulse and Deputy Sheriff Bernardo Arteche — filed their answers praying for the reasons stated first, that the case be dismissed with costs against the plaintiff, and, second, that they be absolved from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff. The other defendant Francisco D. Colinares was declared in default for not having appeared, notwithstanding the fact that he was duly summoned. The lower court rendered judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff M. Singh, jointly and severally the sum of P4,467.24 by way of damages, with legal interest from the date of the judgment, October 31, 1925, and the costs. Of the two defendants Juan Sulse and Bernardo Arteche, only the latter appealed, and his counsel now alleges that the lower court erred: (a) In not absolving the defendant Arteche from the complaint, he being not legally responsible for the due compliance with a writ of execution inasmuch as he is a mere deputy sheriff, but the provincial sheriff to whom the said orders were directed; (b) in not absolving the defendant Arteche inasmuch as: (1) His intervention in the proceeding in regard to the two executions was fully in accordance with the law and his sound discretion; (2) of the plaintiff’s sureties named to indemnify the intervenors, some withdrew their bonds while others were delinquent and insolvent, and (c) in sentencing the defendant Arteche to pay, jointly and severally, the amount of P4,467.24 as damages. The facts established by the evidence are stated by the Honorable Vicente Nepomuceno, who tried the case, in the following manner: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"On June 20, 1924, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued a writ of execution (Exhibit A) upon the judgment rendered in civil case No. 20222, entitled M. Singh v. J. R. Sarda and Santa Singh, for the amount of P2,171.62 which writ of execution was delivered by M. Singh to D. Juan Sulse, provincial sheriff of Samar, to whom it was directed and which was later transmitted to his deputy in Basey, Mr. Francisco D. Colinares who, on July 9, 1924 complying with said writ, attached the property set forth in Exhibit B, which is the list of Santa Singh’s property attached, issued, certified and signed by said Francisco Colinares. According to this list, some lumber and 25 carabaos were attached. \"On July 12, 1924, it was announced (Exhibit C) that on the 17th of that month the property seized from Santa Singh, Roman Echegurin, Bruno Echegurin and Miguel Salangue filed third party claims, asserting titled to the lumber and carabaos attached by Colinares and set forth in Exhibit B. (See Exhibits F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and LL.) Marcelo Abesamis was the one who claimed the carabaos, alleging in his claim Exhibit H that the same had been transferred to him on January 29, 1924. \"Mr. Francisco Colinares, in his letters (Exhibits D and E) addressed to Mr. M. Singh on July 15 and 16, 1924, informed the latter of the third party claims of Abesamis and Chapman, advising him to file an indemnity bond in his favor, otherwise the property levied upon would be released and returned to the claimants. Due to these claims the sale at public auction announced in Exhibit C was postponed. \"As a result of Mr. Colinares’ warning, Mr. M. Singh complied with the conditions required of him by having Mariano Cordero and Antonio Abad execute a bond (Exhibit 10) in favor of deputy sheriff Francisco Colinares who, on July 17, 1924, in a letter (Exhibit M) addressed to Mr. M. Singh, stated that he had received and approved the bond which was sent to him. \"Notwithstanding the approval of the bond (Exhibit 10) by deputy sheriff Colinares, on July 18, 1924 he addressed a letter (Exhibit O) to M. Singh informing him that the sureties Mariano Cordero and Antonio Abad had withdrawn the bond executed by them the day before and warning him that if he did not file a new indemnity bond by the 21st of said month, the property would be released from attachment. The letter of the sureties Cordero and Abad withdrawing their bond is dated July 18, 1924 and is marked Exhibits N and 11. \"Mr. M. Singh complied with the conditions required of him and on July 18, 1924, the sureties Lucio Go-Juaco and Ruperto Abelino executed a new bond (Exhibit 12) in favor of Mr. Colinares, as deputy sheriff, which bond was received, accepted and approved by him, according to his certificate Exhibit P issued on July 19, 1924. \"On July 28, 1924, however, deputy sheriff Colinares wrote a letter (Exhibit 15) to Mr. M. Singh to the effect that Lucio Fernando Go-Juaco being delinquent, the bond was disapproved. (See Exhibits 13 and 14.) In view of this, new bonds in the amount of P7,500 were executed on August 6, 1924 by Elias Andrade and Isaac Aquino, and Ruperto Avelino and Placido Enerlan in favor of the said deputy sheriff, marked Exhibits S and T and accompanied by certificates, Exhibits W, X and Z, which show that the sureties Placido Enerlan, Elias Andrade and Isaac Aquino were not delinquent in the payment of taxes on the property on that date. \"According to the announcements, Exhibits 3 and 4, the public auction sale of the attached property was postponed to August 14th and was again postponed to August 16, 1924. \"The bonds (Exhibits S and T, marked also 18 an 20) were delivered by Mr. M. Singh to deputy sheriff Bernardo Arteche at Tacloban on August 14, 1924 and transmitted by him to the deputy sheriff Colinares at Basey, according to the letter (Exhibit AA) addressed by Arteche to Mr. Singh on the 15th of the same month. At the foot of said letter there appears a note by said deputy sheriff Arteche which reads: ’You may leave this case and take care of your family in Manila who, according to a telegram, are sick.’ This was on August 15th, just prior to the date fixed in the announcement of the sale (Exhibit 3). \"Mr. Singh relying upon the statement of deputy sheriff Arteche and the certificates (Exhibits U, X and Z), left Tacloban for Manila; but while in this city he received a telegram (Exhibit BB) from the provincial sheriff of Samar at Catbalogan, dated August 21, 1924, which read: ’Execution against Santa Singh not levied. Two of your sureties withdrew and the other two are insolvent.’ Two facts may be noted in this telegram, to wit: (a) That it was sent on August 21st, or five days after the date fixed for the sale at public auction (Exhibit 3), and (b) that no time was fixed within which the plaintiff might file another indemnity bond. The defendants presented Exhibits 16, 17, and 19, which bear the dates of August 15 and 16, 1924, but it appears that although Exhibit 19 is dated August 16th, it was ratified by Andrade and Aquino on September 10, 1925. \"On August 22, 1924, that is, immediately after Mr. M. Singh received the telegram (Exhibit BB), his attorney sent a telegram (Exhibit GG) to the provincial sheriff of Samar at Catbalogan, reading as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Wish to inform you of following irregularities deputy sheriff Basey. After requiring my client Singh to file indemnity bonds four times and approving same he suspended execution alleging withdrawal of sureties. Call your attention once obligation ratified sureties cannot withdraw civil cases. I accuse deputy sheriff having understanding with judgment debtors. Request immediate ordering sale public auction. Request answer.’ \"Not having received an answer to the telegram Exhibit GG, Attorney Sotto, who represented Mr. M. Singh, on August 26, 1924 sent another telegram, (Exhibit GG-1) to the governor and Sheriff ex-oficio at Catbalogan, Samar reading as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Request definite action prevent deputy sheriff Basey releasing property attached Singh case. \"On August 27, 1924, the provincial sheriff of Samar answered Attorney Sotto by telegram (Exhibit GG-2). as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Indemnity bond filed judgment creditor not yet approved sheriff because sureties not solvent whose property have encumbrances. New bond necessary to my satisfaction.’ \"On the same day, that is on August 27, 1924, Attorney Sotto sent another telegram (Exhibit GG-3), which read: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Request you reduce four thousand bond. Will send affidavit of solvency together with assessment by mail. If you desire other requirements advise us. We await answer.’ \"As day after day passed without having received a reply Attorney Sotto, on September 2, 1924, sent another telegram (Exhibit GG-4), to the provincial sheriff of Samar, which read: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Request answer last telegram asking reduction of bond and other information. Request prevent release of property attached.’ \"On September 3, 1924, the provincial sheriff of Samar wired Attorney Sotto (Exhibit GG-5) as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Am awaiting information Basey as to amount of property attached to decide your petition.’ \"On September 18, 1924, Attorney Sotto sent another telegram (Exhibit GG-6) to the governor and provincial sheriff of Samar which literally read: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Please fix amount and other conditions of bond to definitely levy execution Singh. We request your intervention to prevent release of property attached by sheriff Basey.’ \"The following day, that is on September 19, 1924, the said provincial sheriff wired (Exhibit GG-7 and Exhibit HH) Attorney Sotto as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Special deputy left for Basey to prevent release of property attached and when he returns I will send amount and other conditions of bond by mail.’ \"On October 9, 1924, Attorney Vicente So to sent a telegram to the provincial sheriff of Samar (Exhibit GG 8) reading: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘We have not received as yet letter promised as to amount and other conditions of indemnity bond Singh case notwithstanding a month has elapsed. Request immediate definite action.’ \"Later, the attorney for Mr. Singh received a letter (Exhibit CC) from governor and provincial sheriff Juan Sulse, dated Catbalogan, Samar, October 14th, which read as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Third party claims were duly presented to the provincial sheriff on the pieces of lumber upon which execution was levied by the special deputy sheriff of Basey, Samar, by virtue of the writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in civil case No. 20222, M. Singh, Plaintiff , v. J. R. Sarda and Santa Singh, Defendants , and for the protection of the sheriff and in order to sell them at public auction, the amount of the bond, as security, is hereby fixed at six thousand pesos (P6,000) in cash or its equivalent in a collectable check to be deposited in a duly accredited bank to avoid delay in case of indemnity. \"In view of this requirement of provincial sheriff Juan Sulse, on October 25, 1924, Attorney Sotto sent him a telegram (Exhibit GG-9) requesting reconsideration of the letter (Exhibit CC) in the sense that, instead of a cash bond or a check that might be easily collected, a personal bond for the amount of P6,000 be accepted. \"No answer having been received, on November 4, 1924, Attorney Sotto sent another telegram (Exhibit GG-10) to the governor and provincial sheriff of Samar making the following request: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Request you take action immediately on petition set forth in previous telegram offering personal bond in Singh case.’ \"On November 5, 1924, the provincial sheriff of Samar sent Attorney Vicente Sotto the following telegram (Exhibit GG-11): jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"‘Accept personal bond for six thousand pesos with solvent sureties whose property must be free from all liens and encumbrances.’ \"As required by this telegram, the herein plaintiff M. Singh on November 13, 1924, gave an indemnity bond (Exhibit DD) in the City of Manila for the amount of P6,000 in favor of the provincial sheriff of Samar. The bond referred to (Exhibit DD) was received and approved by the sheriff of Samar, Mr. Juan Sulse.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Commenting on the above statement of facts, the judge of the lower court says: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"As will be seen, Mr. M. Singh and his attorney, Mr. Sotto, did everything that was necessary to carry out the writ of execution, but all their efforts were in vain, because the herein defendants did nothing from that time until this date towards carrying out and duly enforcing said writ of execution, it positively appearing that all of the property levied upon by virtue of the writ of execution issued on June 20, 1924 had disappeared. (Exhibits A and B.) \"The judgment creditor M. Singh not desiring that there should be any pretext and to avoid delay in carrying out the execution, on August 18, 1924, that is, before the expiration of sixty days provided by law, secured another writ of attachment (Exhibit JJ), which was received in due time. This second writ was unnecessary for the reason that the first writ had already been complied with and his act in securing it is the best proof that Mr. M. Singh had not been negligent and that he devoted all of his attention and exerted all his efforts towards carrying out the writ of execution. \"Deputy sheriff Bernardo Arteche admits having attached the property found in the forest belonging to Santa Singh consisting of lumber of the approximate value of P4,000, but gold lumber has not been sold, neither has its sale been announced nor does he knew where it can be found. The excuse given by deputy sheriff Arteche for this irregularity is that, according to him, Mr. Singh has neither paid the sheriff’s fees nor has he appeared in that place to attend the public auction sale. Mr. Arteche says that Mr. Juan Sulse wrote a letter (Exhibit 24) to Mr. Singh regarding this matter Mr. Singh denies having received the original of Exhibit 24 and the court believes that it really was never sent to Mr. Singh, and the auction sale could not be held for the simple reason that no date was fixed for the sale, nor was the announcement of the sale at public auction advertised. And as to the sheriff’s fees for that execution, Exhibit N contradicts Arteche and his codefendants. \"The excuse now given by the defendants in regard to the disappearance of the lumber first attached (Exhibit B) is that, because of the third party claims and the failure to file a bond with solvent sureties, ,said lumber was released from attachment. But, in the opinion of the court, this is a mere pretext without any foundation, because, if it were true that the said lumber in Exhibit B had been released from attachment the provincial sheriff would not have required the filing of a bond for P6,000 as per his telegram (Exhibit G-11), nor would he have accepted and approved the bond Exhibit DD. These telegrams and bond are dated November 5 and 13, 1924, respectively, and it is to be presumed that on said dates the property set forth in Exhibit B bad not yet been released from the attachment. \"The plaintiff Mr. M. Singh says that the public auction sale of the attached property belonging to Santa Singh was carried out because the herein defendant conspired with the sureties. The plaintiff, Mr. M. Singh, could not, as is natural, present direct evidence of the alleged conspiracy of the defendants with the judgment debtors and the sureties but there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish the existence of a conspiracy or, at least, bad faith on the part of the defendant-sheriffs, for the following reasons: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Juan Sulse and his deputies Bernardo Arteche and Francisco Colinares now pretend and state in Exhibits 22 and 24 that the 25 carabaos were not attached by virtue of the first writ of execution; but this is untrue as these carabaos appear among the attached property in Exhibit B, the words \"25 carabaos\" in said document having been written and initialed by Francisco Colinares; and it furthermore appears in Exhibit H that said carabaos were claimed by Marcelo Abesamis who alleged that they had been transferred to him by Santa Singh on January 29, 1920, from which date he has had them in his possession, which is another falsehood because, according to the certificate of the deputy treasurer (Exhibit EE), said carabaos were transferred to Marcelo Abesamis by Santa Singh on July 14, 1924, that is, after they had been attached. \"Here it is seen that the defendants lied in stating that the carabaos were not attached, when it can logically be deduced from the documents mentioned, Exhibits B and H that they were attached and later claimed by Abesamis, pretending to be the owner by virtue of the supposed said transfer evidenced by Exhibit EE.\" cralaw virtua1aw library And the trial judge concludes: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"There is no doubt that the failure to carry out the writ of execution of the judgment rendered in civil case No. 20222 of the Court of First Instance of Manila was due to the conspiracy between the defendant sheriffs and Santa Singh in connivance with the sureties and other persons; that the reproachable conduct of the judicial functionaries Sulse, Colinares and Arteche has caused considerable damage to Mr. M. Singh; that the gross amount of the damages consists of the following sums: The amount of the writ of execution, Exhibit A, which is P1,871.74 (P1,455.62 plus P500 plus P216.12, minus P300); the amount of P12.50 which Mr. M. Singh paid on account of sheriff’s fees; the amount of P135 for freight on the launch which transported the property set forth in Exhibit B; the amount of P200 for trips made by the plaintiff between Tacloban, Calbayog and Catbalogan and vice versa to take the defendant Arteche to Basey, Samar; the amount of P1,400 for premiums on the various bonds which were required of the plaintiff; the sum of P800 for plaintiff’s Attorney’s fees in the present case, plus P48 the cost of the various telegrams sent by the plaintiff and his attorney in connection with the writ of execution (see Exhibit FF composed of various receipts), total P4,467.24. \"It is indisputable that the deputies Colinares and Arteche are liable for their illegal acts and that the provincial sheriff Mr. Sulse is liable, jointly and severally, with his deputies for his acts and for those of his deputies.\" cralaw virtua1aw library We have reviewed the record before us and find that the assignments of error by the appellant are groundless. We are of the opinion that the finding of facts arrived at by the lower court is duly supported by the evidence, and that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with law. The appellant alleges that as a mere deputy sheriff he is not liable for the enforcement of the writs of execution which were directed to the provincial sheriff. This allegation is untenable Although, under the rule that the official default of a deputy is chargeable to the sheriff, an action is properly brought against the sheriff for such default yet an action may be brought against the sheriff and his deputy for active malfeasance of said deputy, such action being against him as a wrongdoer and not in his capacity as deputy. (35 Cyc., 1788.) And this rule is applicable to the case at bar because, according to the evidence, the appellant, by his actions and omissions as held by the lower court, contributed in a certain degree to the non-enforcement of the writ of execution to the prejudice of the judgment creditor-appellee.

      "STATEMENT The original complaint in this case was filed on March 10,1924, to recover P292,000 evidenced by a promissory note dated December 29, 1921, payable one year after date, with interest at 9 per cent per annum. The note was secured by a chattel mortgage on the steamers Roger Poizat and Gabrielle Poizat, with the machinery and materials and certain merchandise belonging to the Poizat Vegetable Oil Mills. Also a certain real mortgage on property in the City of Manila then subject to a prior mortgage in favor of the Dominican Fathers, which was made a party defendant. The mortgages in question were executed and acknowledged on the date of the note. April 24, 1924, the Dominican Fathers appeared and asked to have it mortgage foreclose. In that action Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas and her husband, J. M. Poizat, were made defendants, and on May 3, 1924, they were declared in default, and judgment was rendered against them for want of an answer. For the first time, and on August 26, 1924, Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas, to whom we will hereafter refer as the appellee, personally appeared and filed a motion, setting out certain alleged facts in which she asked to have the default and judgment against her set aside and vacated, with a right to appear and defend the cause of action alleged in the complaint on the merits. Her motion was denied by the lower court, and on appeal, this court reversed that decision, with leave for her to file in answer, and to have the case tried on its merits, and for such and further proceedings as are not inconsistent with the opinion of this court. On that appeal, the case was known here as G.R. No. 23181, and the decision, which was the majority opinion, was promulgated on March 16, 1925. 1 Upon the return of the case to the lower court, the appellee here then filed her answer, to which the plaintiff filed a further and separate defense, in which it was alleged that the appellee and her attorney, Mr. Antonio M. Opisso, ratified and confirmed the execution by J. M. Poizat, as the agent of the appellee in the execution, of the note and mortgages sued on in this case, and that they recognized the obligations arising therefrom, and that said ratification, confirmation and acknowledgment were made by the appellee and her attorney with full and accurate knowledge of the facts which gave rise to the execution of the note and mortgages and the rendition of the judgment. To such allegations, the appellee made a general and specific denial. A trial was then had in the lower court based upon the issues made in the original and amended complaint, the answer filed by the appellee, and plaintiff’s further and separate defense to such answer, and the appellee’s reply thereto, and the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the appellee, and absolved her from all liability arising from, or growing out of, the note and mortgages in question. From that decision, the plaintiff made and perfected its appeal, and assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. The trial court erred in declaring that the defendant and her counsel, Antonio M. Opisso, did not have full knowledge of facts when they ratified and confirmed the promissory note and mortgage here involved. \"II. The trial court erred in declaring that the promissory note here involved does not evidence a loan to the defendant. \"III. The trial court erred in declaring that the power of attorney Exhibit D, does not authorize the agent to lend d his principal’s credit to a partnership wherein both principal and agent are equally interested. \"IV. The trial court erred in declaring null and void as to the defendant Gabriela Andrea de Coster y Roxas the promissory note and mortgage executed in favor of the plaintiff bank.\" cralaw virtua1aw library JOHNS, J. :\n",

      "STATEMENT November 23, 1922, the defendant Haskell executed a real mortgage to and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P 20,000 on a tract of land situate in the municipality of Magdalena, Province of Laguna, P15,000 of which was paid to him by the plaintiff at the time of the execution of the mortgage, in which it was provided that the remaining P5,000 was to be paid as soon as possible. The mortgage provided that the money should be repaid within one year from the date of its execution, with interest on P15,000 from date at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, and with like interest on the remaining P5,000 from the date of its payment to the defendant. It further provided that in a case a suit or action was brought to enforce collection that the defendant should pay the further sum of 10 per cent as attorney’s fees upon the amount then due and owing. April 28, 1923, the defendant Haskell executed to the plaintiff a second mortgage on the same property for P12,000, the receipt of which was acknowledged and which, by the terms of the mortgage, was made due and payable November 23, 1923, with like interest thereon from date and with a similar provision as to attorney’s fees. After the execution of the two mortgages, the defendant Haskell sold and conveyed the real property therein described to the defendant, the Magdalena Coconut Company Inc., and in and by the terms and provisions of the conveyance, and as one of its considerations, the Coconut Company assumed and agreed to pay the whole amount of the debt evidenced by the two mortgages. After such conveyance was made to it, the Coconut Company executed a third mortgage to the defendant Heyward upon the tract of land now in question, together with other property, to secure the payment of the sum of P36,600. All three mortgages and the debt from the defendant Haskell to the Coconut Company were each duly registered with the registrator of deeds for the Province of Laguna in the chronological order of their execution. The interest upon the two mortgages in favor of the plaintiff was paid up to the two mortgages in favor of the plaintiff was paid up to and including April 30, 1924. Thereafter, no other payments have been made of either principal or interest on either of such mortgages. February 19, 1925, plaintiff filed a complaint in which he prayed for a foreclosure of one of the mortgages, and on July 14, 1925, he filed an amended complaint in which he prayed for a decree for the foreclosure of both of his mortgages, and against the defendants Haskell and the Magdalena Coconut Company for the sum of P20,000, with interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from December 1, 1922, and the further sum of P12,200, with like interest thereon from April 28, 1923, together with the further sum of 10 per cent of the amount found due and owing upon such mortgages as attorney’s fees, and that the mortgages be declared a prior and superior lien upon the property therein described, and that it be sold to satisfy the amount of the debt found due and owing to the plaintiff, and that in case of a deficiency, that the plaintiff have judgment over and against the defendants Haskell and the Magdalena Coconut Company for the amount of such deficiency, together with costs. By way of answer to the amended complaint, the Coconut Company and Heyward made a general denial of all of the material allegations of the complaint, but later the Coconut Company filed an amended answer in which it admitted that it had assumed and agreed to pay the amount of the two mortgages executed by the defendant Haskell to and in favor of the plaintiff, and as a cross-complaint it alleged that the mortgage contracts were usurious, and for such reason ought not to be enforced. For answer the defendant Haskell made a general and specific denial, and as a special defense, alleged that after the execution of the mortgages by him to the plaintiff, he the said Haskell, with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, sold the property therein described to the defendant Coconut Company, which undertook and agreed to pay the amount of the mortgage indebtedness, and that it was stipulated and agreed between Haskell and the plaintiff that, he Haskell, was then arising from or growing out of the mortgages. That the plaintiff has breached the contracts, and that the defendant Haskell has suffered damages in the amount of P10,000. As a cross-complaint, he also alleges that the original mortgage contracts were usurious. To each of such answers, the plaintiff filed a reply under oath. Upon such issues, the lower court released the defendant Haskell from all liability under the mortgages, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant the Magdalena Coconut Company for the amount of plaintiff’s claim, with interest at 12 per cent per annum from May 1, 1924, and the further sum of P1,000 as attorney’s fees, and gave the company six months within which to pay the amount of the judgment, and ordering that in the event it was not paid within that time, that the property should then be sold at public auction to satisfy the judgment. To the rendition of that judgment, plaintiff duly excepted, and on appeal, contends that the lower court erred: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. When it found the defendant had consented in writing to the assumption by the Magdalena Coconut Co., Inc., one of the defendants, of the mortgage obligations and that such assumption constituted a substitution of debtors, thus relieving the defendant Haskell of his obligations under such mortgages. \"2. When it reduced the attorney’s fees stipulated in the contracts sued upon from 10 per cent of the amount found due thereon to the sum of P1,000. \"3. When it absolved the defendant A. D. Haskell from the complaint. \"4. When it failed to find and declare that the two mortgages of the plaintiff sued upon herein are superior to and have preference over the mortgage executed by the defendant, the Magdalena Coconut Co., Inc., in favor of the other defendant A. S. Heyward. \"5. In granting the defendants a longer period than three months within which to pay the judgment rendered against them. \"6.

      "STATEMENT July 23, 1924, the defendant, a licensed corporation, duly authorized to do business in the Philippine Islands, issued its insurance policy No. 585625 on the life of Jose Concepcion Juares in an by which it promised and agreed to pay P5,000 to the legal representatives of the insured, if, and upon the condition that, the policy was in legal force and effect at the time of the death of the insured. Jose Concepcion Juares died in January, 1925. The plaintiff, Susana Glaraga, was duly appointed as administratrix of his estate, and a demand was made upon the company for the amount of the policy and payment refused. Plaintiff alleges that the defendant O. O. Hanson was the agent of the insurance company, who insured the life of Jose Concepcion Juares, and was the identical person to whom the first premium on the policy was paid on June 3, 1924, and that Hanson was one of the agents authorized by the company to collect premiums; that the second premium should have been paid in December, 1924, and that the deceased was prepared to send the amount of it to the defendant at Manila, and that he would have sent it in due time, but that before remitting the money, he received from the defendant Hanson written instructions not to send the amount of the premium to Manila, and stating that he, Hanson, would pay it to the insurance company; that when Hanson came to Negros in the months of January, 1925, he would collect the premium to reimburse himself, and plaintiff avers that Hanson did pay the second premium to the company at its maturity; that after the death of Juares, and before this action was brought, plaintiff made a demand upon the company for the payment of the policy, which was refused. Wherefore, she prays for judgment against the insurance company for P5,000, with legal interest and costs, and that should it develop that Hanson has on paid the insurance company the second premium, which the undertook to pay, the judgment be rendered against him joint severally with the company for the full amount of the policy, with legal interest. As a special defense, the insurance company alleges that by the terms of the policy in question, a premium was payable at the rate of P169.30 for each semester, and was to be paid on the 1st of June and December of each year, or within a period of grace of not more than thirty days following such dates; that the insured paid the first premium on June 1, 1924, but that he failed and neglected to pay the premium which was due on December 1, 1924, or within thirty days thereafter, or at any other time, and that no payment of such premium was ever made by any one; that by the express terms of policy, the failure of the insured to make the second payment at maturity or within thirty days thereafter caused the policy to lapse and to be thereafter without any force of effect; that by reason of the failure to make such payment, the policy had elapsed and was of no legal force or effect at the time of the death of the deceased. For a second special defense, is alleges that the policy expressly provides: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"No persons, except the President, Managing-Director or Secretary has power to alter this contract, to extend the time for paying a premium, to bind the Company by making any promise or by receiving any representation or information not contained in the application for this policy. No payment made to any person, except in exchange for the Company’s official receipt, will be recognized by the Company. This policy does not take effect until the first premium has been actually paid, during the life and good health of the insured.\" cralaw virtua1aw library That this defendant at no time authorized or empowered its defendant O. O. Hanson or any other person, to modify the terms of the policy, and that Hanson is not an official of the defendant corporation. For a third special defense, the company alleges that it did not have any knowledge of the alleged promise of its codefendant Hanson to pay the second premium upon the policy, and it never received from him any payment whatever on behalf of the insured within the thirty-day period of grace or ever at all, and it prays that the action be dismissed, and that this defendant go hence without day, with costs. For answer the defendant Hanson admits the allegations made in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of plaintiff’s amended complaint, the issuance of the policy in question, and the payment of the first premium, and specifically denies all other allegations of the complaint, or that Jose Concepcion Juares ever paid him any premium on the policy during the month of January, 1925, or at any other time, and prays that the action against him be dismissed. After the evidence was taken upon such issues, the lower court rendered Judgment against both defendants for the full amount of the policy, with interest from April 8, 1925 less P169.30, the amount of the second premium. On its appeal, the defendant insurance company contends that: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The trial court erred in holding that the failure of the insured to pay the premium on the policy here in question within the time prescribed by the contract did not cause the insurance policy to lapse. \"The trial court erred in holding that an agreement on the part of the solicitor to assume the obligation of the insured to pay his premium is binding upon the insurance company. \"The court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant insurance company and in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The defendant Hanson contends that: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I.

For answer the defendant makes a specific denial of paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 5, and admits that the plaintiff, as a corporation, presented its claim against the defendant, and that payment was refused, and admits that plaintiff requested the defendant to specify the reason for its refusal, and that plaintiff has made a demand for arbitration, and that defendant denied any liability and refused arbitration, and that a special defense alleges that the policy in question was issued \"to one Peter Johnson, as proprietor of Paris-Perfumery Co.,\" and that the company was not the insured named in the policy, and that the insurance was of no legal force and effect with the company. As a second special defense, it is alleged that \"the policy of insurance did not cover any loss or damage occasioned by explosion,\" and that the loss was occasioned by an explosion, and was not covered by the policy. As a third special defense, it is alleged that the policy provides that, if the claim is fraudulent, and that any false declaration was made or used to obtain, it all benefits are thereby forfeited; that the claim of the plaintiff is fraudulent as to the quantity and value of the insured property at the time of the fire. As a fourth special defense, it is alleged that the policy becomes forfeited if a loss is occasioned by the willful act or connivance of the insured, and that the loss in question was caused by the willful act of Peter Johnson, and it prays that plaintiff’s complaint be dismissed, with costs. Upon such issues, the evidence was taken, and the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for P13,000, with legal interest from November 7, 1924, the date of the filing of the complaint, and costs. On appeal the defendant assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I.

For answer the defendant Gisbert admits the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the amended complaint, and specifically denies all other allegations, and as a special defense alleges that any interest which he had as charterer of the steamship was transferred to his codefendant Ricardo Caballero, as evidenced by a public document executed July 22, 1924, a copy of which is attached to, and made a part of, the pleadings; that in and thereby the defendant Caballero assumed all the rights and obligations of this defendant, of which the plaintiff had knowledge, and as a counterclaim, he alleges that he acted merely as a captain of the chartered steamer for three months, and that his services were reasonably worth the sum of P500 a month. Wherefore, he prays that, as to him, the complaint be dismissed, and that he have judgment against the plaintiff and the defendant Caballero for P1,500, with interest and costs. For answer the defendant Caballero makes a specific denial, and as a first special defense alleges that, notwithstanding the provisions in article 18 of the charter-party, there was an agreement that such provisions could not and would not be enforced; that about August 6, 1924, the plaintiff advised the defendant Gisbert to immediately deposit $40,000 in lieu of a membership by which the plaintiff might be secured, and in accord with the regulations of the American Steamship Owners’ Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association; that as a result thereof, this defendant was relieved from all liability as the supposed surety of Gisbert. As a second special defense, it is alleged that the supposed delay in the payment of the freight by the defendant Gisbert was due not only to the requirement made by the United States Shipping Board in connection with the additional security in cash in the sum of $40,000, but also to a prior agreement had between plaintiff and the defendant Gisbert, pending the arrangement with regard to the controversies between them on account of the $40,000 in the nature of a bond. As a third special defense, it is alleged that the expenses in connection with the repairs of the ship in the sum of P8,978.33 is not a legal claim and ought not to be charged against either Gisbert or this defendant. As a cross-complaint, the defendant alleges that about July 28, 1924, he deposited with the plaintiff the sum of P20,000, which was then and is now his property, which was the subject of a letter dated September 3, 1924, in which he demanded the return of the money, which was refused, and he prays for judgment absolving him from all liability as surety, and that he is entitled to the possession and return of the P20,000. In October, 1925, Ruiz, Rementeria & Co., Ltd., filed a bill of intervention in which it is alleged that in June, 1924, the defendant, now the plaintiff, was the owner of the ship in question, and that the defendant Gisbert was the captain, and that this plaintiff was the owner of a grocery store in the City of Manila; that on June 27, 1924, the defendant Gisbert, as captain and master of the vessel, bought on credit from the intervenor provisions for the vessel of the value of P316.10, the amount of which has never been paid, and it prays for corresponding judgment, with costs. After the evidence was taken upon such issues, the lower court rendered judgment against the defendant Juan Gisbert, as principal, and the defendant Ricardo Caballero, as surety, and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P7,232.50, with legal interest from October 29, 1924, and against the defendant Gisbert, and in favor of Ruiz, Rementeria & Co. for the sum of P316.10, and that the plaintiff should return to the defendant Caballero the P20,000 in question, after deducting therefrom the P7,232.50 and interest. From that judgment, all parties appeal, and in it’s appeal the plaintiff assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"The trial court erred: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. In rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff-appellant for charter hire and insurance premiums upon the vessel Lake Farmingdale, in the sum of P7,232 50 covering one month only, instead of P22,339.94, P19,264 93 or charter hire and P3,075.01 for insurance premiums for three months and two days covering the period July 16 1924, to October 27, 1924, the date of the sale of the vessel, three months and eleven days, less nine days allowance for the period the vessel was undergoing repair. 2.

The lower court erred in not finding that the real charter of the steamship Lake Farmingdale was the defendant Ricardo Caballero.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The defendant Caballero assigns the following errors: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"1. The lower court erred in admitting over the objection of appellant Ricardo Caballero Exhibit B of the United States of America. \"2. The lower court erred in admitting over the objection of Ricardo Caballero the testimony of Juan Gisbert in relation to the existence of a bond or undertaking which had deference to Ricardo Caballero. \"3. The lower court erred in finding that the undertaking for the sum of $10,000 subscribed by the Philippine Guaranty Company on June 26, 1924, to guarantee the faithful performance by Juan Gisbert of his obligations under the terms of the charter party was substituted by the cash deposit made by Ricardo Caballero. \"4. The lower court erred in finding that Ricardo Caballero assumed the obligations of a surety to the full extent of his cash deposit from the moment the said Ricardo Caballero made said cash deposit of P20,000, and in holding him liable as surety for Juan Gisbert. \"5. The lower court erred in not finding Ricardo Caballero entitled to the full amount of P20,000 instead of adjudicating the said sum of P20,000 less the amount awarded to the plaintiff entity. \"6. The lower court erred in sentencing Ricardo Caballero, as surety, to pay the sum of P7,232.50 with legal interest thereon from October 29, 1924, to the United States of America. \"7. The lower court erred in not finding that there had been a novation of the contract of charter party between the United States of America and Juan Gisbert sufficient under the law to release Ricardo Caballero as alleged bondsman even granting but not conceding that he had assumed responsibility as surety for the charterer. \"8. The lower court erred in not finding that the alleged delay on the part of Juan Gisbert in the payment of the monthly rental was due to a previous arrangement between the owner of the vessel and the charterer thereof, in consequence of which Caballero was relieved from responsibility under a contract of suretyship which we shall assume to have existed. \"9. The lower court erred in not finding that at the time of the alleged violation of the terms of the charter-party by Juan Gisbert, Ricardo Caballero had not yet made the cash deposit of P20,000 and consequently should not be held answerable for Gisbert’s default even were we to grant for the sake of argument that Caballero actually assumed the obligations of a surety.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The intervenor-appellant contends that the lower court erred in not sentencing the plaintiff as owner of the vessel Lake Farmingdale and the defendant Juan Gisbert to pay jointly and severally the sum of P316.10, the value of the merchandise furnished the vessel.

S. Crossfield, then Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in charge of probate and guardianship matters, with the full knowledge and approval of all the parties in interest, approved the same by placing on each said documents, under the seal of the court, the following endorsement: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Aprobado: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"A. S. CROSSFIELD \"Juez\" That under the provisions of paragraph II of the lease, the lessees undertook to construct the bidding on the land in question at cost to them of not less than P52,000; that under the provisions of paragraph IX, it was agreed that upon the expiration of the lease, the buildings and other improvements placed thereon by the lessees should become the sole property of the owners of the land; that relying thereon, the lessees erected the building on the leased land, in compliance with the terms of the lease; that in the accounts of the guardianship for the years of 1913 to 1919, inclusive, which were approved by the respective orders of the court, the receipt of the stipulated rentals in the contract of lease, Exhibit B is shown and the approval of said accounts \"necessarily involved an approval of the lease under which the payment of said rentals was made;\" that through some error or oversight, no order of this court approving said lease, Exhibits B and C, was ever entered of record in the above entitled cause;\" that taking advantage of that fact, Faustino Lichauco, a subsequently appointed guardian of the above-named prodigal brought an action to set aside the lease as being voidable, for the reason that the lease was never judicially approved; that in the Court of First Instance of Manila that action dismissed, and upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the lease, was there declared to be voidable \"by reason of the fact that no order of approval of the execution of said lease by Geronimo Jose, at that time guardian of the said prodigal, was made of record.\" It is then alleged: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"That the letter of July 7, 1913, to which reference is made in the preceding citation from the said decision of the Supreme Court is the same letter of which a copy is hereunto annexed, marked Exhibit A, and made a part hereof, and the contract mentioned in the said decision is the contract executed on behalf of Zacarias Lichauco by his then guardian, Geronimo Jose, evidenced by the copies of said contract hereunto attached, marked Exhibits B and C, and made a part hereof. \"That the Supreme Court in said decision expressly held that all that was necessary to make the said contract of lease valid as regards the estate of the said prodigal Zacarias Lichauco, was the approval of this honorable court. \"That inasmuch as the said prodigal, Zacarias Lichauco; as the Supreme Court has expressly decided in the abovementioned case, was under a valid and binding obligation at the time he was subjected to guardianship, to enter into the contract subsequently entered into on his behalf by his guardian, Geronimo Jose, its disaffirmance by the subsequent guardian, Faustino Lichauco, amounts to a breach of a valid and subsisting contract, which, if permitted to continue, will subject the estate of the said prodigal, Zacarias Lichauco, to the payment of heavy damages. \"That the said contract of lease, Exhibits B and C, made by the said Geronimo Jose in execution of the preliminary contract entered into by the said Zacarias Lichauco while competent to contract and obligate himself, is valid and binding, save only for the lacking requisite of the approval of this honorable court. \"Therefore, your petitioners pray that the pending motion of the former guardian, Geronimo Jose, of date October 15, 1913, for the approval of said lease, Exhibits B and C be granted, and that the said lease be approved by this honorable court.\" cralaw virtua1aw library To this petition, Amparo Nable Jose, as guardian of the prodigal, Zacarias Lichauco, answered and asked the court to deny and dismiss the petition, for the reason that on October 15, 1913, the motion of Geronimo Jose was practically withdrawn and repudiated by Geronimo Lichauco, then guardian ad litem of the prodigal, Zacarias Lichauco, and that on September 17, 9120, the said Faustino Lichauco filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila in which, among other things, he asked for an annulment of the contract, and upon which judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands for the plaintiff and against the defendants, the herein petitioners, and in which case, the defendants’ application for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States; for all of the questions raised by the petitioners have already been adversely decided by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, and that all of such questions are now res judicata. Upon such issues, the lower court granted the motion as prayed for in the petition, and rendered a judgment purporting to affirm and ratify the original lease, which this court declared void for want of execution.

      "ROMUALDEZ; J. : chanrob1es virtual 1aw library The appellants were charged with taking Cristina Biel away through force, violence and intimidation against her will and with lewd design p, prosecuted, tried, and convicted by the Court of First Instance of Manila found guilty of the crime of abduction with violence and each sentenced to fourteen years, eight months and one day reclusion temporal, the accessory penalties, and one-third of the costs. The three accused appeal from said judgment, each denying, in the memorandum presented by respective counsel, being guilty of the crime charged. Cristina Biel, the offended party, asserts that in company with her two children of tender age, she was taken to Manila from Cavite by Ramon Cosca in an automobile, by force and with evident lewd designs; that in the car, driven by one of the three defendants there were besides the latter and the offended party and her two children, two women, one named Ema and the other Catalina Daño; that upon arriving at Manila they went to Quiapo Church, where Ema alighted, and from there they went to a canteen belonging to David Thomas in the barrio of Sangandaan, Rizal, where all alighted, the accused taking beer and Cosca wine, offering her some beer which she declined; that from said canteen they returned to Manila, stopping in front of a store on Rizal Avenue, and there Ramon Cosca frightened her with a pistol (which turned out to be a toy), and Vicente Salas with some bullets which he bought at said store, the defendant Santiago Mapalad warning her that if she did not accede to his wishes, everybody would die in the automobile; that she, both there and at other points along the way, started to shout but Ramon Cosca put his hand over her mouth; that from Rizal Avenue, they went and stopped in front of the Savoy Theater, the defendant Mapalad alighting to fetch Ema; that there, because the people were beginning to stare at the automobile on account of the shouts of the offended party, Ramon Cosca let her and her children go; that she went to an office in which there was a Spaniard or an American and asked him to defend her; that Ramon Cosca went up to her offering P50 if she would go back to Cavite, but she refused; that, in running about in her excitement she met a policeman, Dionisio Comendador, to whom she related the occurrence; that on the advice of said policeman, she and her two children went to the Meisic station. There is no question in the case that the trip was made along that route and by all the persons mentioned by the offended party. What the defense contends is that the offended party, not only went with the defendants willingly, but that it is she who suggested to Ramon Cosca that they all take the ride to Manila on the afternoon in question. At the outset, it seems rather strange that the defendants in thus abducting the offended party, allowed two other women to accompany them who were not shown to have any connection therewith, and headed for Manila, of all places, and went to the crowded sections of the City. The offended party’s testimony touching the force and violence and other attempts to which she was subjected, is not sufficiently corroborated in the record. While it is true that the witness Catalina Daño, in her declaration before the Constabulary (Exhibit C) in substance confirmed the offended party in her incriminating statements against the accused, yet, during the trial of the case upon being asked to explain her declaration to the Constabulary written in Exhibit C, declared that such statement given by her was untrue, taught to her by the offended party because the latter said her husband would kill her. David Thomas and Casimira Thomas, the owners of the canteen named \"Country Home,\" state that except for the fact that Cristina Biel seemed vexed or disgusted while in the canteen, and said: \"What sort of men are these to make my husband appear as a cuckold!\", — aside from this they say they noticed nothing out of the ordinary about her, nor did she ask for any help. Neither of these witnesses corroborates the offended party in her declaration that while there she asked for an auto for rent in which to return to Cavite. If it were true as she says that she was then the victim of the accused, she could have asked for help at that canteen, and remained there in order to separate herself from the defendants instead of again going with them of her own free Will, according to the testimony of said owners of that establishment. Policeman Comendador, indeed, testified that the offended party approached him and told him that she had been brought to Manila against her will by some men who ran away. But in view of the result of the proceeding, the story which she told the policeman must have been an accusation devised by her against the defendants on account of not having been able to obtain from Ramon Cosca the P50 which she had repeatedly asked him for during the trip and which Cosca did not give her promising it to her when they got to Cavite; which, as shown by the evidence of the defense, seems worthier of credence being more probable and partially corroborated by the witnesses for the prosecution. For, Ramon Cosca testifies that at the time of the incident, he was having intimate relations with the offended party; although the latter denies it, she admits that for some time she has been separated from Constantino Teodosis, the man with whom she lived maritally and had children, and that she went to live in the house of Ema, one of her companions on the trip on the afternoon in question, and that the defendant Ramon Cosca used to visit her in that house. Cosca testified that on the morning of the incident, the offended party asked him to take her for a ride to Manila, and that is why he told the old woman Catalina Daño to look for an automobile in the afternoon and pick up the offended party, passing later for him and Ema, who wished to go with them to Manila, all of which took place as stated. He is substantially corroborated in this not only by his codefendant Santiago Mapalad, but even by the witness for the prosecution Catalina Daño, especially as to the fact that it was the offended party who at that time wanted to come to Manila. Ramon Cosca also states that upon reaching the Savoy Theater, he and his codefendants left the car to look for Ema; that on returning to it Cristina Biel and her two children were no longer there; that he and his companions got into the car again and drove around the place in search of the offended party and her children returning to the said Savoy Theater, where they were seen and arrested by a policeman. The fact that they returned to that place is corroborated by Policeman Comendador who is the one, upon having learned from Cristina Biel the number of the car, recognized it, stopped it and after having consulted his sergeant by telephone detained the three appellants and the old woman Dano. The fact in itself, thus confirmed, of having driven around from about 6 o’clock, when the offended party went up to Policeman Comendador, until about 8 o’clock, when the same policeman detained the defendants, according to the time fixed by him, tends to confirm the allegation of the defense that the defendants were really looking for the offended party. If it were true that, as she declared, being pursued by Ramon Cosca she entered the office of a Spaniard or American (who, to be sure, did not testify in this case) asking for help and that Ramon Cosca in order to silence her offered her P50 which she rejected, it would seem highly improbable that in the face of such conduct on the part of the offended party, the defendants should have still remained at the place, driving around there, instead of fleeing from Manila in order to cover up their guilt. Considering all the circumstances of the case, we deem the defense’s allegation worthy of credit, to the effect that during the trip in question she asked Ramon Cosca for P50 which the latter did not give her but promised to do so in Cavite, whereat she became displeased and made up her mind to go to the police and denounce the accused. In cases like the present one wherein the offended party’s story, the greater part of which is improbable, is not corroborated by the other evidence of the case as against the defendants, and wherein the allegations of the defense appear to be more in consonance with the normal and usual course of human events, and are partly confirmed by the evidence in the case, and even by the testimony of some of the witnesses for the prosecution, the best action to take, as justice demands, is to give more credit to the exculpatory testimony of the defendants applying in their favor, as subsisting and intact the presumption that a man is innocent until the contrary is shown. For the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the appellants are acquitted with the costs de oficio and other pronouncements in their favor, and it is ordered that Santiago Mapalad, one of said appellants, at present detained in this case, be immediately released. So ordered. Avanceña, C.J. , Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand and Villa-Real, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "OSTRAND,J p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library The accused was charged with the crime of murder in the court of First Instance of Leyte, the information reading as follows: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Que en o hacia el 23 de febrero de 1931, en el Municipio de Cabalian, Provincia de Leyte, Islas Filipinas, y dentro de la jurisdiccion de este Juzgado, el referido accusado, con un bolo de que estaba provisto, voluntaria, ilegal y criminalmente, y con premeditacion conocida, agredio alevosamente al Dr. Jose Hipe en las espalda fuera de la columna vertebral al lado izquierdo, que le causo la muerte despues de dieciocho dias.\" cralaw virtua1aw library After due trial the court below found the defendant guilty of the crime charged, with the mitigating circumstance of obfuscation, and sentenced him to seventeen years and one day of cadena temporal with the accessory penalties, to indemnify the family of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, and to pay the costs. Thereupon the defendant appealed to this court. The evidence establishes that on February 22, 1931, the defendant, Victorio Gules, asked Dr. Jose Hipe to cure him and three children. In reply to the request, Dr. Hipe went to the defendant’s residence and began treating him and his children. On the afternoon of that day one of the children died, and the defendant lost faith in Dr. Hipe. The defendant thereupon had himself and his children treated by a quack doctor. Hipe resented this, although he was prevailed upon by the defendant’s wife to come and continue treating her children. On the afternoon of the next day, Dr. Hipe went to the defendant’s residence to continue his treatment, but the defendant told him not to give the same medicine as that he had already given to the child who had died. This annoyed Dr. Hipe, and he refused to continue curing the defendant’s children, and at the same time he demanded the payment of the medicines that he had administered to them. The defendant remonstrated, saying that he had no money at that time. He thereupon went to the kitchen to get drinking water for the sick children, and he there saw a bolo, which he took, and then returned to Dr. Hipe, insisting that the latter should treat the children. The doctor persisted in his refusal, and as he was going down stairs, the defendant stabbed him in the back with the bolo and thereby inflicted the wound which caused Dr. Hipe’s death nineteen days later. The facts as stated above are established not only by the testimony of Narcisa Saludo and Eliseo Saludo, widow and father-in-law respectively of the deceased, but also by the testimony of the defendant himself. He admitted that he had wounded Dr. Hipe, but alleged that he could not tell how he did it, because he was then obfuscated. There can be no question of the defendant’s guilt. The crime committed is murder, which is punished under the new Penal Code with reclusion temporal. As indicated above, there is one mitigating circumstance, namely obfuscation, in favor of the defendant, and without any aggravating circumstance against him. The court below sentenced the defendant to seventeen years and one day of cadena temporal. As that penalty is not entirely correct, it must be modified by imposing upon the accused a penalty of seventeen years, four months, and one day of reclusion temporal. In all other respects the judgment of the court below is correct. With costs against the appellant. So ordered. Avanceña, C.J. , Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez and Imperial, JJ. , concur. Villa-Real, J. , concurs in the result.\n",

      "VICKERS, J. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library The appellant Marcelo Honrada was tried in the Court of First Instance of Cavite for the crime of frustrated murder. It was alleged in the information: \"That on or about July 1st, 1934, in the municipality of General Trias, Province of Cavite, Philippine Islands, the said accused with intent to kill one Gregorio Estandarte did, then and there voluntarily, illegally and criminally and with treachery stab him with a big knife inflicting on him a wound, stabbed perforating, hypochondrium, right, cutting costal arch; would stabbed, penetrating, liver, right; wound, incised, chest, left, upper 1 1/2 inches; wound, incised, lumbar, right (3 1/2 inches, 1/3 inch deep); wound, stabbed penetrating to bone, lumbar, left (cutting muscles, 1 1/2 inches wide, 1 1/2 inches deep); wound, incised, nose ridge (1 centimeter) having the accused performed all the acts which would produce the death of the said Gregorio Estandarte as a consequence, but which, nevertheless did not produce it by reason or causes independent of the will of the accused, and which wounds incapacitated the said Gregorio Estandarte for his customary labor and required medical attendance for a period of more than 60 days.\" cralaw virtua1aw library The trial judge found the defendant guilty as charged, and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty ranging from four years, two months, and one day of prision correccional to eight years and one day of prision mayor, and to pay the costs. From that judgment the defendant has appealed to this court, and now alleges that the lower court erred in not finding that the defendant acted in legitimate self-defense; in finding that the offense committed was frustrated murder, and that it was committed with alevosia. It appears from the evidence that while Gregorio Estandarte was walking along the road in the municipality of General Trias about four o’clock in the afternoon of July 1, 1934 he was suddenly and without warning stabbed twice in the back, and when he looked around he saw the defendant with a long fan knife in his hand. The defendant then renewed the attack, and Estandarte tried to defend himself with the riding whip he was carrying, but the defendant succeeded in stabbing him in the abdomen. The offended party fell on his back in a ditch beside the road. The defendant continued the attack and stabbed the offended party in the chest and under the breastbone. The assault took place near the house of Candido Rosari; and Maxima Ballecer, who was going to the house of Rosari and saw the defendant attack the offended party, shouted for help. Miguel Tagle, Pedro Ballecer, and Leonardo Figueroa heard her cries and went to the scene of the crime. When the defendant saw the three men approaching he ran away. Pedro Ballecer took the wounded man to the poblacion, where he was given first aid. He was then taken to the Philippine General Hospital. Upon examination by Dr. E. M. Lesaca he was found to have the following wounds: A stabbed wound under the breastbone, a stabbed wound penetrating the liver, an incised wound in the right lumbar region and another in the left lumbar region, and an incised wound on the nose. He was also suffering from shock and anemia. Because of the wound in the liver, he was promptly operated upon, and was able to leave the hospital at the end of three weeks. It does not clearly appear what was the motive for the murderous assault. It may have been the fact that about a week prior to the occasion in question Gregorio Estandarte, in trying to separate two men who were fighting, struck Hilario Honrada, defendant’s father, with his elbow. Hilario Honrada resented the action of Estandarte and tried to hit him, but Estandarte ran away. Hilario Honrada told Estandarte that his time would come. The theory of the defense is that the defendant was attacked by Gregorio Estandarte with a blackjack; that the defendant ran away after he received two blows, and was pursued by the offended party and his companions, Leonardo Figueroa, Miguel Tagle, and Santiago Loren. According to the accused Figueroa and Loren struck him with sticks. The defendant testified that the offended party overtook him and struck him several times with a blackjack, whereupon the defendant stabbed the offended party in self-defense; that a struggle ensued between them and they fell into a ditch, and the offended party was wounded in the back when they fell down. It appears that the so-called caborrata was not a blackjack, but only a riding whip. The trial judge rejected the contention of the defense, and we think he was fully justified in doing so. The testimony of the defendant that the offended party received the two wounds in the back when he fell into the ditch is incredible. They were undoubtedly caused by the defendant when he attacked the offended party from behind, as stated by the latter and Maxima Ballecer. The attack was therefore treacherous, and the number and seriousness of the wounds, especially the one in the abdomen that penetrated the liver, show that it was the intention of the defendant to kill the offended party. It was only the prompt and skillful medical treatment which the offended party received that saved his life. The offense committed by the defendant was therefore frustrated murder. He is entitled to the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender. The penalty imposed by the lower court is not in accordance with the law. Murder is punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, and in accordance with article 50 the penalty for frustrated murder is one degree lower, or prision mayor in its maximum period to reclusion temporal in its medium period. The minimum period of this penalty is from ten years and one day to twelve years of prision mayor. It is true that article 250 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the courts, in view of the facts of the case, may impose upon the person guilty of the frustrated crime of parricide, murder or homicide a penalty lower by one degree than that which should be imposed under the provisions of article 50, but there exists in this case no special reason for applying article 250. In accordance with the Indeterminate Sentence Law the minimum penalty to be served by the defendant was correctly fixed at four years, two months, and one day. The appellant is therefore sentenced to suffer an indeterminate sentence ranging from four years, two months, and one day of prision correccional to ten years and one day of prision mayor. As thus modified, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the Appellant . Avanceña, C.J. , Abad Santos, Hull, and Recto, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "RECTO, J. p. Charges having been filed in the Court of First Instance of Davao against Oso (Mandaya) for the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape, judgment has been rendered sentencing the accused to an indeterminate penalty of from twelve years of prision mayor, as minimum, to twenty years of reclusion temporal, as maximum, with the accessory penalties and the costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed. The facts of the case, as disclosed by the evidence, are: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library At twilight on November 25, 1932, while Sovida, a Mandaya, married to Masumbid, of the same tribe, was drawing water from a well in an uninhabited place at a certain distance from her house in Cabaihan, within the municipality of Manay, Province of Davao, she was seized by Oso, another Mandaya. Attracted by her cries her brother Dumaguiong, who happened to be in her house, came to her rescue; but Oso, upon seeing him, leveled his lance and, threatening to kill him, warned him not to approach, whereupon Dumaguiong desisted from his purpose to free Sovida whom Oso later forcibly took, thru woodlands, to his house in Bohañginan within the same municipality, arriving there at about midnight. Oso whose caveman instincts did not appear to have been subdued or moderated by instruction, having received none, and who lacks the most elementary notions and scruples of morality and decency ordinarily found among individuals belonging even to communities less impervious to the cares and influence of civilization, ordered his wife and children to leave the house, that the might spend the night with Sovida and cohabit with her, which he did against her will. In the meantime, Dumaguiong went in search of Masumbid, who was then away, to inform him of what had happened to Sovida. They thought of pursuing Oso to free Sovida, but partly because their courage failed them and partly because it was already dark, they decided to wait for the next day when they set forth for Oso’s house. Oso saw them approaching, and stationing himself at the stairs, lance in hand, warned Sovida’s husband and her brother to desist from taking her away from him because they would lose their lives in such an attempt. Scared, Masumbid and Dumaguiong resolved to leave to the authorities the task of freeing Sovida which seemed to surpass the strength of their arms and their valor. They therefore left the place and went to the house of Malinas, the barrio lieutenant, who, likewise intimidated by Oso, refused to intervene in the case, sending the complainants to councilor Tomambing. The latter, \"considering the case serious\", took the same attitude and advised them to see the municipal president who immediately ordered a policeman to bring forth Oso and Sovida. Oso attempted to resist the policeman but finally surrendered. Sovida returned to her home. She had been in Oso’s power for seven days during which her abductor, through intimidation, cohabited with her several times. The corresponding information was filed in the justice of the peace court of Manay of December 8, 1932, upon Sovida’s affidavit corroborated by that of Dumaguiong. A few days after Oso’s arrest he escaped from jail and was not apprehended until October 16th of the following year. On the 18th of said month Sovida filed a new complaint (Exhibit D) whereupon legal proceedings followed resulting in Oso’s conviction and sentence in the Court of First Instance. The court is of the opinion that the errors assigned by the appellant’s counsel de oficio as regards the manner the trial judge weighed the evidence and appreciated the facts, do not exist in the appealed decision. Against the testimony of Sovida, Dumaguiong, Masumbid, barrio lieutenant Malinas and councilor Tomambing, the essential points of which are corroborated, we only have that of Oso and his brother Buagnot. The theory of the defense, based on the testimony of Oso and Buagnot, which deserves no credit from this court, is that Sovida, maltreated by her husband, took refuge in the house of the accused insisting on becoming Oso’s wife and that during her stay in Oso’s house, the latter never cohabited with her. Oso’s wife would have been a competent witness to corroborate Oso’s testimony and to refute Sovida’s but she was not called upon to testify and this omission is in no way explained. No disinterested witness appeared or was presented to establish the facts on which the appellant bases the theory of his defense, and, inasmuch as the conclusions of the lower court relative to the facts involved in the suit are correct and no law or rule of evidence was infringed nor any essential right of the accused disregard thereby, this court is bound to sustain them as a basis in determining the nature of the crime to be penalized in this case. There is no doubt that the facts considered as proven by the lower court and this court constitute the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape. It appears, however, that Sovida’s complaint upon which this case was formally instituted in the justice of the peace court of Manay, alleges facts which, while sufficient to constitute the crime of forcible abduction, are not sufficient to determine the crime of rape. In fact, the mere allegation that the accused cohabited with the complainant, without her consent, does not concretely describe the crime of rape in any of its forms which, according to article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, are: the use of force or intimidation; that the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or that the victim is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances above-mentioned is present. Every accused has the right to be duly informed of the nature of the accusation and this legal requisite has not been complied with in this case. It is true that in the information later filed by the fiscal, when the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance for trial on the merits, an attempt was made to correct this defect by supplying the omission of the allegations of the original complaint, but it is also true that the allegation omitted is jurisdictional in character, the crime involved being one which cannot be prosecuted de oficio, and the omission thereof, is fatal and cannot be corrected in the latter stages of the proceeding (article 344, Revised Penal Code, which has substituted section 1 of Act No. 1773; U. S. v. Gomez and Coronel, 12 Phil., 279; U. S. v. Ortiz and Regalado, 19 Phil., 174; U. S. v. Narvas, 14 Phil., 410; U. S. v. Asuncion, 22 Phil., 358). The appellant should not therefore be convicted of the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape, but only of forcible abduction. Not finding any merit in the other assignments of error relied upon by the counsel de oficio in his brief, we hold that the appellant is guilty of the crime of forcible abduction, with the aggravating circumstance of having been committed in an uninhabited place compensated by the lack of instruction of the accused, and sentence him to the penalty of from eight years of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen years, eight months and one day of reclusion temporal as maximum, with the accessory penalties of the law, and the costs.

      "The decision in this case, affirming that of the lower court, was rendered in favor of the appellees on January 16, 1936,1 by a majority of six with four dissenting votes. Under the rules of this court the appellant had fifteen days to apply for a reconsideration of this decision, the last day of said period being the 31st of said month. On the 24th of said month the appellant asked for an extension of said period by seven days, alleging that he would file an alternative petition for reconsideration of the decision rendered therein or for a new trial and that, due to the length of the printed pleadings to be filed by him to this effect, it would be impossible for him to do so within the period fixed by law. This petition was denied. On the 31st of said month, at 4 o’clock p.m., the appellant filed his alternative petition for reconsideration or for a new trial supported by a printed brief consisting of 109 pages and a appendix of 28 pages. On said date, at 7 o’clock in the evening, the court denied said petition for reconsideration with the same division of votes, minus that of one of the dissenting justices who was absent. One of the attorneys for the appellant received notice of said resolution on February 3rd. It does not appear that the other attorneys for the appellant received said notice earlier and it is reasonable to suppose that they received it at the same time, particularly taking into consideration the fact that it could not have been prepared or sent until February 1st on which there was office for only a half day, being Saturday, and could have been received in the ordinary course until Monday, February 3d, as the following day, the second of said month, was Sunday. It is inferred from section 39 of the Rules of this court that after a motion for reconsideration is denied, one may still apply for leave to file a second motion for said purpose. On February 4th, the clerk of court remanded the case to the lower court of execution. On said date, after the case had been remanded to the lower court, the appellant filed his petition for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration or new trial alleging that the court did not have sufficient time to consider the first motion. On February 6th the appellant asked for the recall of the case from the lower court and the retention thereof in this court until his petition for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration or new trial is decided. On March 21st the court granted to the appellant the permission applied for and requested the trial court to return the record to the office of the clerk of this court. After the parties had argued the second motion for reconsideration or new trial, the appellees, on October 6, 1936, presented an affidavit of Zacarias Nuguid, the appellant’s principal witness, retracting his first testimony, in order that it may be taken into consideration by the court in deciding the second motion for reconsideration or new trial. On October 31st the court unanimously ordered the new trial of this case pursuant to sections 496 and 505 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellees excepted to and filed a motion for reconsideration of this last resolution, which is the incident now under consideration by this court. The appellees allege that this court had no jurisdiction to render its resolution of October 31st on the ground that it had already lost it on February 3d. This court finds this contention to be unfounded. When the appellant applied for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration or new trial on February 4th, this court still had jurisdiction over the case and retained it by virtue of said application. If, according to the rule, a party may yet apply for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration after a motion for reconsideration is denied, the court must retain its jurisdiction to grant or deny the motion. In the case at bar this court granted the motion. The rule fixes no time for the filing of said application for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration. Of course a certain period of time must be allowed for the filing thereof because, otherwise, said provision of the rule would be without any purpose. Without referring to other probable cases, it is evident that in the case at bar, as the application was filed on the day following the receipt of notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, which is the first day available for said purpose (sec. 4, Code of Civil Procedure), it was filed in due time. This being so, the material fact that the case was remanded to the trial court a few hours after the filing of the application, without said court’s having taken action by virtue of said remand, and, undoubtedly, before receipt of the record, cannot affect the jurisdiction still had by this court. On the other hand, it cannot be stated that the petition for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration must be presented within the same period of fifteen days for the filing of the first motion for reconsideration, because the rule does not so state and because, if it were so, it would be impossible to file the petition in question where, as in the present case, the first petition, for justifiable reasons, could not be presented until the last day of said period. Furthermore, the question whether or not, after a case is remanded to the trial court for execution of the judgment rendered on appeal, this court may still resume jurisdiction over said case and recall the record, has precedents in the affirmative in our jurisprudence (People v. Santiago, G.R. No. 38677, May 14, 1934 and Nov. 1, 1934 [60 Phil., 1006, 1056]; and Ingson v. Olaybar, 52 Phil., 396). There are likewise precedents to that effect in American jurisprudence, particularly of the Supreme Court of New York, according to the following note 90 (a) in 4 Corpus Juris, 1245, which reads: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"(a)\tNew York rule. — ’It is often erroneously assumed that after the filing of the remittitur in the court below, and order entered thereon, this court is deprived of all jurisdiction in the cause. In Sweet v. Mowry (138 N.Y., 650; 34 N.E., 388), a motion for reargument was granted, and a return of the remittitur requested. These acts of the court were held to be in resumption of jurisdiction. In Lawrence v. Church (128 N.Y., 324; 28 N.E., 499), a motion to amend the remittitur was granted, and the order entered requested the return of the remittitur by the court below, and when so returned it was ordered to be amended. In Moffett v. Elmendorf (153 N.Y., 674; 48 N.E., 1105), a motion to amend remittitur was granted, and order entered that the remittitur be recalled for that purpose. A like motion was granted in Buchanan v. Little (155 N. Y., 635; 49 N.E., 1094). This later practice of the court is not necessarily inconsistent with the earlier cases, which hold that this court has no jurisdiction to grant a reargument or an amendment of the remittitur after the remittitur is filed and acted upon in the court below. (People v. Nelliston, 79 N.Y., 638; Jones v. Anderson, 71 N.Y., 599; Cushman v. Hadfield, 15 Abb. Pr. NS [N.Y. ], 109; Wilmerdings v. Fowler, 15 Abb. Pr. NS. [N.Y. ], 86.) It is competent for this court to determine whether it will resume jurisdiction for any purpose, and, having decided to do so, it then requests the court below to return the remittitur so that the reargument can be had or the remittitur amended, as the case may be. It is technically true that this court must be repossessed of the remittitur before an order made in the cause is effectual, but there is no objection to the return of the remittitur following the determination of this court to resume jurisdiction.’ (Franklin Bank Note Co. v. Mackey, supra.)\" It must furthermore be taken into consideration that when this court, in its order of the 31st of October last, ordered the new trial of the case, it did so for the benefit of not only the appellant but also of the appellees. As already stated, the appellees, on October 6th, presented an affidavit of Zacarias Nuguid, principal witness for the appellant, retracting his former testimony, to be taken into consideration by this court in deciding the second motion for reconsideration or new trial filed by the appellant. The court, however, can not take into consideration said retraction if it is not presented in the case by means of a new trial or, unless it be for the purpose of ordering a new trial. For this reason the court, in decreeing a new trial in its order of October 31st, in the broadest sense provided therein, had in mind to give opportunity not only to the appellant to present his new evidence but also to the appellees to present the retraction of the witness Nuguid. This court is aware of the fact that the new trial will cause delay in the termination of the case but if this is necessary in order to administer justice or to correct a judicial error, the delay would be justified. However, if the parties, after three days from the receipt of notice of this resolution, signify their desire to waive the presentation of said new evidence and to submit the case upon its merits, this court would be willing to do so. In the meantime, the reconsideration sought by the appellees is denied and the order issued on October 31st of this year stands. So ordered. Avanceña, C.J. , Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz and Concepcion, JJ. , concur. Separate Opinions HORRILLENO, J. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library This is a motion submitted by the appellees for the reconsideration of the resolution of this court rendered on October 31st of this year, ordering the case remanded to the trial court for a new trial. The appellees contend that this court no longer had jurisdiction over the case when it rendered its resolution of October 31st. The facts pertinent to the question raised, which appear of record and are not disputed by the parties are as follows: (1) On January 16th of this year, the decision of this court, affirming that of the trial court, was promulgated; (2) after the parties had been notified of the court’s decision, the appellant, on the 31st of said month of January, filed an alternative motion for reconsideration and new trial of the case; (3) on said date, January 31st, this court sitting in banc, denied the appellant’s alternative motion; (4) on February 3d the clerk of this court rendered final judgment; (5) on the 4th of said month the record was remanded to the trial court and a pleading was filed by the appellant asking for leave to present a second motion for reconsideration and a period of 5 days to do so; (6) after this petition had been discussed, this court, in its resolution of March 24th, granted the petition, said appellant presenting his second motion for reconsideration on the 23d of said month of March; (7) on the 28th of said month of March, the appellees were granted a period of ten days to answer the second motion for reconsideration, upon the presentation of which and after the parties had been heard, the court, on October 31st, granting the second motion for reconsideration, ordered the case remanded to the lower court for a new trial; and (8) on November 4th the oppositors-appellees filed a motion praying; (1) that the resolution of this court dated October 31st be reconsidered; (2) that the second motion for reconsideration be denied, and (3) that the record be remanded to the court of origin for the execution of the judgment, which motion is the one now under consideration by this court. As already stated, the attorney for the appellees Faustina Baron Et. Al., contends that this court no longer had jurisdiction over the case when it rendered its said resolution of October 31st. Therefore, the fundamental question to be decided is whether or not this court had jurisdiction over the case when it rendered its resolution of October 31st. It is a principle of sound public interest that a day, a moment, must be fixed when the decisions and resolutions of the courts become final and conclusive for the parties. In no country with a fairly civilized government are the parties to a suit placed in a situation of continuous uncertainty and unending anxiety by the non-establishment of a fixed period after which the judgments of the courts thereof become final and indisputable. Social and economic life would become barrenly stagnant if the rights in litigation, once they are declared and once the last instant it is yet possible and permissible to discuss them has elapsed, did not become definitely established, and the parties to a case would thereby be subjected to Sisyphus’ cruel torment of which the mythologies of old tell us. There must, therefore, be moment when the resolutions and decisions of the courts become final in character once and for all. Our codes and laws, in response to the advance of civilization and a necessity of public interest, prescribe in their provisions the moment when suits in our courts become definitely decided. Now then, when do the decisions of this court become final and conclusive? Sections 37 and 38 of the Rules of the Supreme Court — which are law — provide that.\" . . 15 days after the promulgation of a decision counted from the date of such promulgation, the clerk of the court shall enter judgment and immediately thereafter remand the case to the lower court, unless notice is given, pursuant to Rule 46 of intention to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari , in which event the mittimus shall be stayed pending action by this court upon such notice.\" In this case, as may be noted, the judgment of this court was promulgated on January 16, 1936, and copies thereof were sent to the parties. The appellant filed his first motion for reconsideration only on January 31st of said year, on which date this court, sitting in banc, denied it. On February 3d of the same year, the clerk of court, acting pursuant to sections 37 and 38 of the Rules in question, entered final judgment, and on the following day, that is, on the 4th of said month, he remanded the record to the trial court. In view of these facts, we are of the opinion that this court lost its jurisdiction over the case from February 4, 1936, when the record was remanded to the trial court after final judgment had been entered by the clerk of court on the 3d of said month. (See People v. De la Cruz, G.R. Nos. 42304, 42305, March 19, 1935 [61 Phil., 1030]; Frank and Gohn v. Benito, 51 Phil., 712, and People v. Isleta and Topacio Nueno, 61 Phil., 332.) Therefore, the judgment the consideration of which is sought became final and conclusive on said date, February 4, 1936. It is contended, however, that as a second motion for reconsideration could be presented with the court’s permission, in accordance with section 39 of the Rules, this court still retained its jurisdiction over the case, a petition for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration having been presented on February 4, 1936. It must be taken into consideration that the appellant was notified of the court’s resolution of January 31, 1936, denying the first motion for reconsideration, on the 3d of said month of February which fell on Monday and was an available day because it was not an official holiday. However, said appellant let the whole day, February 3d, on which final judgment was rendered, pass, and did not present his application for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration until the 4th of said month of February, after the clerk of court had already remanded the record of the case to the trial court. Section 39 of the Rules fixes no period for the filing of a second motion for reconsideration, thereby inducing us to believe, and as we are of the opinion, after having studies the Rules, particularly sections 37, 38 and 39 thereof, that motions for reconsideration, be they first or second ones, must be filed within fifteen days from the date of the promulgation of the judgment, because once said period of fifteen days has elapsed with no motion for reconsideration of any kind or notice of intention to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari having been presented, the clerk of the court is, by provision of law and by ministerial duty, bound to enter a definite judgment which, after having been entered and the record remanded to the court of origin, becomes final in character. Furthermore, the very fact that no period is fixed in the Rules for the filing of a second motion for reconsideration is a circumstance strongly in support of our claim. In fact, the Rules have been prepared by this same court whose distinguished members are all jurists with wide professional experience and vast legal knowledge. It must therefore be assumed that they are aware of the questions and conflicts often arising among lawyers in determining the length and limits of the periods already fixed by the laws. This being so, it cannot be assumed that the intention of this court in making its rules was to grant another period outside the fifteen days from the date of the promulgation of the judgment, for the presentation of second motions for reconsideration, because had such been the intention of this court, it would have fixed said period in the rules to avoid multiplicity of questions, many of which are annoying, on the length or limit of the periods fixed by the laws. To think otherwise would be to attribute lack of foresight to the members of this court and deny them their experience and legal knowledge well accredited and recognized by their own countrymen and foreigners, which would be absurd. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the first as well as the second motions for reconsideration must be filed within the period of fifteen days from the date of the promulgation of the decision. We are aware of the doctrines filed in other jurisdictions on the matter, but we maintain that even adopting said doctrines, we should apply them only to cases to which they refer, that is, to those of inadvertence or fraud (See 4 C.J. , 1244, section 3308). In the present case neither inadvertence nor fraud is alleged. Much less does it appear that such irregularities have been committed by any official of this court. The cases of People v. Santiago (G.R. No. 38677, May 14, 1934 and Nov. 1, 1934 [60 Phil., 1006, 1056]), and Ingson v. Olaybar (52 Phil., 395), are not applicable to the case at bar. With respect to the Santiago case, the question of jurisdiction has not been raised therein and, furthermore, it is a criminal case involving, as it is known, the honor and liberty of an individual. The same justices who subscribed the judgment against the accused took part in deciding the motion for reconsideration presented by the defense in said case. With respect to the case of Ingson v. Olaybar, the point disputed therein involved clerical errors, while the present case involves neither the honor nor the liberty of an individual nor the correction of a mere clerical error but, on the contrary, it is sought to reverse a majority opinion of this court when it was yet composed of 11 justices, four of whom, to wit: Justices Malcolm, Hull, Vickers and Butte who subscribed the majority opinion, ceased to be so on February 1st of this year; and Justice Recto, who likewise subscribed the decision, ceased to be a member of this court on November 1, 1936. It is evident, therefore, that there is no similarity between the cases of People v. Santiago, and Ingson v. Olaybar, supra, and the case at bar. We submit, therefore, that this court had already lost its jurisdiction when it took cognizance of the passed upon the second motion for reconsideration. If this second motion for reconsideration has been filed out of time, the blame is on the appellant himself who, having had the opportunity — because the contrary does not having had the opportunity — because the contrary does not appear-to file it within said period of fifteen days, failed to take advantage thereof in presenting it on the last day of said period, that is, on January 31, 1936; and if the appellant neither wished to file his second motion for reconsideration on February 3d when final judgment was rendered and when the record was still in the office of the clerk of this court, nobody but himself is to blame for it. The clerk of this court committed no error or inadvertence in entering final judgment and in remanding the case to the trial court. He not only did not commit any inadvertence or error, but on the contrary, acted in compliance with a ministerial duty prescribed by sections 17 and 18 of the Rules of this court. Let us now discuss the questions from another angle. In other words, granting that this court still had jurisdiction over the case, was its resolution ordering the new trial of the case correct? It appears from the motion for reconsideration of the appellees, and it is not denied by the appellant, that.\" . . the medical certificates subscribed by Drs. Teopaco and Ordoñez, respectively, are dated February 3, 1933, that is, two days after the filing of the petition for the probate of the will in question in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga. Dr. Teopaco is a nephew of Pedro Teopaco, father-in-law of the Honorable and distinguished Justice Jose Abad Santos, brother of Quirino Abad Santos, alleged author of the will and principal witness and attorney for the petitioner Vivencio Cuyugan. Dr. Ordoñez is likewise related to Vivencio Cuyugan. The trial of this case lasted several months and was decided on April 26, 1934. The record was received in the Supreme Court on June 12, 1934, and the appeal was decided on January 16, 1936, . . . .\" Now then, in view of these circumstances, is it reasonable to maintain that the appellant or his attorneys were not aware of these facts? We are of the opinion that it is not reasonable to do so. The reasonable thing is to assume that both the appellant and his attorneys had knowledge of such facts. Inasmuch as Drs. Teopaco and Ordoñez had not been presented as witnesses for the appellant at the trial of the case in the first instance, said appellant cannot now allege that the facts stated in the medical certificates of said doctors are newly discovered facts. In the case of United States v. Luzon (4 Phil., 343), this court said: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"NEW TRIAL, MOTION FOR BASED UPON NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE. — A motion for a new trial, based upon newly discovered evidence, will not be granted unless the following conditions exist: (1) The evidence must have been discovered since the trial; (2) it must be such that with the use of reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant it could not have been secured on the former trial; (3) it must be material and not merely collateral or cumulative or corroborative or impeaching; (4) it must be such as ought to produce a different result on the merits on another trial; (5) it must go to the merits and not rest on a merely technical defense.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Now then, as the new evidence sought to be presented by the appellant is not of said nature, his motion for a new trial should have been denied. Therefore, the resolution of this court to the effect of granting a new trial of the case should be reconsidered and declared ineffectual. It is clear, therefore, that under whatever legal point of view the incident now before this court may be considered, the motion for reconsideration of the appellees must be granted. After discussing the case in all its legal aspects, permit us to consider it in its moral aspect. We maintain that even looking at it from this point of view, the petition of the appellant should not be granted. Morally and legally, the preponderance of the evidence on the existence or non-existence of an obligation is not binding. Morally, certainties alone are binding. Thus, to illustrate: A is not certain of being indebted to B. A, doubting whether he is indebted or not, is not morally bound to pay the debt, although the preponderance of the probability was that he might have contracted it. The reason for this is that, because it may happen, as in fact it does happen, that between two probabilities the greater might be incorrect or erroneous and the lesser the correct and true one, A could lawfully act either way, that is, choose between not complying with the doubtful obligation and complying therewith. He would be morally free to follow one course or another under the moral principle that in case of doubt, freedom of action (In dubiis libertas). In this connection, Henry Davis, S.J., Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology of Heythrop College, in his book \"Moral and Pastoral Theology\" (vol. 1, page 93) says: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"DEGREES IN OPINION. — Among men of all classes, some opinions are held to be morally certain, some are held as very probably true so that the contrary opinion is thought to be very improbable, others are held to be more probably true than their contrary, others, in fine, are merely probable, because they are motivated by good reasons, although the contrary opinion has better and more numerous reasons in its favour. In every case, either of the two contrary opinions may be the true one. \"When the truth of an opinion or the sufficiency of available evidence is debatable, one can never say that either the greater probability of one opinion does not and cannot destroy the probability of its contrary. Therefore, it must be admitted that in the conflict of two opposite probable opinions, since either may be false, it is not paradoxical to say that the less probable opinion may be the true one.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Now then, by applying this principle to the case at bar in its moral aspect, the distinguished Justices, who voted against the majority of this court when said majority affirmed the appealed judgment, denying the probate of the will in this case, they, the distinguished Justices who voted against the majority opinion, are not morally obliged to correct what they did believe and do believe to be an error of the majority, unless it be claimed that they were or are absolutely certain that the majority openly and evidently acted equivocally and erroneously. We do not wish to assume and we cannot assume that the present majority of this court hold such claim. These are the reasons why the undersigned dissents from the majority opinion in this case.\n",

      "VILLA-REAL, J. p. This an appeal taken by the accused-appellant Quan Kang from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 26th Judicial District, finding him guilty of violating Act No. 702 of the Philippine commission, having been found, according to the information, in the municipality of Mati, Province of Davao, Philippines, without the corresponding certificate of registration. The evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial does not show preponderantly that the herein accused-appellant was a Chinese laborer when he first came to the Philippines. On the other hand, the uncontradicted evidence presented by the accused shows that said accused was born in Canton, China, of Chinese-Filipino parents named Antonio Juan and Maria Lopez, natives of Manila. He first came to the Philippines with this father when he was only six years of age, residing at Santo Cristo Street, Manila, where his father had a store of sundry goods, commonly known as \"sari-sari\" store. After his father’s death, the herein accused-appellant continued to manage said store until the year 1911 when he went to Davao to establish himself in business opening stores first in the capital and later in the municipalities of Manay and Mati being still so engaged in the latter municipality. He never engaged in manual labor characteristic of laborers and wage earners. The fact that he did not register nor obtain a certificate of registration was due to his belief that he was not obliged to comply with the provisions of Act No. 702 of the Philippine Commission, being a merchant and the son of Chinese- Filipino parents. In finding the accused guilty of violating Act No. 702, the lower court based its opinion upon the fact that said accused, upon arraignment, pleaded guilty and admitted being a Chinese. Section 5 of Act No. 702 provides, among other things, that \"every Chinese person found without such certificate within the Philippine Islands after the expiration of the time limited by law for registration shall be presumed, in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese laborer and shall be subject to deportation as provided in section 4 of this Act.\" The presumption of being a Chinese laborer arising from the lack of certificate of registration, established by said section 5 of Act No. 702, is a disputable presumption and, according to said legal provision itself, yields to satisfactory proof to the contrary. This presumption has been destroyed by the evidence adduced by the accused-appellant at the trial to the effect that he was always engaged in commerce from the time he continued his father’s business upon the latter’s death. Consequently, as the herein accused-appellant does not have the status of Chinese laborer, the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 702, which he was found guilty of violating, are not applicable to him. The fact that he pleaded guilty upon arraignment is not equivalent to a confession that he is a Chinese laborer without a certificate of registration because it is not alleged in the information that he is a Chinese laborer but simply a \"Chinese.\" Consequently, upon pleading guilty he only admitted the fact that he was Chinese and that he did not have the corresponding certificate of registration, and this is how he understood it. The fact that a person is Chinese and has no certificate of registration does not necessarily imply that he is a laborer. Wherefore, the appealed judgment is reversed and the accused is acquitted of the information which is dismissed, with the costs de oficio. So ordered. Avanceña, C.J. , Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel and Concepcion, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Ante la Comision de Servicios Publicos los recurrentes promovieron el expediente No. 48983 para la revision de las tarifas comerciales e industriales de la recurrida Manila Electric Co. Ante la misma Comision esta pendiente otro expediente No. 45482 promovido para la revision de las tarifas residenciales de la misma recurrida Manila Electric Co. La Comision al resolver este ultimo expediente, no lo dio, sin embargo, por terminado sino que, con arreglo a las disposiciones del articulo 17 (a) de la Ley No. 146 del Commonwealth, ordeno a la Manila Electric Co. que someta para su revision sus tarifas comerciales e industriales. Viniendo por esta razon a versar ambos expedientes sobre peticion identica y en vista de que el abogado de los recurrentes en el expediente No. 48983 intervino tambien en representacion de los mismos recurrentes en el otro expediente No. 46482, la Comision, para simplificar los procedimientos y no multiplicar sin necesidad los expedientes, sobreseyo el No. 48983, con orden a los recurrentes en este expediente de que registren su comparecencia en el No. 46482 y en el otro No. 47991 que versa sobre las mismas tarifas, para que puedan tomar parte en ellos como partes interesadas y recurrentes. Los recurrentes presentaron ante esta Corte este presente recurso de certiorari contra la’Comision de Servicios Publicos y Manila Electric Co., alegando que aquella abuso de su discrecion, al ordenar el sobreseimiento del expediente No. 48983. Es visto, por lo expuesto, que la Comision de Servicios :Publicos, al sobreseer el expediente No. 48983 y acumularlo con los 46482 y 47991, por versar todos sobre identico objeto y a fin de simplificar los procedimientos y evitar la multiplicacion de expedientes, obro razonablemente dentro de su jurisdiccion, sin que en modo alguno esta resolucion pueda afectar a los derechos de los recurrentes, toda vez que pueden defenderlos en la misma extension que hubieran podido hacer en el expediente No. 48983 si este no hubiese sido sobreseido. Se deniega el recurso, con las costas a los recurrentes. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, Concepcion, y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En este expediente el Juzgado prorrogo el tiempo concedido a la Comision de Reclamaciones para su actuacion. La Comision, dentro de esta prorroga, admitio entre otras reclamaciones, la del abogado Ambrosio Calleja por la cantidad de P950, y el Juzgado ordeno a la administradora el pago de esta reclamacion. No habiendo la administradora hecho este pago, el Juzgado nombro administrador especial a Salustiano Zubeldia para que venda bienes del abintestato para hacer este pago. El administrador especial Zubeldia vendio, con este objeto, once parcelas de terreno y el Juzgado aprobo esta venta. Contra esta resolucion aprobando la venta se presento apelacion por la administradora y por Marcial Golingco, que pretende ser heredero del difunto. Se alega que el Juzgado prorrogo el plazo para admitir y considerar las reclamaciones ante la Comision mas alla del tiempo que la ley permite. Esta alegacion carece de fundamento. El articulo 689 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil faculta al Juzgado a prorrogar el plazo durante el cual podran los acreedores presentar sus reclamaciones a la Comision para su examen y admision hasta el tiempo maximo de diez y ocho meses. La notificacion hecha a los acreedores por la Comision para la presentacion de las reclamaciones contra el abintestato fue hecha el 25 de marzo de 1926. La primera prorroga concedida por el Juzgado el 21 de enero de 1927 fue por un mes y la segunda hasta el 31 de mayo de 1927. En esta misma fecha la Comision admitio la reclamacion de Calleja. Resulta, por tanto, que desde el 25 de marzo de 1926 hasta el 31 de mayo de 1927 no habian trascurrido los 18 meses dentro de los cuales el Juzgado podia, segun las circunstancias, prorrogar el plazo. Por otra parte, la reclamacion de Ambrosio Calleja fue presentada el 20 de mayo de 1926, o sea, a los dos meses de la notificacion hecha a los acreedores para la presentacion de reclamaciones. Los apelantes, al impugnar la actuacion del Juzgado concediendo las prorrogas, se fundan en que la notificacion a los acreedores para la presentacion de reclamaciones fue hecha el 25 de marzo de 1925. Pero, aparece que esta fecha es erronea, pues, segun la pieza de excepciones enmendada, la notificacion se hizo el 25 de marzo de 1926, y no el 25 de marzo de 1925. Como se ha dicho, la reclamacion de Ambrosio Calleja fue admitida por la Comision el 31 de mayo de 1927. El 11 de julio del mismo año los Comisionados presentaron al Juzgado su informe. La administradora apelo de este informe, en lo que respecta a la reclamacion de Ambrosio Calleja, el 8 de agosto siguiente, o sea, a los 28 dias de su presentacion, habiendo sido asi presentada despues del plazo de 25 dias fijados por la ley. El Juzgado, en efecto, declaro que esta apelacion de la administradora fue presentada fuera de tiempo y contra esta declaracion no se presento excepcion. El 4 de noviembre de 1927 el Juzgado ordeno a la administradora repetidas veces que pague a Ambrosio Calleja la cantidad reclamada de P950 y no habiendo cumplido esta orden, el Juzgado, el 22 de enero de 1935, nombro a Salustiano Zubeldia administrador especial para que venda en privado, o, en subasta publica, propiedades del abintestato suficientes a pagar a Ambrosio Calleja su reclamacion admitida, con sus intereses legales desde el 4 de noviembre de 1929. Salustiano Zubeldia vendio once parcelas de terreno del abintestato en cumplimiento de esta orden. El Juzgado aprobo esta venta. Contra esta aprobacion de la venta por el Juzgado se presento la apelacion en virtud de la cual la causa se halla ahora ante Nos para su decision. La apelacion descansa fundamentalmente en que el Juzgado carecia de jurisdiccion para prorrogar el plazo para la presentacion de reclamaciones a la Comision mas alla del tiempo maximo fijado por la ley. Por lo que hemos dicho antes sobre este punto esta pretension es completamente infundada. Por tanto, confirmamos la resolucion apelada con las costas a los apelantes. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, Concepcion y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El 17 de julio de 1919 Carlos Palanca obtuvo una sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Bulacan para el registro de cuatro parcelas de terreno, contiguas las unas a las otras y separadas solamente entre si por ciertas vias de agua llamadas esteros. Antes de que se dictara aquella sentencia y despues de practicadas las pruebas, el Gobierno por medio del Fiscal General, presento una peticion de reapertura del juicio para probar la existencia de esteros y rios navegables dentro del terreno, a fin de que se fije la situacion de los mismos en el plano y para que sean excluidos de la inscripcion. El Juzgado denego esta peticion por considerar innecesario reabrir la causa para tal objeto, pues, aun en el supuesto de que tales rios y esteros navegables existieran en el terreno, la inscripcion de este no afectaria a los derechos de propiedad del Gobierno Insular o del uso publico de dichas vias de comunicacion, que quedarian siempre a salvo con arreglo al articulo 39 de la Ley del Registro de Propiedad. Mas tarde el Gobierno de las Islas Filipinas presento la presente accion contra Carlos Palanca alegando que esta ilegalmente ocupando porciones del Rio Viray y del Estero Sapang Sedaria, que son navegables, y pide que sea obligado a abrirlos, dejandolos en su estado primitivo. El Juzgado sobreseyo esta accion; pero, elevada esta su resolucion al Tribunal de Apelaciones, este la revoco y declaro que dichos Rio Viray y Estero Sapang Sedaria son de dominio y uso publico y que el derecho adquirido por Carlos Panlanca sobre el terreno en el cual se hallan no puede afectar al derecho del Estado sobre los mismos, como bienes destinados al aprovechamiento publico. Carlos Palanca elevo a su vez en apelacion, mediante certiorari , esta decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones ante este Tribunal Supremo. El Tribunal de Apelaciones declaro, en vista de las pruebas presentadas en la causa, que el Rio Viray y el Estero Sapang Sedaria se hallan dentro del terreno de Carlos Palanca, que fue objeto de la decision del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Bulacan dictada el 17 de julio de 1919, y que dichos rio y estero son navegables y de aprovechamiento comun, sirven de comunicacion entre dos cursos de agua, que desembocan en la Bahia de Manila, y que las corrientes de agua en ellos son de dominio y aprovecha- miento publicos, utiles para el comercio, la navegacion y la pesca y que tenian estas condiciones cuando el predio que las comprende pertenecia aun al Estado. Siendo estos los hechos, la solicitud o el recurso entablado ante este Tribunal debe denegarse, confirmando asi la sentencia dictada por el Tribunal de Apelaciones. No hallamos fundada la pretension del recurrente de que la decision dictada por el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Bulacan el 17 de julio de 1919 y el titulo Torrens expedido, en su consecuencia, en favor de Carlos Palanca establece la no existencia del rio y estero en cuestion como navegables. En aquella decision, si bien se dijo que el terreno estaba cruzado por ciertas vias de agua llamadas esteros, no hay declaracion ninguna de que estos esteros no eran navegables. Por otra parte, cuando el Gobierno pidio oportunidad de probar que algunos de estos esteros eran navegables, el Juzgado le nego esta oportunidad por la razon de que, si en realidad eran navegables, el derecho del Gobierno a ellos, por razon de tal condicion, no quedaba afectado por la decision. Segun esto, la condicion del rio Viray y del Estero Sapang Sedaria, como navegables, no ha sido objeto de decision judicial. Por lo demas, siendo este rio y estero navegables, utiles para el comercio, la navegacion y la pesca, tienen el caracter de dominio publico y su condicion legal en este sentido no ha quedado afectado por la posesion de Carlos Palanca, cualquiera que haya sido el tiempo de esta posesion, porque no cabe prescripcion contra el Estado sobre bienes de dominio publico. Por estas consideraciones se deniega el recurso y se confirma la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Concepcion, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Se apela contra la resolucion del Juzgado dictada en esta causa estimando el demurrer presentado contra el demandante, entre otros fundamentos, por no alegar hechos suficientes a constituir motivo de accion. Son alegaciones de la demanda que Martinez Reyes, dueño de un terreno situado en Tanay, Rizal, con certificado original de titulo No. 156, murio intestado el 30 de octubre de 1935, sin dejar mas heredero que su hermano legitimo, el demandado Isidro Reyes; que este, despues de la muerte de Martinez Reyes, practico el 20 de julio de 1936 la particion extrajudicial de sus bienes; que, como consecuencia de esta particion, fue trasferido el certificado de titulo No. 156 a nombre de Isidro Reyes; que en la misma fecha, 20 de julio de 1936, Isidro Reyes vendio el mismo terreno a Aurora R. Trinidad a favor de la cual se expidio el certificado de trasferencia No. 30417. Alega, ademas, el demandante que Martinez Reyes, en vida, le debia la cantidad de P473.82, que no ha sido pagada hasta la fecha, y pide que el demandado Isidro Reyes sea obli- gado a promover judicialmente el expediente de abintestato de Martinez Reyes con el objeto de que en dicho expediente el demandante pueda reclamar el pago de su credito de P473.82. La particion extrajudicial practicada por Isidro Reyes sobre los bienes dejados por su difunto hermano Martinez, no habiendo otros interesados menores de edad, fue legal y valida de acuerdo con el articulo 596 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil. Aunque, segun el articulo 598 de la misma ley, en cualquier tiempo dentro de dos anos de verificada esta particion, pueden los bienes, o parte de los mismos, ser puestos en administracion judicial en caso de haber deudas no pagadas, esto solo puede hacerse mediante solicitud que debe ser presentada, no por el beneficiado en la particion extrajudicial, sino por el supuesto acreedor.

Por esta razon la pena adicional impuesta por el Juzgado es correcta.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Los esposos Don Joaquin Barrera Limjap y Dona Policarpia Nolasco tuvieron en su matrimonio dos hijos llamados Mariano Limjap y Nolasco y Jacinto Limjap y Nolasco. Despues del fallecimiento de Policarpia Nolasco los bienes gananciales con su esposo Joaquin Barrera Limjap fueron liquidados, asignandose la mitad a Joaquin Barrera Limjap y la otra mitad a sus dos hijos Mariano y Jacinto. Esto fue en 30 de abril de 1880. En la misma fecha, Joaquin Barrera Limjap, con todos estos bienes gananciales asi liquidados formo con sus hijos Mariano y Jacinto una sociedad general de bienes. Despues del fallecimiento de Joaquin Barrera Limjap sus hijos Mariano y Jacinto, el 14 de abril de 1893, con el objeto de proceder a la particion y adjudicacion de los bienes relictos por sus finados padres, formalizaron una escritura asignandose a cada uno, por mitad, los bienes que a cada cual debian corresponder. En la misma fecha y con los bienes que asi han correspondido a cada uno, formaron, en union con Candido Lim, la razon social \"Limjap y Compañia.\" A la expiracion del tiempo fijado para esta razon social, la misma fue disuelta el 6 de julio de 1896. En la misma fecha !os hermanos Mariano Limjap y Jacinto Limjap constituyeron entre los dos la razon social con la misma denominacion de \"Limjap y Compañia\" por el termino de tres años. Sin embargo, el 17 de noviembre de 1897 resolvieron disolver esta razon social \"Limjap y Compania\" y procedieron a su liquidacion, ayudados por Edilberto Calixto y Achuy. Como resultado de esta liquidacion el 6 de diciembre de 1897108 citados hermanos Mariano y Jacinto declararon haber recibido la parte que a cada uno correspondia de la razon social \"Limjap y Compañia\" disuelta. Finalmente, el julio de 1917, suscribieron un documento en el cual declararon liquidada y completamente cerradas todas las cuentas de la sociedad \"Limjap y Compañia.\" Jacinto Limjap fallecio dejando como unico hijo a German Limjap. Mariano Limjap fallecio tambien dejando varios hijos y una viuda, entre los cuales sus bienes fueron ya definitivamente distribuidos. German Limjap promovio despues esta accion contra Maria Escolar Vda. de Mariano Limjap, los hijos de esta y otros extranos a quienes fueron trasferidos algunos de los bienes dejados por el finado Don Mariano, reclamando su participacion en la herencia, que alega estar aun proindi- viso, dejada por sus abuelos Joaquin Barrera Limjap y Policarpia Nolasco. El Juzgado sobreseyo esta demanda y contra esta decision apelo el demandante German Limjap. Todo el fundamento de la accion del apelante se reduce a la alegacion de que la herencia dejada por los esposos Joaquin Barrera Limjap y Policarpia Nolasco estan aun proindiviso. El Juzgado llego a la conclusion de que dicha herencia ya fue distribuida entre Mariano y Jacinto y que cada cual recibio la porcion correspondiente. Si esta conclusion es correcta el demandante carece de todo derecho para pedir su participacion en la herencia de sus abuelos Joaquin Barrera Limjap y Policarpia Nolasco. La conclusion del Juzgado en el sentido de que los bienes dejados por Joaquin Barrera Limjap y Policarpia Nolasco fueron ya distribuidos y entregados a Mariano y Jacinto hallamos completamente probado por la escritura notarial suscrita por estos en la cual procedieron a la particion y adjudicacion de estos bienes entre ambos. Aunque despues con las respectivas porciones que les correspondieron en esta herencia continuaron negociando y organizaron mas tarde la razon social \"Limjap y Compania\", esta sociedad fue tambien finalmente disuelta y distribuidos entre ambos los bienes que la constituyeron. Debe notarse que las propiedades, objeto de la reclamacion, tienen sus titulos Torrens, sin que en los tramites para su expedicion hayan presentado oposicion el apelante ni su padre. Los bienes dejados por Don Mariano Limjap estan ya dlstribuidos hace años entre sus herederos, mediante el correspondiente procedimiento judicial, sin que el apelante haya presentado objecion a esta distribucion, no obstante haber intervenido en el procedimiento para aceptar y recibir un legado que Don Mariano Limjap dejo en su favor. Todo esto indica que el apelante no creia tener derecho a participar en los bienes que ahora reclama. Confirmamos la sentencia apelada con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Diaz, Laurel y Concepcion, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En el abintestato de Silverio de la Cruz promovido por Antonina del Rosario, esta, despues de los tramites correspondientes, fue nombrada administradora. Como tal administradora, presento en aquel expediente su cuenta final con un saldo en contra de la administracion y a favor de ella en la cantidad de P604. Para cobrar este credito pidi. del Juzgado para vender un terrero bajo su administracion, con titulo expedido a nombre de los herederos legales de Silverio de la Cruz El Juzgado concedio esta autorizacion y de acuerdo con ella Antonina del Rosario, como tal administradora judicial, vendio dicho terreno a Leonora de Leon por la cantidad de P400. Otorgada la escritura correspondiente de esta venta, la misma fue aprobada por el Juzgado. Como consecuencia de estos tramites el titulo de propiedad del terreno vendido fue trasferido a nombre de la compradora Leonora de Leon a cuyo nombre se expidio otro certificado de trasferencia por registrador de titulos. Cuando Leonora de Leon quizo tomar posesion del terreno por ella comprado, se encontro con la oposicion de Ursula Esguerra, quien presento entonces en el expediente de abintestato de Silverio de la Cruz una peticion para que se dejen sin efecto las ordenes dictadas para la venta del terreno. Proveyendo a esta peticion de Ursula Esguerra. sin que Leonora de Leon fuera notificada de la misma y sin que interviniera en su consideracion, el Juzgado dejo sin efecto la orden nombrando administradora judicial a Antonina del Rosario, la orden aprobando la cuenta de esta y la orden para la venta del terreno, y autorizo a Ursula Esguerra a incoar la accion correspondiente para la nulidad de la venta del terreno. Ursula Esguerra, que fue nombrada despues administradora del abintestato de Silverio de la Cruz por haberse dejado sin efecto el nombramiento de Antonina del Rosario, presento esta accion contra Leonora de Leon para la nulidad de la venta del terreno hecha a ella. El Juzgado declaro nula la venta del terreno hecha por Antonina del Rosario a favor de Leonora de Leon y contra esta resolucion Leonora de Leon presento la apelacion que ahora es objeto de nuestra consideracion. Resulta de lo expuesto que Leonora de Leon es, en toda la extension de la palabra, una compradora de buena fe. El terreno que ella compro aparecia a nombre de los herederos de Silverio de la Cruz y la venta la hizo Antonina del Rosario, como administradora del abintestato de Silverio de la Cruz debidamente nombrada y autorizada para hacer la venta. En tales circunstancias Leonora de Leon tenia derecho a descansar en la presuncion de que las ordenes dictadas por el Juzgado eran legales. Por tanto, con revocacion de la sentencia apelada, se absuelve de la demanda a las demandadas con las costas a la apelada. Asi se ordena.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En este expediente No. 1856 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Nueva Ecija, Alberto C. Garcia solicito el agosto de 1928 el registro de una parcela de terreno de 352 hectareas de extension. Ysidra Co.iuangco se opuso a esta solicitud en cuanto al lote 84, que ahora es lote \"A-1\" alegando que lo compro de Simon Sawit. El Juzgado adjudico el lote \"A-1\" a Ysidra Cojuangco y el 10 de septiembre de 1938 expidi6 el correspondiente decreto de registro en nombre de ella. El 21 de marzo de 1938 Eugenio Sawit y’ otros presentaron una peticion para que fuera revocado dicho decreto por haber sido obtenido mediante fraude. No obstante esta peticion de Eugenio Sawit y otros, el 10 de septiembre de 1938, a instancia de Ysidra Cojuangco, el Hon. Juez Jose Maria Paredes, que entonces presidia el Juzgado de Nueva Ecija, ordeno que se entregara a aquella por el sheriff la posesion del terreno. Sawit y otros pidieron la reconsideracion de esta orden. Habiendo sido trasladado despues a otro juzgado el Hon. Jose Maria Paredes y habiendo sido sustituido por el Hon. Guillermo F. Pablo, este, proveyendo favorablemente a la reconsideracion solicitada por Eugenio Sawit y otros, dicto una orden revocando la del Hon. Juez Paredes. En virtud de los hechos expuestos Ysidra Cojuangco presento ante el Tribunal de Apelaciones una demanda de certiorari contra el Hon. Juez Guillermo F. Pablo y Eugenio Sawit y otros alegando que aquel obro con exceso y abuso de su discrecion al dictar su orden revocando la del de Juez Paredes, sin exigir de Eugenio Sawit y otros la prestacion de una fianza a favor de ella. El Tribunal de Apelaciones, por una mayoria, denego el recurso. La causa se halla ahora ante este Tribunal Supremo para la revision de esta decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Despues de haber revisado las cuestiones legales envueltas en este recurso, somos de opinion que la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones debe confirmarse. El Hon. Juez Guillermo F. Pablo tenia jurisdiccion para actuar sobre la reconsideracion pedida por Eugenio Sawit de la resolucion del Juez Paredes concediendo la posesion del lote a la recurrente. El Hon. Juez Pablo era Juez del mismo Juzgado en que estaba pendiente el asunto y tenia jurrisdiccion para reconsiderar la resolucion dictada por el Hon. Juez Paredes, a quien sustituyo, de la misma manera y en la misma extension en que este hubiera podido hacerlo, si no hubiese sido trasladado a otro Juzgado y hubiese seguido siendo Juez del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Nueva Ecija. Por otra parte, las circunstancias del caso demuestran que el Hon. Juez Guillermo F. Pablo no abuso de su jurisdiccion, sino que uso de ella debidamente. Sawit y otros estaban en posesion del lote antes de la presentacion de la solicitud de registro, continuan hasta ahora en esta posesion y tienen siembras de palay en el terreno actualmente, mientras que la solicitante, que alega haber comprado de ellos este lote, nunca ha tenido posesion del mismo. Si la peticion de revision prospera, la ejecucion del decreto en estas circunstancias causaria a Sawit y otros mayores perjuicios que los que sufriria la recurrente si no se ejecuta, aun en el caso de que la revision sea denegada. Por lo demas, el decreto de registro del lote en favor de la recurrente no es final, en vista de haberse pedido su anulacion por Sawit y otros por haberse obtenido mediante fraude. Segun el articulo 38 de la Ley No. 496, como esta enmendada, este decreto puede ser aun revisado y esta sujeto todavia al derecho de Sawit y otros, que alegan haber sido privados de la propiedad del lote. Presentada por Sawit y otros la peticion de revision de este decreto, por haberse obtenido mediante fraude, por lo mismo que puede ser revocado, no tiene caracter final y su ejecucion no es de pleno derecho. No hallamos merito en la pretension de la recurrente de que, en todo caso, debia haberse exigido de Sawit y otros que prestaran fianza en favor de la recurrente para suspender el efecto del decreto en cuanto a la posesion, aplicando la disposicion del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil (articulo 144), que se refiere a la ejecucion de la sentencia despues de presentada una apelacion. Aun suponiendo aplicable esta disposicion, es, de todos modos, discrecional en el Juzgado el ordenar la ejecucion, si hay razones especiales para ello. En el caso presente las razones, como hemos indicado, militan, al contrario, para que no se ejecute. Se deniega el recurso y se confirma la decision dictada por el Tribunal de Apelaciones, con las costas a la apelante. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Dulz, Laurel y Concepion, MM, estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandante Leonardo Guison es dueño de la lancha de vapor \"Marta\" y la demandada Philippine Fish Company es dueña de la lancha de motor \"Manila X\", ambas de la matricula del Puerto de Manila. En la manana del 4 de marzo de 1936 ambas lanchas, hallandose maniobrando respectivamente en la bocana del Rio Pasig, tuvieron una colision que dio por resultado el que la lancha \"Marta\" se hundiera, causando al demandante danos por valor de P10,197.24. El demandante presento esta accion contra la demandada para el cobro de esta cantidad de P10,197.24 que importan los danos sufridos por el, por causa de la colision. El Juzgado, habiendo llegado a la conclusion de que la colision fue debida a la imprudencia y negligencia del patron de la lancha \"Manila X\", sin ninguna negligencia contributiva por parte del patron de la \"Marta\", condeno a la demandada a pagar al demandante la cantidad reclamada. La demandada pidio la reconsideracion de esta sentencia para que se declare que su responsabilidad, de acuerdo con el articulo 837 del Codigo de Comercio, esta limitada al valor de su lancha. El Juzgado, el 22 de enero de 1937, accediendo a la peticion de la demandada, modifico su decision en el sentido de que se entienda limitada la responsabilidad de la demandada al valor de la lancha \"Manila X.\" El demandante presento excepcion contra esta resolucion del Juzgado enmendando su decision original en el sentido expuesto. Toda la cuestion que se suscita en esta apelacion se reduce a si la responsabilidad de la demandada, en las circunstancia, de este caso, esta limitada al valor de la lancha. El articulo 837 del Codigo de Comercio asi lo declara terminantemente. En este mismo sentido este Tribunal aplico esta disposicion en la causa Philippine Shipping Co. contra Garcia, declarando que el derecho maritimo es de caracter exclusivamente real y limita la responsabilidad del naviero al valor de la nave (6 Jur. Fil., 291). Por lo demas, la lancha \"Manila X\", que es una embarcacion que sirve para navegar por agua dulce o salada, apta para recibir y trasportar personas o cosas, entra en el concepto general de la palabra buque que se emplea en el articulo 837 del Codigo de Comercio. No se hace mencion en la decision apelada de circunstancia alguna que excluya de este concepto a la lancha \"Manila X.\" Se dice que esta lancha \"Manila X\" siguio en la posesion de la demandada por mas de diez meses despues de la colision hasta que tuvo otra con otra embarcacion, habiendo desmerecido de valor por esta causa. Esto, sin embargo, se habria evitado si el demandante se hubiera apoderado de la lancha inmediatamente despues de la colision, como garantia de su credito, cuyo caracter real le daba derecho a ello. Se corfirma la sentencia apelada con las costas al apelante. asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Diaz, Laurel, Concepcion y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El recurrente Federico R. Castro desde 1928 estaba autorizado a mentener un servicio irregular de auto-trucks en nueve rutas. Mas tarde, en abril de 1937, una de estas lineas, Iloilo-Igbaras via Guimbal y Tubungan, fue cancelada. Ahora el recurrente solicita de la Comision de Servicios Publicos la conversion de su servicio irregular en regular en las lineas Iloilo-Lambunao via Janiuay e Iloilo-Igbaras via Guimbal y Tubungan. En cuanto a la linea Iloilo-Igbaras via Guimbal y Tubungan, por haber sido ya cancelada desde 1937, la Comision se abstuvo de considerar la solicitud. Despues de oir las pruebas, la Comision cancelo el certificado anterior expedido en favor del recurrente para un servicio irregular en las siete lineas y le autorizo a mantener un servicio regular en la linea Iloilo-Lambunao via Janiuay bajo las condiciones que se specifican en su decision, ordenando la retencion de los ocho auto-trucks usados en el servicio irregular para ser usados en el servicio regular que se le autorizaba en la unica linea de Iloilo-Lambunao via Janiuay. El recurrente apela contra la decision de la Comision de Servicios Publicos (a) por haber cancelado la autorizacion que tenia para mantener un servicio irregular en las siete lineas; (b) por no haberlo concedido para el servicio regular que solicita, las horas pedidas en su solicitud; (c) y por haber mantenido, para su servicio regular en la linea Iloilo-Lambunao via Janiuay, las restricciones que estaban impuestas en su anterior servicio irregular. No hallamos merito en esta apelacion. El recurrente pidio la conversion de su servicio irregular en regular, limitando este a las dos lineas que se mencionan en su solicitud. Esto implicaba que renuncia y abandona todo su servicio irregular para convertirlo en regular en las dos unicas rutas que menciona en su solicitud. Asi entendio con razon la Comision y por esto cancelo su servicio irregular, lo cual, por otra parte, coincide con la politica de suprimir los servicios irregulares como mas conveniente al publico. En cuanto a las horas que solicita el recurrente y no le fueron concedidas por la Comision, resulta que algunas de ellas son precisamente las horas que le estaban prohibidas en su servicio irregular anterior y las otras son horas incompatibles con las autorizadas a la Panay Autobus en esta misma linea. Por lo que respecta a las restricciones que se imponen al recurrente en el serviclo regular que se le autoriza, resulta que son las mismas restricciones impuestas anterior-mente en su servicio irregular y cuyo levantamiento no ha pedido en la presente solicitud. Se confirma la decision de la Comision de Servicios Publicos con las costas al recurrente. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Concepcion, Laurel y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En la actuacion especial No. 1317 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Cebu titulada Testamentaria del Finado Carlos A. Salvador, era administradora la recurrente Maria Ylaya, viuda del difunto. El 10 de marzo de 1930 se dicto decision en aquel expediente, declarando que Ciriaca Torres y Asma y Teodora Ylagan y Torres son las unicas y universales herederas del difunto Carlos A. Salvador con derecho a heredar los bienes que dejo, con sujecion solamente al derecho usufructuario de la Viuda Maria Ylaya y al pago de los legados dispuestos en su testamento. El 13 de junio de 1931 el Juzgado dicto un auto por el cual, considerando que todos los legados y deudas y el impuesto de herencia estaban pagados, declaro terminada la testamentaria. Las recurridas Ciriaca Torres y Asma y Teodora Ylagan alegan, ademas, que fue asignado a ellas, como parte de su herencia, un credito de P682 contra Alfredo Mercado a favor del difunto Carlos A. Salvador. En el tiempo en que se declaro terminado este expediente, estaba pendiente en los tribunales la accion civil entablada por la recurrente Maria Ylaya, como administradora de la testamentaria, para el cobro de este credito de P682. El 9 de septiembre de 1933 se dicto decision final en aquella accion civil en favor de la recurrente, como tal administradora de la testamentaria del finado Carlos A. Salvador. El 7 de marzo de 1938 las recurridas Cirlaca Torres Y Asma y Teodora Ylagan presentaron en este expediente No. 1317 un escrito pidiendo su reapertura para que se ordene a la recurrente, como administradora que fue en el mismo, traspase a las recurridas los derechos declarados en aquella sentencia para el cobro de los P682. El Juzgado, en su auto de 22 de marzo de 1938, proveyo favorablemente a esta peticion y ordeno la reapertura de este expediente. Esta orden fue reiterada el 23 de julio de 1938 y el 19 de abril de 1939. La recurrente ahora promueve este recurso de certiorary, alegando que las ordenes dictadas por el Juzgado el 22 de marzo de 1938, el 23 de julio de 1938 y el 19 de abril de 1939 fueron dictadas sin jurisdiccion y con abuso de discrecion y pide que sean declaradas nulas. En vista de los hechos expuestos somos de opinion que procede conceder la solicitud. El expediente No. 1317 titulado Testamentaria del Finado Carlos A. Salrador fue declarado terminado el 13 de junio de 1931. Cuando el Juzgado ordeno su reapertura el 22 de marzo de 1938 y dicto las ordenes de 23 de julio de 1938 y 19 de abril de 1939 carecia ya de jurisdiccion para actuar en dicho expediente. No hay disposicion legal que autorice esta reapertura. Tampoco hay razon que la justifique. El traspaso a las recurridas de los derechos derivados de la decision para el cobro de los P682, por parte de la recurrente como administradora de la testamentaria del finado Carlos A. Salvador, no justifica la reapertura. Aquella accion fue ejercitada por la recurrente como administradora de esta testamentaria. Despues ceso en su cargo al ser declarada terminada la testamentaria. Las recurridas pretenden ser las unicas herederas declaradas en la testamentaria y, ademas, alegan que se les asigno, como parte de su herencia, el credito de P682. Podian, por consiguiente, haber solicitado en aquella accion civil su substitucion en lugar de la recurrente para los efectos de la sentencia que en ella se dicto y, en todo caso, pueden ejercitar ahora, sin necesidad de reabrir la testamentaria, cualquiera accion contra la recurrente en relacion con la referida cantidad de P682, si ya ha sido paganda a ella.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Los apelantes fueron condenados en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila por violacion de la seccion 2, en relacion con las secciones 7 y 8, de la Ley No. 2581 de la Legislatura Filipina, conocida por \"Blue Sky Law.\" Declararon ser culpables de la violacion acusada y fueron condenados, cada uno, a pagar una multa de P200, con la prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia, y la parte proporcional de las costas del juicio. Lo unico que los apelantes alegan en esta instancia es que la pena impuesta a ellos es excesiva y debe ser reducida. La pena seiialada por la ley a la violacion acusada es la de una multa no mayor de P10,000 o prision que no exceda de cinco años, o, ambas penas. Dada esta extension de la pena señalada a la violacion, no puede considerarse excesiva la impuesta por el Juzgado. No es aplicable el caso de \"People contra Rosenthal\", que los apelantes invocan, pues, en aquel el Tribunal declaro que el acusado habia obrado de buena fe y habia restituido a los interesados el importe de las acciones, circunstancias que no concurren en este caso. El Procurador General por su parte pide que la pena impuesta sea aumentada. La pena impuesta por el Juzgado esta dentro de los limites que la ley le permite imponer, segun su discrecion. No hallamos razon para alterar el juicio del Juzgado en el uso de esta discrecion. Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas a los apelantes. Asi se ordena. Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, Concepcion y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El apelante fue acusado en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila del delito de hurto de efectos por valor de P55. Se alega ademas en la querella que el apelante fue ya previamente declarado culpable, el 29 de julio y 2 de Septiembre de 1937, de los delitos de hurto y robo respectivamente, ambos cometidos el 25 de julio del mismo año. El apelante declaro ser culpable del delito acusado. El Juzgado le condeno a cuatro meses y un dia de arresto mayor y a la pena adicional de dos anos, cuatro meses y un dia de prision correccional, como delincuente habitual y a indemnizar al ofendido en la cantidad de P55, con la prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia. El delito acusado esta castigado por el articulo 309 del Codigo Penal Revisado y la pena impuesta esta de acuerdo con esta disposicion. Las dos previas convicciones del apelante fueron por delitos cometidos en la misma fecha y no constituyen delincuencia habitual, pues, deben ser consideradas a este efecto como una sola conviccion. (Pueblo contra Venus, 35 Gac. Of., 991; Pueblo contra Santiago, 55 Jur. Fil., 284.)

El recurrido apelo contra esta decision ante el Tribunal de Apelaciones, en el cual el Procurador General pidlo que el recurrido fuera ademas condenado por el delito de falsificacion de documentos publicos.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El 9 mayo de 1933 Veronica Padilla compro de la recurrida un truck de segunda mano al precio de P1,561, firmado al efecto dos pagares, uno de P50 y otro de P1,511. Para garantizar el saldo de estoe pagares, Veronioca Padilla hipoteco mismo truck. No pudo ella saldar con regularidad los pagares en los terminos convenidos y el 23 de junio de 1934 debia aun la cantidad de P1,300, por lo que en esta fecha firmo a favor de la recurrida otro pagare por este saldo, cuyo pago aseguro con la hipoteca del mismo truck y, ademas, con la fianza solidaria prestada por su padre, Vicente Padilla. En este segundo pagare se hace constar que el mismo fue otorgado en sustitucion de los anteriores. Este segundo pagare tampoco fue pagado, segun ls convenido quedando del mismo, sin pagar, la cantidad de P1,080 el marzo de 1935. Por esta razon la recurrida ejecuto la hipoteca sobre el truck, el cual fue vendido a ls misma recurrida como mejor postora por la cantidad de s150. No cubriendo este precio obtenido en la venta el importe de la obligacion, la recurrida presento esta accion para que se dicte contra Veronica Padilla y su padre Vicente Padilla sentencia adicional por el resto de la obligacion no pagada, o sea, la cantidad de P930, mas s115 52 y P75.86 como intereses de la cantidad reclamada y por reparaciones del truck, respectivamente. Vicente Padilla y Veronica Padilla se opusieron a esta peticion, pero, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia proveyo favorablemente a ella y dicto la sentencia adicional que se ha solicitado. Apelada la causa al Tribunal de Apelacione.s este confirmo la sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia. Ahora Vicente Padilla y Veronica Padilla recurren ante este Tribunal en apelacion mediante certiorari contra la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. La principal contencion de los recurrentes en esta instancia es que la recurrida no tiene derecho a la sentencia adicional con arreglo a la Ley 4122. Pero, la Ley 4122, que empezo a regir el 9 de diciembre de 1933, no es aplicable a la obligacion contraida por los recurrentes el 9 de mayo de 1933. Se sostiene, sin embargo, que la obligacion original de los recurrentes contraida el 9 de mayo de 1933, fue novada por el segundo pagare suscrito por los mismos el 23 de junio de 1934 despues ya de haber entrado en vigor la Ley 4122. No hubo, sin embargo, tal novacion. Como;e dice en el segundo pagare, este era mera sustitucion de 103 expedidos el 9 de mayo de 1933, garantizado con la misma hipoteca y, en adicion, con la fianza prestada por el otro recurrente Vicente Padilla. En este respecto es completamente aplicable lo que esta Corte dijo en la causa de Levy Hermanos Inc. contra Simeon Capule (G. R. No. 44304): jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"La extension del pagare en 5 de enero de 1934 no puede considerarse como novacion de las transacciones de 31 de mayo de 1933 por referirse a la misma deuda, aunque reducida por los pagos hechos a su cuenta. En realidad lo unico que se ha hecho fue trasladar a otro documento la constancia de la misma deuda. Fue meramente sustitucion de un documento por otro sobre la misma transaccion. Es verdad que se han estipulado diferentes terminos, mas beneficiosos para su pago que los convenidos anteriormente, pero, ello no arguye novacion.\" (Sentencia del Tribunal Supremo de Espana de 19 de noviembre de 1894.) Si el segundo sagare de 23 de junio de 1934 no ha novado sla obligacion contraida por los recurrentes el 7 de mayo de 1933, es visto que la Ley 4122, que solo empezo a regir el 9 de diciembre de 1933, no es aplicable. En cuanto a la obligacion de Vicente Padilla la cuestion es perfectamente clara. Segun los terminos del pagare que suscribio el 23 de junio de 1934, su obligacion es pagar mancomunada y solidariamente con la otra recurrente Veronica Padilla la obligacion que esta habia contraida en favor de la demandante. Invocan tambien los recurrentes en su favor la equidad y alegan que los beneficios que trata de obtener la demandante en la transaccion son claramente usurarios. Pero, las consideraciones que se aducen en este respecto se fundan en una transaccion anterior que la recurrida tuvo con otra sobre el mismo truck, cuando era nuevo. Ambas transacciones son completamente independientes entre si. Por estas consideraciones se deniega el recurso y se confirma la decision de la Corte de Apelaciones, con las costas a los recurrentes. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El 28 de octubre de 1929 se expidio, como homestead, a nombre de Amado Villanueva el certificado original de titulo de un terreno No. 3008, que fue registrado en la oficina del Registro de Titulo de la Provincia de Nueva Ecija el 20 de noviembre del mismo año. El 5 y el 26 de agosto y el 8 de septiembre de 1934 dicho Amado Villanueva contrajo, en favor de los esposos Mariano Paras y Felicidad Juane, deudas que se comprometio a pagar el ultimo dia de febrero de 1935. No habiendo cumplido con esta obligacion, los acreedores, mediante la accion correspondiente, obtuvieron del juzgado de paz de Nueva l:cija el septiembre de 1937 una sentencia para el pago de esta deuda. El 9 de noviembre del mismo año 1937 el sheriff de Nueva Ecija embargo este terreno obtenido por Amado Villanueva como homestead y despues lo vendio en publica subasta, añotandose esta venta el 10 de diciembre de 1937 en el respaldo del certificado de titulo. A peticion de Amado Villanueva, presentada en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Nueva Ecija, este, con oposicion de los esposos Paras, ordeno la cancelacion de esta andacion por considerar nula la venta del terreno. Los esposos Paras apelaron contra esta resolucion. La cuestion que se somete a nuestra consideracion en esta apelacion es si podia haberse vendido legalmente el terreno de Amado Villanueva, siendo un homestead. La Ley 2874, seccion 116, como ha sido enmendada por la Ley 3517, seccion 23 y, ultimamente, por la Ley 141 del Commonwealth, dispone que los terrenos adquiridos por titulo gratuito o homestead no estaran sujetos a gravamen ni enajenacion desde la fecha de la aprobacion de la soli- citud y durante los cinco años siguientes a la fecha de la expedicion del titulo o concesion, ni responderan al pago de ninguna obligacion contraida con anterioridad a la terminacion de aquel periodo. No se discute que la deuda por la cual se dicto sentencia contra Amado Villanueva fue contraida el agosto y septiembre de 1934, dentro de cinco años de expedido el titulo de su homestead el octubre de 1929. Pero, se dice que, aunque fueron suscritos el agosto y septiembre de 1934 los pagares que acreditan la deuda, su pago no era exigible sino el febrero de 1935, despues de trascurridos cinco años desde que fue expedido el titulo. Esto, sin embargo, no constituye ninguna defensa, pues, la ley no habla de la obligacion que sea exigible, sino de la que se contraiga dentro de los cinco años y, en este caso, la deuda fue contraida dentro de este periodo despues de expedido el articulo. Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En el mes de abril de 1931 Tavera-Luna, Inc., era dueiia del edificio conocido con el nombre de \"Crystal Arcade,\" entonces en construccion, situada en esta Ciudad de Manila Este edificio estaba sujeto a hipoteca a favor de El Hogar Filipino para asegurar el pago de un prestamo. En aquella fecha Tavera-Luna, Inc., empleo a Gaston O’Farrell para que gestione el arrendamiento de los compartimientos del edificio, percibiendo como comision la renta correspondiente al primer mes de los compartimientos cuyo arrendamiento Consiga. Por gestiones de Gaston O’Farrell el establecimiento de Syyap Tailoring Co., Inc., ocupo el compartimiento No. 103 del edificio a fines del febrero de 1932, y el No. 107 en junio del mismo ano, habiendo sido pagado el marzo de aquel aiio la renta de P1,000 del primer mes por el compartimiento 103 y la de P345 el junio del mismo ano por el compartimiento 107. Sucedio tambien que el 11 del febrero de 1932 la administracion del edificio paso al Hogar Filipino el cual fue el que recibio la primera renta mensual de los compartimientos 103 y 107, como se ha mencionado antes. Gaston O’Farrell no recibio esta primera renta de los compartimientos 103 y 107 ni de Luna-Tavera, Inc., ni del Hogar Filipino cuando este se encargo de la administracion del edificio. El Hogar Filipino continuo esta administracion hasta el 28 de septiembre de 1933 en que, despues de la liquidacion de la deuda de Tavera-Luna, Inc., el edificio fue vendido en publica subasta al mismo Hogar Filipino. Todos los beneficios liquidos obtenidos por el Hogar Filipino durante su administracion del edificio fueron imputados al pago de la deuda de Tavera-Luna, Inc., al hacerse esta liquidacion. En virtud de estos hechos Gaston O’Farrell presento esta accion para reclamar de El Hogar Filipino y de Tavera-Luna, Inc., el pago de la cantidad de P1,375, como primera renta de los compartimientos 103 y 107 del edificio, pagada por Syyap Tailoring Co., Inc. El Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila absolvio de la demanda al Hogar Filipino y condeno a Tavera-Luna, Inc., a pagar al demandante la cantidad reclamada con sus intereses desde el 7 de enero de 1935. Contra esta decision apelo el demandante. En nuestra opinion la decision apelada debe confirmarse. No hay cuestion de que el demandante tiene derecho a la cantidad que reclama en virtud del contrato que celebro con Tavera-Luna, Inc. La cuestion esta en si es el Hogar Filipino el que tiene la obligacion de pagarle esta cantidad. Segun los hechos expuestos, el Hogar Filipino, al liquidar su administracion del edificio, imputo al pago de la deuda de Tavera-Luna, Inc., todo el benefisio liquido que se obtuvo en su administracion. No habiendose pagado al demandante los P1,375 a que tenia derecho en virtud del contrato de comision que celebro con Tavera-Luna, Inc., esta cantidad formo parte de la ganancia liquida de la administracion que luego se imputo al pago de la deuda de Tavera-Luna Inc. Aunque esta cantidad fue entregada al Hogar Filipino, como administradora del edificio, sin embargo, por haber sido imputada al pago de la deuda de Tavera-Luna Inc., esta corporacion, en ultimo termino, viene a ser quien la recibio y se beneficio de ella por no haberse hecho al demandante el pago de su comision. Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Concepcion, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "CONCEPCION, Mp: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Se trata de una peticion de certiorari contra una orden dictada por el Honorable Juez Roman A. Cruz del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Ilocos Norte. Los recurrentes Ignacio Miguel y otros habian comprado tres parcelas de terreno de Valeriana Pimentel despues de que esta habia sido condenada en una causa civil a pagar a los demandantes Alejandro Andres y otros, cierta suma de dinero. Al ejecutarse la sentencia, fueron embargadas dos de dichas tres parcelas de terreno, con protesta de los recurrentes que no solo las habian comprado, sino que estaban en posesion de ellas. Prestada la fianza correspondiente por los recurridos, las referidas parcelas fueron vendidas en publica subasta a Sotero Barroga, quien transfirio todos sus derechos sobre ellas a los aqui recurridos Alejandro Andres y otros. Estos solicitaron y obtuvieron inmediatamente posesion judicial no solamente de las dos parcelas que habian comprado, sino tambien de la tercera que no habia sido vendida en la subasta. Los recurrentes, para evitar litigios, verificaron la redencion de dichas parcelas, no obstante haberlas ya adquirido a titulo de compra de la propietaria original Valeriana Pimentel. Asi las cosas, los recurridos Alejandro Andres y otros se negaron a desocupar y a entregar las referidas tres parcelas a los recurrentes; de aqui que estos ejercitaron la accion de reivindicacion contra Alejandro Andres y otros, causa civil No. 2672 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Ilocos Norte, R.G. No. 30475 de este Tribunal Supremo, por quien se confirmo el titulo de los recurrentes a las mencionadas parcelas en la referida causa de reivindicacion. En septiembre de 1929, el Sheriff Delegado, tratando de dar cumplimiento a un mandamiento de ejecucion expedido el 9 de septiembre de 1929 en la causa de reivindicacion a que acabamos de referirnos, entrego indebidamente a los recurrentes Ignacio Miguel y otros, la posesion de tres parcelas de terreno, con mayor extension, puesto que la primera se describia con una extension de 9 hectareas, debiendo ser solamente de 4 hectareas, segun la descripcion hecha en el mandamiento de posesion arriba mencionado; la segunda, con una superficie de 1 hectarea, debiendo ser de 50 areas; y la tercera, con 5 hectareas, no debiendo tener mas que 90 areas. En 8 de octubre de 1929 los recurrentes presentaron contra los recurridos (causa civil No. 3221) una accion sobre interdicto prohibitorio para que aquellos se abstuviesen de molestar a los recurrentes en la posesion de las tres parcelas descritas en la demanda. Como quiera que las parcelas entregadas a los recurrentes en la diligencia de posesion eran de mayor extension que las que en el mandamiento de posesion se describen, los recurridos, en 12 de octubre de 1929, pidieron, por una mocion, que se declarasen nulas y de ningun valor las diligencias de posesion practicadas por el Sheriff Delegado, y que se expidiese un nuevo mandamiento a fin de que se entregaran a los recurrentes los terrenos objeto de ejecucion, que se describirian en dicho nuevo mandamiento. Antes de que el Juzgado actuase sobre la mencionada mocion, los recurrentes consiguieron que se dictase la orden de interdicto prohibitorio preliminar de 14 de octubre de 1929, y desde entonces los recurridos dejaron de poseer porcion alguna de los terrenos objeto de la mencionada ejecucion. Pendiente la accion de interdicto, el Juzgado resolvio la mocion de los recurridos de fecha 12 de octubre de 1929 dictando la orden de 12 de noviembre del mismo ano, por la cual declaro que procedia expedirse un nuevo mandamiento de ejecucion de acuerdo con lo pedido en dicha mocion, sugiriendo que el Sheriff fuese acompaiiado de un agrimensor para que por este se determinase la verdadera extension de las Parcelas que debian ser entregadas a los recurrentes. En 11 de febrero de 1930, cumpliendo con la anterior orden del Juzgado, el Escribano expidio otro mandamiento de ejecucion, y el Sheriff Teofilo Mata, asesorado por el Agrimensor Marcelo Barba, constituyendose en el lugar de los terrenos en cuestion, hizo entrega a los recurrentes, en 1. de marzo de 1930, de los terrenos identificados en la diligencia de ejecucion y representados en un plano como lotes 1, 3 y 7, con una extension superficial cada uno de 4 hectareas, 50 areas y 47 centiareas, y 90 areas y 42 centiareas, respectivamente. Ademas de estos tres lotes, el mismo plano demuestra otros cuatro lotes, los cuales, segun los recurridos, estaban en su posesion antes del 13 de septiembre de 1929 cuando el Sheriff hizo entrega indebidamente a los recurrentes no solo de los tres lotes arriba mencionados, sino tambien de los cuatro ultimamente citados, haciendo aparecer todos los siete lotes como tres parcelas solamente. Los recurrentes, debido a la orden de interdicto prohibitorio, continuaron en posesion de dichos cuatro ultimos lotes. En 24 de septiembre de 1934, el Juzgado dicto decision en la causa civil No. 3221 sobre interdicto prohibitorio, sobreseyendo la demanda. Los recurrentes apelaron de esta decision, pero en 8 de octubre de 1935, este Tribunal declaro abandonada y sobreseida la apelacion por no haberse pagado los derechos correspondientes. Sobreseida ya definitivamente dicha causa, los recurridos presentaron una mocion pidiendo la ejecucion del auto del Juzgado de fecha 12 de noviembre de 1932 para que se les entregara la posesion de los cuatro lotes arriba mencionados, los cuales continuaban en posesion de los recurrentes por virtud del interdicto prohibitorio. En 13 de diciembre de 1937, previa vista de dicha anterior mocion, con notificacion a ambas partes, el Juzgado dicto su resolucion de la misma fecha declarando ejecutada legalmente la decision de la Corte Suprema en la causa, R.G. No. 30475, mediante la entrega a los recurrentes de las tres parcelas, o sean los lotes 1, 3 y 7, tal como quedan descritos en la diligencia de posesion de 1. ï¿½ de marzo de 1930, y ordeno que los recurrentes entregaran inmediatamente a los recurridos los lotes 2, 4, 6 y 8 descritos en dicha diligencia de posesion. No habiendo los recurrentes cumplido lo ordenado en la anterior resolucion, se presento por los recurridos una mocion acusandoles de desacato; pero el Juzgado, absteniendose por entonces de imponer alguna pena por desacato, ordeno que se expidiera un mandamiento para que por el Sheriff se diera fiel y exacto cumplimiento a lo ordenado en la resolucion de 13 de diciembre de 1937. Ahora bien: los recurrentes contienden que: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"After the judgment of this Honorable Court in civil case No. 2672, G.R. No. 30475, had become final and executed, had the respondent Judge any jurisdiction to issue another order of execution (Exhibit G as well as the above cited orders), more than five (5) years after the execution of said judgment?\" Los recurrentes en su contencion parten del supuesto de que la decision de la Corte Suprema en la causa de reivindicacion habia sido ejecutada legalmente, y por tanto, el Juzgado habia perdido su jurisdiccion para expedir, como en efecto expidio, las ordenes posteriores que en la relacion de hechos hemos citado. El supuesto es totalmente inexacto, porque, si bien es cierto que en 9 de septiembre de 1929 el Sheriff trato de dar cumplimiento a un mandamiento de ejecucion expedido en dicha causa de reivindicacion, resulta sin embargo de los hechos, que el supuesto cumplimiento era nulo y de ningun valor puesto que el Sheriff entrego ilegalmente a los recurrentes, como tres parcelas de terreno, no solamente las que habian sido objeto de la accion de reivindicacion, sino otras cuatro contiguas a las anteriores, que estaban en posesion de los recurridos, y que no habian sido objeto de la causa de reivindicacion. De este modo resulto que se entregaron a los recurrentes siete lotes de terreno, tres de los cuales, o sean, los Nos. 1, 3 y 7 eran los que real y verdaderamente debian serles entregados en virtud del mandamiento de ejecucion expedido en la referida causa de reivindicacion, y los restantes cuatro lotes, o sean, los senalados en el plano con los Nos. 2, 4, 6 y 8 fueron quitados ilegalmente de la posesion de lo,s recurridos. Habiendo sido desposeidos ilegalmente los recurridos de los lotes que ocupaban, no vemos porque razon el Juzgado no tendria jurisdiccion para corregir el error, al ordenar al Sheriff que diese verdadero y fiel cumplimiento al mandamiento de ejecucion en la causa de reivindicacion. Los recurrentes dicen que la resolucin del Juzgado dictada en 13 de diciembre de 1937 ordenando que se haga entrega a los recurridos de los lotes de que habian sido desposeidos, se dicto mas de 5 ahos despues de que la sentencia en la causa de reivindicacion habia sido ejecutada. Esto no es cierto puesto que, como ya hemos visto no hubo mas que una sola verdadera ejecucion de sentencia a favor de los recurrentes, pues la anterior era nula. Por otra parte, la resolucion de 13 de diciembre de 1937 no es mas que la reiteracion de la orden del Juzgado de fecha 12 de noviembre de 1929, la cual habia quedado en suspenso en cuanto a los 4 lotes en cuestion por virtud de la orden de interdicto prohibitorio dictada en la causa de que mas arriba se ha hecho mencion, promovida por los recurrentes contra los recurridos. Los recurrentes no apelaron, ni utilizaron ningun otro recurso especial, contra la citada orden de 12 de noviembre, la cual por tanto quedo firme, y siendo ello asi, no tienen derecho alguno de impugnar ahora la resolucion de 13 de diciembre de 1937, que, como se ha dicho, es una mera reiteracion de dicha orden de 12 de noviembre. Los recurrentes contienden que la alegacion hecha por los recurridos de que las parcelas de terreno entregadas a dichos recurrentes eran en exceso de las que a que tenian derecho, no estaba probada. Este argumento se refuta sencillamente teniendo en consideracion, que los recurrentes compraron de Valeriana Pimentel con pacto de retracto 3 parcelas de terreno con las siguientes respectivas superficies: una de 4 hectareas, otra de 50 areas, y otra de 90 areas, segun la misma escritura de compraventa, otorgada en 25 de abril de 1920 (Exhibit B). Y el titulo de los recurrentes fue confirmado por la Corte Suprema sobre esas 3 parcelas de terreno. Esta es la razon porque en 9 de septiembre de 1929 se ordeno que se entregaran a los recurrentes la posesion de 3 parcelas de terreno, una de 4 hectareas, otra de 50 areas, y otra de 90 areas; pero el Sheriff les dio posesion de 7 lotes descritos como 3 parcelas de mayor extension de lo que realmente debian tener, incluyendo parte de los terrenos de que estaban en posesion de los recurridos. De donde resulta claramente que los recurrentes, debiendo probar que tenian derecho a los 7 lotes de terreno, no han probado sino que solamente tenian derecho a las 3 parcelas con las respectivas superficies arriba mencionadas. Por otro lado, la resolucion de fecha 13 de diciembre de 1937 asi como la orden de 12 de noviembre de 1929, determinan y adjudican los derechos de las partes litigantes y dan fin al incidente a que se refieren. Siendo apelables, no pueden ser objeto de certiorari . (Gobierno de los E.U. contra Juez de Primera Instancia de Pampanga, 49 Jur. Fil., 515; y Gobierno de los E.U. contra Juez de Primera Instancia de Pampanga, 50 Jur. Fil., 1012). Se confirman las ordenes recurridas, denegando la peticion de certiorari presentada en esta causa, con las costas a los recurrentes. Asi se ordena. Avanceña, Pres., Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, y.Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "In the year 1937 the total number of registered voters in the municipality of Talisay, Negros Occidental, was 3,658. In 1938 the electoral census of the place, after the registration on September 24 and October 1, 1938, showed that the number of registered voters had increased to 18,288. A few days before the election for Assemblymen on November 8, 1938, or on October 18, 1938, 17,344 petitions were filed in the justice of the peace court of Bacolod, Negros Occidental, for the exclusion of the names of an equal number of persons from the permanent list of registered voters of Talisay, Negros Occidental, on the grounds that they were not residents of Talisay in accordance with the Election Code, that they could not prepare their ballots themselves, and that their registration as voters was not done in accordance with law. The hearing of the petitions for exclusion was held on October 28, 1938. After attorneys Hilado, Parreño, Remitio and Severino entered their appearance for the challenged voters, the justice of the peace of Bacolod ascertained who of the challenged voters were present in court and who were absent. Thereafter the said justice of the peace declared those who were absent in default. Failing to obtain a reconsideration, the attorneys for the challenged voters moved that, since the presentation of evidence had not yet commenced, all the petitions be forwarded to the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental which was then presided over by two Judges. The attorneys for the petitioners in the said 17,344 exclusion cases objected on the ground that the aforesaid attorneys had no authority to represent those who were absent. Whereupon the justice of the peace of Bacolod ruled that said attorneys could represent only the 87 challenged voters who were present in the court room and accordingly remanded their cases to the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. At the same time the justice of the peace dismissed 253 of the petitions upon motion of the petitioners themselves. Although no evidence was presented by the petitioners in support of their petition against those who were declared in default, the justice of the peace of Bacolod ordered their exclusion from the list of voters on the ground that it was the duty of the challenged voters to appear in court in order to be personally examined in accordance with section 118 (f) of the Election Code, as one of the grounds for their exclusion from the list of voters was that they could not prepare their ballots themselves, that is, that they could not read and write. The attorneys for the challenged voters received notice of the decision of the justice of the peace of Bacolod on November 2, 1938, when the present petition for certiorari was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental by the petitioners in their own behalf and in behalf of the other challenged voters for the purpose of having the judgment of the justice of the peace of Bacolod in the aforesaid exclusion proceedings set aside. After hearing, the Honorable Judge Sotero Rodas of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rendered judgment setting aside the decision of the respondent justice of the peace of Bacolod and ordering the restoration of the excluded voters in the permanent electoral census of Talisay, Negros Occidental. From this judgment the instant appeal was brought, and the respondents-appellants make an elaborate assignment of nine errors. In view of the result hereinbelow reached, we do not consider it necessary to consider seriatim these errors. While the present controversy may seem academic be cause the 1938 election is over, we have nevertheless assumed the task of deciding the same on its merits in view of the imperative necessity and importance of having a correct electoral census in the municipality of Talisay, Negros Occidental, and for that matter in any municipality or city in the Philippines, for use in future elections. In the scheme of our present republican government, the people are allowed to have a voice therein through the instrumentality of suffrage to be availed of by those possessing certain prescribe qualifications (Article V, Constitution of the Philippines; sections 93 and 94, Election Code). The people in clothing a citizen with the elective franchise for the purpose of securing a consistent and perpetual administration of the government they ordain, charge him with the performance of a duty in the nature of a public trust, and in that respect constitute him a representative of the whole people. This duty requires that the privilege thus bestowed should be exercised, not exclusively for the benefit of the citizen or class of citizens professing it, but in good faith and with an intelligent zeal for the general benefit and welfare of the state. (U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S., 588.) In the last analysis, therefore, the inclusion in or exclusion from the permanent electoral list of any voter concerns not only the latter in his individual capacity but the public in general. Section 113 of the Election Code provides that if the Judge of the Court of First Instance is in the province, the proceeding for the inclusion in or exclusion from the list of voters shall, upon petition of any interested party filed before the presentation of evidence, be remanded to the said Judge who shall hear and decide the same in the first and last instance. When, therefore, the attorneys for the challenged voters moved the justice of the peace of Bacolod to remand all the exclusion cases to the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, then presided over by two Judges, it was mandatory on said justice of the peace to grant the motion. Without deciding whether the attorneys who appeared for the challenged voters were in fact authorized by all, it is our opinion that, in view of the extraordinary circumstance that the challenged voters were more than seventeen thousand and a representative number thereof were present, and in view of the nature of the proceedings which affect public interest, it was error for the aforesaid justice of the peace not to have remanded all the petitions for exclusion to the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. Thereafter, in the interest of prompt and economical administration of justice the necessary arrangement could have been made to enable the corresponding judge of First Instance of the province to proceed to Talisay and hear the cases there. The judgment appealed from will accordingly be reversed and in the exercise of our discretionary power (Cason v. Rickards, 5 Phil., 611; Rementeria v. Lara, 6 Phil., 532; Agonoy v. Ruiz, 11 Phil., 204; Muerteguy & Aboitiz v. Delgado, 22 Phil., 109; Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation v. Aldanese, 46 Phil., 713; Tinsay v. Yusay, 47 Phil., 639; Singh v. Tan Chay, 51 Phil., 259; Province of Tayabas v. Perez, 56 Phil., 257), the case is remanded to the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental with instruction to hear and decide the petitions for exclusion on the merits, in the first and last instance (section 113, Electoral Code), giving the parties every opportunity to present their respective evidence, so that it may thereafter make such corrections in the electoral census of Talisay, Negros Occidental, as may be proper (section 90, Electoral Code), and to refer to the Solicitor-General such violations of the Election Law as might have been committed. Without pronouncement as to costs. Avanceña C.J. , Imperial Diaz, Concepcion, and Moran, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandante trata de recobrar en esta accion la propiedad y la posesion del terreno que se describe en la demanda. El Juzgado de Primera Instancia sobreseyo la demanda. Elevada la causa al Tribunal de Apelaciones, este, revocando la decision del Juzgado, decidio que el demandante es dueno del terreno en cuestion y ordeno al demandado a entregar la posesion del mismo. Segun los hechos aceptados por el Tribunal de Apelaciones, el demandado Nemesio Gerio, alla por el ano 1909, que su hizo mayor, el demandante Domingo Gerio, declarara en su nombre el terreno con el objeto de habilitarle a votar para el cargo de presidente municipal en las elecciones de aquel año. El demandado continuo en la posesion de este terreno percibiendo sus frutos y pagando las correspondientes contribuciones. Esta su posesion no fue en modo alguno perturbada hasta el año 1936. El Tribunal de Apelaciones en conclusion declara que el supuesto contrato de transferencia de este terreno hecho por el demandado a favor de su hijo, el demandante (Exhibito I), es ficticio, ejecutado sin consideracion alguna y solamente con el objeto de habilitar al demandante a votar en las elecciones del año 1909. Debe notarse que este terreno fue vendido en publica subasta en virtud de una ejecucion expedida contra el demandante y que este, en debido tiempo, lo recompro. Esto, sin embargo, no tiene valor alguno para apoyar la pretension de dominio del demandante, toda vez que hizo la recompra con dinero facilitado por el demandado, lo cual mas bien confirma la alegacion de este de que nunca habia dejado de ser dueno del terreno. Los errores que señala el recurrente en cuanto a la conclusion del Juzgado declarando ficticia la transferencia del terreno hecha por el demandado a favor del demandante, se refieren solamente al peso de las pruebas, que nosotros no podemos revisar. Por otra parte, habiendo declarado probado el Tribunal de Apelaciones que el demandado ha seguido en posesion del terreno, sin interrupcion, hasta el 1936, carece de apoyo la alegacion del recurrente de que, en todo caso, el derecho del demandado ya ha prescrito. La conducta del demandado al hacer aparecer que ha transferido al demandante la propiedad del terreno no le coloca en estoppel en relacion con el demandante, que no es un tercero en el contrato ficticio que ambos celebraron. Se deniega el recurso y se confirma la sentencia apelada, con costas al recurrente. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Se trata de una accion por detentacion ilegal de terreno. El Tribunal de Apelaciones confirmo la sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Isabela que ordena la devolucion de la posesion del terreno objeto del litigio al demandante y condena a la demandada al pago de daños y perjuicios, aunque reduciendo la cuantia de estos. La demandada recurre contra esta sentencia del Tribunal de Apelaciones y alega que este erro al condenar a la demandada al pago de daños y perjuicios, no habiendo alegacion alguna sobre los mismos en el cuerpo de la demanda y si solo en la parte petitoria. Esta alegacion en la petitoria es bastante (art. 81 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil — formulario). Se elega tambien que el Tribunal de Apelaciones erro al condenar a la demandada al pago de las costas, no obstante de que modifica la sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia en cuanto a la cuantia de los daños. Pero el pago de las costas es cuestion que deja la ley a la discrecion del Tribunal (art. 487 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil y Regla 131, sec. 1, de los Reglamentos vigentes). Por estas consideraciones, se deniega el recurso y se confirma la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El lote 862 a que se refiere esta causa, con certificado original de titulo No. 5446, pertenece proindiviso a Inocencio Ligon en una mitad, y a Ester Ligon y Loreto Ligon, en partes iguales, en la otra mitad. En la causa civil No. 28581 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila, entablada por Sabina Geraldo y Carlos Davis contra Inocencio Ligon, Para cobrar de este la cantidad de P2,780, se dicto sentencia en favor de la demanda. Para la ejecucion de esta sentencia, el sheriff de la Ciudad de Manila vendio la participacion de Inocencio Ligon en este lote 862. Siendo Mamerto G. Ligon el mejor postor en la subasta, le fue adjudicado todo derecho, interes y participacion que pudiera tener el demandado Inocencio Ligon sobre este lote. Pero, expirado el plazo legal de retracto, sin que hiciera uso de el, el sheriff expidio el documento definitivo de esta venta por todo el terreno representado en el lote 862 descrito en su titulo original No. 5446. Mamerto Ligon solicito y obtuvo posteriormente que se cancelara el titulo original No. 5446 y se expidiera en su lugar otro certificado de transferencia a su favor como dueño de todo el lote. Mamerto Ligon, ultimamente, vendio todo este lote 862 a Juliana Pengson quien, exhibiendo ante el Registrador de Titulos de Propiedad de Nueva Ecija la escritura de venta, pidio la expedicion de otro certificado de transferencia de titulo a su nombre. El Registrador de Titulos, habiendo examinado los antecedentes del terreno y habiendo descubierto que no habia sido vendido a Inocencio Ligon todo el lote 862, sino solamente una mitad del mismo, y considerando, por esta razon, que Mamerto Ligon no era dueño de todo el lote comprado por el y no tenia derecho a venderlo, en su integridad, a Juliana Pengson, elevo el asunto ante la Cuarta Sala del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila en consulta. El Juez de la Cuarta Sala, resolviendo esta consulta, declaro que el Registrador de Titulos de Propiedad de Manila solamente puede registrar una mitad del lote a nombre de Juliana Pengson. De esta resolucion se presento apelacion. Resulta, segun lo expuesto, que, en su ultimo resultado, si el Registrador admite el registro de todo el lote 862 a nombre de Juliana Pengson, quedarian ilegalmente despojados Ester y Loreto Ligon de la mitad de este lote que las corresponde. Salta a la vista que el Registrador no puede cooperar a consumar esta injusticia. Se dice que su deber es ministerial. Aunque se admite que asi es, no es, sin embargo, hasta la extension de obligarle a sancionar conscientemente semejante injusticia. Debe tenerse en cuenta que, por lo que resulta de los hechos expuestos, Mamerto Ligon, al comprar la finca como de la propiedad de Inocencio Ligon, sabia, porque la informacion de los antecedentes del terreno estaba a su alcance, que Inocencio Ligon no era dueño de todo el lote. No creemos aplicable la decision que cita el recurrente en la causa de la Cruz contra Fabie (36 Jur. Fil., 146), pues, aquella decision se dicto en consideracion a la negligencia del dueño, circunstancia que no ocurre en el caso presente. Ademas, en aquella causa se trataba de anular y cancelar un titulo de transferencia ya expedido, que no es el caso presente, en que solo se trata de registrar y de expedirse un certificado de transferencia, que aun no se ha hecho. Por estas consideraciones, se confirma la resolucion apelada, con las costas a la apelante. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Los hermanos Manuel Oria y Antonio Oria, propietarios del lote 1881 de la medicion catastral de Sibulan, Negros Oriental, lo vendieron con pacto de retro a Vicente Colina y Ambrosio Osmeña, continuando, sin embargo, los Oria en su posesion. En este expediente catastral, el lote fue adjudicado a los hermanos Oria, sujeto a la venta con pacto de retro a favor de Colina y Osmena. No habiendose ejercitado el derecho de retracto que tenian los hermanos Oria, Colina y Osmeña pidieron la expedicion del titulo a su nombre y asi se ordeno. Habiendo mas tarde adquirido Colina la participacion de Osmeña en el lote, se expidio otro titulo exclusivamente a su nombre. Conjuntamente con estos procedimientos, se promovio por los hermanos Oria otra accion independiente sobre la nulidad del titulo expedido a favor de Colina y Osmeña. Colina, invocando el valor de su titulo sobre el lote en cuestion, pidio un mandamiento de posesion, que el Juzgado denego. La cuestion que se suscita ahora en esta apelacion es simplemente la de si procede, por parte del Juzgado, expedir mandamiento de posesion en un expediente de registro. El articulo 17 de la Ley No. 496 autoriza al tribunal en los expedientes de registro expedir mandamiento de ejecucion de sus decisiones. Esta Ley fue despues enmendada por la No. 1108 y por la No. 1680 en cuanto a detalles, pero manteniendo expresamente la autoridad del tribunal a expedir mandamiento de ejecucion de sus sentencias. Mas, vino el Codigo Administrativo en el ano 1917, derogando el articulo 17 de la Ley No. 496. Se sostiene que, en virtud de esta derogacion, el tribunal, en un expediente de registro, carece ya de autoridad para expedir mandamientos de ejecucion de sus sentencias. Las Leyes Nos. 1108 y 1680 no han sido, sin embargo, derogadas. Hemos declarado en la causa de Marciano Romasanta y otros contra El Juez de Primera Instancia, Honorable Servillano Platon, que la enmienda a un articulo de una ley o a la misma ley no queda necesariamente derogada con la derogacion del articulo de la ley o de la ley que habia sido objeto de enmienda. No estando derogada la Ley No. 1680, hemos declarado en aquella decision que la autoridad del tribunal, en un asunto de registro, para expedir mandamiento de ejecucion de su sentencia, subsiste, no obstante la vigencia del Codigo Administrativo. Por lo demas, la pendencia de otra causa civil, promovida para anular el titulo del apelante, no puede impedir el efecto de la expedicion de este titulo, mientras no se dicte en ella una decision final que la anule. Por tanto, con revocacion de la sentencia apelada, se ordena la devolucion de esta causa al Juzgado de origen para que proceda de acuerdo con esta decision, con las costas a los apelados. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

Habiendo el demandante dejado de pagar dos de estos plazos en la cantidad de P2,000, el demandado solicito del Juzgado que se venda el terreno en la parte necesaria para el pago de estos plazos vencidos. El Juzgado proveyo favorablemente a est;a peticion y de esta resolucion apelo el demandante. Lo unico que el demandante alega en su apelacion es que el Juzgado no podia haber ordenado la venta del terreno, no habiendo sido dado el mismo en hipoteca para el cobro de la cantidad debida. Pero el caso es que no se orden6 la venta del terreno porque esta hipotecado, sino en virtud de la sentencia firme dictada por el Juzgado de acuerdo con el convenido de las partes.

Elevada la causa ante el Juzgado de Primera Instancia, fue sobteseida por considerarse que el Juzagado de Paz no tenia jurisdiccion sobre la causa, y que, por tal razon., el Juzgado de Primera Instanccia carece a su vez de juridiccion apelada sobre la misma.

El Juzgado de Primera Instancia, al sobreseer la causa y al declarar que el Juzgado de Paz carecia de jurisdiccion originaria para conocer de ella, se fundo en que el demandado poseia el terreno objeto de la accion dentro del año anterior a la interposicion de la demanda. El Juzgado acepto como probados los siguientes hechos: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"La preponderancia de las pruebas, sin embargo, es al efecto de que el terreno en cuestion es parte de otro terreno de mayor extension de la propiedad de Francisco Padrigon, quien estuvo en posesion del mismo desde en tiempo de España.

Los herederos de Francisco Padrigon, para rescatarlo de Esteban Razon y pagar las morosidades en el pago de la contibucion territorial, otorgaron una escritura de anticrecis firmada por Juana Padrigon (Exhibitos 1 y 1-A) a favor de Manuel Revalo. \"En el año 1927, los mencionados herederos, uno de los cuales es el padre del demandado, rescataron del Manuel Revalo el terreno en cuestion, poseyendolo el padre del demandado desde entoces hasta el año 1932 en que le sucedio el demandado mismo, habiendolo este poseido hasta la fecha. Desde el año 1912 el terreno en cuestion fue amillarado a nombre de Juana Padrigon (Exhibitos 2 y 3), contribuyendo en partes igueles al pago de la contribuccion territorial correpondiente sus hermanos, siendo uno de ellos el padre del demandado. Este amillaramiento a nombre de Juana Padrigon fue mas bien como administradora de sus hermanos. La cancelacion de dicho amiillaramiento y la sustitucion del mismo por otro a nombre de Cipriano Gamboa se verifico sin consentimiento ni conocimiento de los coposeedores de Juana Padrigon.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Supuetos estos hechos, que hallamos suficientemente apoyados por las pruebas, aparece claro que el demandado era el que estaba en posesion del terreno dentro del año anterior a la interposicion de la demanda, y, por esta rezon, aunque el demandante puede tener derecho de accion en otros conceptos, no lo tiene para la accion por detentacion. Se afirma que el Juzagado erro al tener en cuneta el documento Exhibito 1-A, que en si no es prueba legal y que, por otro parte, no ha sido admitido por el Juzgado como prueba. Pero, aparece en la decision apelada que el Juzgado no se fundo precisa y solamente en este documento, al dictar su decision, sino en otros pruebas que, como hemos dicho, apoyan suficientemente su conlusion. Se confirma la sentencia apelada, con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El 9 de mayo de 1912, Alejandra F. Callao, madre del demandado Juan F. Villarroel, obtuvo de los esposos Mariano Estrada y Severina un prestamo de P1,000 pagadero al cabo de siete anos (Exhibito A). Alejandra fallecio, dejando como unico heredero al demandado. Los esposos Mariano Estrada y Severina fallecieron tambien, dejando como unico heredero al demandante Bernardino Estrada. El 9 de agosto de 1930, el demandado suscribio un documento (Exhibito B) por el cual declara en deber al demandante la cantidad de P1,000, con un interes de 12 por ciento al año. Esta accion versa sobre el cobro de esta cantidad. El Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Laguna, en el cual se interpuso esta accion, condeno al demandado a pagar al demandante la cantidad reclamada de P1,000 con sus intereses legales de 12 por ciento al aiio desde el 9 de agosto de 1930 hasta su completo pago. Se apelo de esta sentencia. Se notara que las partes en la presente causa son, respectivamente, los unicos herederos de los acreedores y de la deudora originales. Esta accion se ejercita en virtud de la obligacion que el demandado, como unico hijo de la primitiva deudora, contrajo en favor del demandante, unico heredero de los primitivos acreedores. Se admite que la cantidad de P1,000 a que se contrae esta obligacion es la misma deuda de la madre del demandado a los padres del demandante. Aunque la accion para recobrar la deuda original ha prescrito ya cuando se interpuso la demanda en esta causu, la cuestion que se suscita en esta apelacion es principalmente la de si, no obstante tal prescripcion, es procedelltc la accion entablada. Sin embargo, no se funda la presente accion en la obligacion original contraida por la madl e del demandado, que ya ha prescrito, sino en la que contrajo el demandado el 9 de agosto de 1930 (Exhibito B) al asumir el cumplimiento de aquella obligacion, ya prescrita. Siendo el demandado el unico heredero de la primitiva deudora, con derecho a sucederla en su herencia, aquella deuda contraida por su madre legalmente, aunque perdio su eficacia por prescripcion, ahora es, sin embargo, para el una obligacion moral, que es consideracion suficiente a crear y hacer eficaz y exigible su obligacion voluntariamente contraida el 9 de agosto de 1930 en el Exhibito B. La regla de que una promesa nueva de pagar una deuda prescrita debe ser hecha por la misma persona obligada o por otra legalmente autorizada por ella, no es aplicable al caso presente en que no se exige el cumplimiento de la obligacion de la obligada originalmente, sino del que despues quiso voluntariamente asumir esta obligacion. Se confirma la sentencia apelada, con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

Fue condenado a cinco dias de arresto menor y a pagar las costas. Apelo de esta sentencia. En el Juzgado de Primera Instancia, el fiscal provincial presento otra querella por los mismos hechos, alegando, sin embargo, que las lesiones causadas al ofendido requirieron asistencia medica y produjeron incapacidad para el trabajo por un periodo de veinte dias. Despues de practicadas las pruebas, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia condeno al apelante por el delito acusado en la querella del fiscal a un mes y un dia de arresto mayor y a indemnizar al of endido en la cantidad de P33 con prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia. La unica cuestion que se suscita ahora en esta instancia es la de si el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Rizal tenia jurisdiccion para condenar al apelante por el delito acusado en la querella del fiscal provincial. Como se ve, el apelante fue acusado y condenado en el Juzgado de Paz por el delito de lesiones leves, que tardaron en curarse y produjeron incapacidad no mas tarde de cinco dias, del cual tenia jurisdiccion originaria dicho Juzgado. La acusacion en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia es por estas mismas lesiones en cuanto requirieron asistencia medica y produjeron incapacidad para el trabajo por un periodo de veinte dias, del cual no tiene jurisdiccion el Juzgado de Paz. La jurisdiccion conferida al Juzgado de Primera Instancia en virtud de la apelacion del apelante esta limitada al delito objeto de la sentencia, de que se ha apelado. No la tiene para condenar, en apelacion, por un delito del que no tiene jurisdiccion el tribunal de cuya sentencia se apelo. El delito acusado en el Juzgado de Paz esta castigado en el articulo 266, parrafo 1 del Codigo Penal Revisado. Por tanto, de acuerdo con la recomendaci6n del Procurador General, con modificacion de la sentencia apelada, se condena al apelante a veinte (20) dias de arresto menor y a indemnizar al ofendido en la cantidad de P33, con la prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia, con las costas. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandado Ambrosio Sapungan, en el documento Exhibito A que suscribio el 30 de julio de 1924, reconoce estar obligado a pagar a las demandantes la cantidad de P1,519.49 en tres plazos, con sus intereses legales (Exhibito A). Cuando el 21 de mayo de 1930 las demandantes interpusieron una demanda contra el demandado para el cobro de esta cantidad, entraron en un convenio (Exhibito B), en el cual el demandado reconocio otra vez en deber a las demandantes la cantidad de P1,519.49, que es el valor de las legitimas de estas sobre un terreno dejado por la finada Severina Ruedas de Pablo y que compro el demandado. Se hace constar en este convenio que el demandado no pagaba actualmente esta cantidad por haber aun un pleito entre el y el Padre Pajarillo sobre este terreno. Por virtud de este convenio, las partes en aquella causa pidieron su sobreseimiento y el Juzgado asi acordo. Debe mencionarse, ademas, que en otra causa sobre la reclamacion del Padre Pajarillo sobre el mismo terreno, en que intervinieron las demandantes y el demandado, se entro en otro convenio por el cual, entre otras cosas, el demandado se comprometio a solicitar dentro del termino de seis meses su registro. Por no haber pagado el demandado la cantidad de P1,519.49 y por no haber solicitado el registro del terreno despues de seis meses, las demandantes interpusieron la presente accion para cobrar la mencionada cantidad. El Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Tayabas dicto decision condenando al demandado Ambrosio Sapungan a pagar a las demandantes la cantidad de P1,519.49, con sus intereses legales a partir del 30 de julio de 1924 hasta su completo pago. Siendo esta cantidad, por otra parte, el precio de la venta de un terreno sobre el cual hay pendiente un litigio con un tercero, de acuerdo con el articulo 1502 del Codigo Civil, el Juzgado ordeno que las demandantes presten una fianza por la cantidad de P1,520 para garantizar al demandado la devoluci6n del precio en caso de ser vencido en el litigio. De esta decision el demandado apelo en cuanto se le condena a pagar los intereses de la cantidad reclamada y en cuanto se obliga a las demandantes a prestar solamente una fianza por la cantidad de P1,520. Pretende el demandado que, aunque originalmente, en virtud del documento Exhibito A, el se obligo a pagar intereses legales por la cantidad reclamada, aquel contrato, sin embargo, fue novado por el convenio Exhibito B que celebro con las demandantes en la causa civil No. 2781, en el cual no se menciona que se habia obligado a pagar intereses por la cantidad reclamada. Pero es que en el convenio Exhibito B, la cantidad que el demandado reconocia en deber a las demandantes es la misma que se obligo a pagar, en virtud del Exhibito A, con sus intereses legales. El Exhibito B no es ulIa novacion del Exhibito A. Es simplemente una reiteracion, por parte del demandado, del reconocimiento de su deuda a las demandantes. En este sentido el Exhibito B no altera el Exhibito A con respecto los intereses. En cuanto a que el Juzgado solo exigio de las demandantes la cantidad de P1,520 como fianza para la devolucion al demandado del precio del terreno en el caso de que este fuera vencido en el juicio, siendo esta cantidad equivalente al precio que las demandantes estarian obligadas a devolver al demandado, y que es lo unico que requiere el articulo 1502 del Codigo Civil, el Juzgado no ha incurrido en error al fijar en la expresada cantidad la fianza que deben prestar las demandantes. Se confirma la sentencia apelada, con las costas a los apelantes. Asi se ordena. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

Despues de multiples incidentes que surgieron, sobre todo en relacion con la parte demandada, a la cual fueron agregandose sucesivamente varios otros nombres de personas como otras demandadas, el Juzgado levanto este deposito mediante fianza de P10,000 que deben prestar los demandados. Se presenta esta solicitud de certiorari contra los actuales demandados y el Juez de Primera Instancia que dicto la orden levantando el deposito, y se alega que este obro fuera de su jurisdiccion al dictar aquella orden. La ley deja a la mas amplia discrecion de los tribunales la cuestion del deposito de bienes objeto de litigio. La accion, por tanto, del Juez recurrido en este caso esta dentro de su jurisdiccion. Teniendo en cuenta, por otra parte, que el deposito fue ordenado sin previa fianza, y en cambio su levantamiento se ha ordenado mediante fianza que garantice el resarcimiento de cualesquier danos que el demandante puede sufrir, es patente que el Juzgado no solo obro dentro de su jurisdiccion sino que no abuso de su discreciop. Por lo demas, la suficiencia de la fianza prestada o que se preste no afecta a la jurisdiccion del Juzgado ante quien puede suscitarse esta cuestion en cualquier tiempo mientras dure el deposito.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Camila de Liza promovio en el Juzgado Municipal de Manila contra Purificacion Pascua una accion por detentacion ilegal de una casa. La decision dictada en aquella causa, ademas de otros pronunciamientos, condena a la demandada a desalojar la casa. En el mismo dia de haberse dictado esta decision, el Juez ordeno su ejecucion. La demandada presenta ahora ante este Tribunal Suppremo este recurso de certiorari para que el honorable Juez Mariano Nable del Juzgado Municipal de Manila fuese ordenado a no poner en vigor el mandamiento de ejecucion de su sentencia, alegando que obro fuera y con exceso de su jurisdiccion al dictarla. La cuestion que se suscita en este recurso se reduce a la de si, despues de dictada sentencia en una causa por detentacion de terreno, puede ordenarse la ejecucion de esta sentencia inmediatamente. La seccion 18 de la Regla 4 de los Reglamentos de los Tribunales de Justicia provee que, despues de dictada una sentencia final por un tribunal inferior, se ordenara su ejecucion despues del tiempo senalado para apelar, cuando no se haya presentado apelacion. Esta es una regla general. Pero, el mismo reglamento, al ocuparse de los proedimientos por detentacion ilegal de terreno, provee en su Regla 72, seccion 8, que, si la sentencia dictada es contra el demandado, se ordenara su ejecucion inmediatamente, a menos que se haya perfeccionado una apelacion y el demandado haya prestado una fianza, aprobada por el Juez de Paz o Municipal, para suspender la ejecucion de la sentencia. Indudablemente esta seccion 8 de la Regla 72 es una excepcion de la Regla General, requerida por el caracter sumario del procedimiento. Si en esta clase de accion no pudiera ejecutarse la sentencia sino despues del tiempo señalado para apelacion, y no inmediatamente, careceria de todo objeto esta provision de la Regla 72, seccion 8, pe, lo que indica que, en otro caso, o sea, cuando es contra el demandante, no es aplicable y el procedimiento es diferente. Sin embargo, no seria diferente si en ambos casos la sentencia no pudiera ejecutarse sino despues de transcurrido el plazo para apelar, segun la Regla 4.a, y, en este respecto esta Regla seria tambien completamente inutil. Por estas consideracioues, no seria sino una reiteracion innecesaria de la Regla 4.a seccion 8.a. La palabra \"inmediatamente\" usada en esta regla, en su significacion literal, entrana un sentido contrario y expresa una excepcion a la Regla 4, seccion 18. Notese, ademas, que esta ejecucion inmediata que se ordena en esta Regla 72 solamente rige cuando la sentencia dictada es en favor del demandantnes, declaramos legal la orden de ejecucion expedida por el Honorable Juez Mariano Nable y denegamos el recurso, con las costas a la recurrente.

Al. contra La Comision de Servicios Publicos y V. Fragrante, como Director de Obras Publicas, R. G. No. 47145). Por otra parte, la Comision de Servicios Publicos, al negar a expedir certificado de conveniencia en favor del recurrente, por ser un extranjero, obra legalmente de acuerdo con la seccion 8, Articulo XIII de la Constitucion de Filipinas y la seccion 16 (a) de la Ley No. 146 del Commonwealth.

Apelada la sentencia al Tribunal de Apelaciones, este la confirmo con la sola modificacion de que la pena impuesta se denomine prision, en vez de arresto, y se reduce a P800 la indemnizacion por gastos de hospital y de asistencia medica. El demandante apelo otra vez de esta sentencia ante este Tribunal. Segun las conclusiones de hecho establecidas por el Tribunal de Apelaciones, el 20 de septiembre de 1936, viniendo su Excelencia, el Presidente del Commonwealth de h Ciudad de Tagaytay para Manila, le escoltaban tres policias montados, dos de los cuales eran Lozada y el ofendido Johnson, que iban delante del coche del Presidente. Al llegar a Manila frente a la calle de Vermont, trasversal a la Avenida Taft, Lozada, habiendo notado que el automovil del Presidente se habia parado, se paro tambien, mientras Johnson, que no lo adviertio, siguio su camino. Despues Johnson, que oyo la bocina del motorciclo de Lozada, volvio la cara y noto que este le daba la senal para que volviera. Johnson, mirando antes hacia atras, por si venia algun coche, y, dando la senal, dio la vuelta con su motorciclo. El apelante, que tambien venia detras, choco contra el motorciclo de Johnson, quien cayo al suelo. El coche del acusado iba corriendo con tanta velocidad que no le fue posible evitar que chocara contra el motorciclo de Johnson. Con estos hechos el Tribunal de Apelaciones concluye que el apelante obro con imprudencia temeraria. Segun estos hechos, la sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia, asi como la dictada por el Tribunal de Apelaciones, condenando al apelante por el delito de lesiones graves cometido por imprudencia temeraria, es correcta. El recurrente en esta instancia se limita a impugnar la suficiencia de las pruebas para establecer estos hechos. No podemos revisar las conclusiones de hecho del Tribunal de Apelaciones.

La Ley No. 454, enmendando la No. 146, definiendo en su articulo 13, la expresion \"servicio publico,\" incluye en ella a \"toda persona que poseyere, explotare, administrare o dirigiere en Filipinas para fines de alquiler o pago con parroquia general o limitada, ya sea permanente, ocasional o accidental, y para fines de lucro, algun medio de transporte. . . vehiculo de motor, ya sea de carga o pasaje, con o sin ruta fija.\" El servicio de los trucks del recurrente dedicados a transportacion mediante compensacion, esta comprendido claramente en la expresion de \"servicio publico,\" como se define en esta ley. Requiriendo, por otra parte, la ley la provision previa de certificado de conveniencia publica por la Comision de Servicios Publicos para que la Oficina de Obras Publicas pueda expedir al recurrente la licencia que solicita para el ailo 1940, la Oficina de Obras Publicas no puede ser compelida a expedir esta licencia sin la presentacion previa del certificado de conveniencia publica. Por lo demas, siendo la licencia que expide la Oficina de Obras Publicas limitada al ano corriente, y debiendo renovarse cada ailo sucesivo, el recurrente no puede alegar que la accion de la Oficina de Obras Publicas, al negarse a expedir la licencia correspondiente al ano 1940, afecta a sus derechos adquiridos, puesto que el derecho a operar sus trucks en virtud de la licencia expedida por la Oficina de Obras Publicas no se extiende a los anos no cubiertos por la licencia anterior (Junzo Ohkawa contra Comision de Servicios Publicos, Trib. Sup. R. G. No. 47145). Aunque esta incluida en el recurso la Comision de Servicios Publicos, como recurrida, no hay, sin embargo ninguna alegacion que justifique el recurso. No se alega que ha ejecutado algun acto oficial fuera o en exceso de su jurisdiccion. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Entre el 4 y el 10 de Octubre de 1933, Felipe España, Moisee Ubaña, Filomeno Agris y Ceferino Aguirre localizaron una mina denominada \"Maximo\" en el sitio de Bilaobilao, barrio de Santa Rosa, municipio de Mambulao, Camarines Norte, colocando los correspondientes postes para su identificacion. El 10 de noviembre del mismo año Ceferino Aguirre fue a la oficina del registrador de minas en Daet para registrar la declaracion de localizacion de esta mina, pero, el registrador Baldomero Lapak estaba ausente y tuvo que esperarle hastas las cuatro de la tarde en que Ilego. Baldomero Lapak, al ilegar, dijo a Aguirre que, siendo ya hora de salir de la oficina, volviera el dia sivio a la oficina del registrador y entrego la declaracion de localizacion de la mina, habiendosele expedido el recibo extra-oficial de esta declaracion y de la cantidad de P4 que pago por los derechos de registro. Esto es bastante para considerar hecho el registro el 10 noviembre, como ha declarado el Tribunal de Apelaciones. El 24 de Enero de 1934, el registrador escribio a Aguirre una carta notificandole que el registro de su declaracion fue denegado por haberse presentado fuera de tiempo. Habiendo, sin embargo, apelado Aguirre de esta resolucion del Registrador de Minas de Camarines Norte al jefe de la division de recursos minerales del Departamento de Agricultura y Comercio, se ordeno el registro de esta declaracion con fecha 11 de Noviembre de 1933. Resulta, por otra parte, que el dia 14 de Noviembre de 1933, se registro en el registro de minas de Camarines Norte otra declaracion de locacion de la misma mina \"Maximo, denominada \"Masaya\", por Peter Johnson. No hay discusion sobre que ambas \"Maximo\" y \"Masaya\" registradas respectivamente por Aguirre y por Peter Johnson, se refieran a la misma mina. Suscitada en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Camarines Norte por Moisee Ubaña, que adquirio los derechos a la mina \"Maximo\", y por Peter Johnson, que registro la misma mina como \"Masaya\", la preferencia entre ambos registros, el Juzgado declaro preferente el de la mina \"Maximo.\" Apelada la causa ante el Tribunal de Apelaciones, este confirmo la decision del de Primera Instancia, y de esta decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones se apela ahora ante esta Corte Suprema. El Tribunal de Apilaciones declaro que la localizacion fue registrada dentro de treinta dias. Esta conclusion, sin embargo, es erronea en vista de los hechos que el mismo Tribunal acepta en su decision, segun la cual la localizacion fue terminada el 10 de octubre de 1933 y su registro se hizo el 10 de noviembre del mismo año. El tiempo transcurrido desde el 11 de octubre de 1933 inclusive hasta el 10 de noviembre del mismo año tambien inclusive es de 31 dias, y por tanto, el registro hecho el 10 de noviembre se ha hecho a los treintaun dias y despues de los treinta que fija la ley. Se pretende que, habiendose hecho el registro un dia despues del plazo marcado por la ley, el mismo es invalido. La ley del Congreso de 1. ï¿½ de julio de 1902, como esta emmendada por otra de 5 de febrero de 1905, fija el plazo de 30 dias para el registrado de la declaracion de localizacion de una mina y dispone que, si no se registra dentro de este tiempo se considerara abandonada. El objeto de fijar este plazo es para que la mina quede libre para su localizacion por otro. Pero, cuando al hacerse el registro, aunque un dia despues, dilacion perfectamente excusable, no habia otro derecho adverso que pudiera ser afectado, como en este caso, no debe ser la intencion de lay declarar invalido dicho registro. Por lo demas, no podemos alterar la conclusion que sienta el Tribunal de Apelaciones de que la localizacion de la mina por parte del recurrido es completa y se ha hecho con todos los requisitos de la ley. Por estas consideraciones, se deniega el recurso y se confirma la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones, con las costas al recurrente. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, y Horrilleno, MM. estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Segun la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones, los hermanos Loreto Dingcong y Jose Dingcong son soarrendatarios de los altos de la casa de Emilia Saenz situada en la Calle Jose Ma. Basa de la Ciudad de Iloilo, donde establecieron el Central Hotel, siendo la primera la dueña y el ultimo su manager. El demandado Francisco Echevarria ocupo, mediante pago de P30 al mes, el cuatro No. 10 de dicho hotel. Los demandantes ocupaban, a su vez los bajos de este hotel donde tenian establecido su \"American Bazar\" dedicado a la compra y venta de articulos y mercancias. Hacia las once de la noche del 19 de septiembre de 1933, Echevarria, al retirarse a la cama, dejo abierto descuidadamente el grifo que daba sobre una palangana ordinaria sin desague. Como las tuberias del hotel en aquel tiempo estaban en reparacion, cuando a la media noche el agua descorrio por las tuberias, se esparcio por el suelo, traspasandolo y mojando los articulos y mercancias almacenadas en los bajos en el establecimiento \"American Bazar\", causando una perdida, que el Juzgado de Primera Instancia estimo en P1,089.61. Se presento esta accion por Halim Kanaan, Nasri Kanaan y Michel Kanaan en nombre del \"American Bazar\" contra Loreta Dingcong, Jose Dingcong y Francisco Echeverria por daños y perjuicios causados a los demandantes. El Juzgado sobreseyo la causa en cuanto a Loreto Dingcong por haber fallecido, y condeno a Francisco Echevarria, absolviendo a Jose Dingcong. Los demandantes apelaron de esta decision en cuanto absuelve a Jose Dingcong. El Tribunal Apelaciones, revocando la decision del Juzgado de Primera Instancia, declaro a Jose Dingcong responsable y le condeno a pagar a los demandantes el importe de los daños y perjuicios causados a los mismos como fue estimado por el Juzgado. Se presenta ahora ante esta Corte, mediante certiorari , apelacion de esta decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Siendo Jose Dingcong coarrendatario y manager del hotel, con completa posesion de los altos de la casa, debe responder por los daños causados por las cosas que se arrojaron o cayeron de la misma (articulo 1910 del Codigo Civil). Francisco Echevarria era huesped del hotel y fue el que directamente, por su descuido, al dejar abierto el grifo, permitio, que el agua de la tuberia descorriera por el suelo y se filtrara hacia los bajos, mojando los articulos y mercancias de los demandantes. Jose Dingcong, por otra parte, no practico la diligencia de un buen padre de familia para prevenir estos daños, no obstante de que sabia que podian causarse por estar entonces en reparacion las tuberias, pues, debiendo presumir que Echavarria podia usar el grifo no le proveyo de algun recipiente con desagï¿½e, y si solo puso debajo del mismo una palangana que, al Ilenarse, hizo que el agua se esparciera por el suelo.

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Esta es una apelacion mediante certiorari de la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Se trata de la reclamacion presentada por el Banco de las Islas Filipinas, que representa a la insolvencia de \"DIZON & CO., INC.,\" para cobrar de Salud Baluyut, como administradora judicial del difunto Salustiano Guiao Suarez, la cantidad de P4,225, importe no pagado de suscricion a la corporacion Dizon & Co., Inc. El Tribunal de Apelaciones, revocando la decision del Juzgado de Primera Instancia, condeno a la demandada a pagar al Banco demandante esta cantidad reclamada. La cuestion que se suscita en esta instancia se reduce a si Salustiano Guiao Suarez se suscribio a las acciones de Dizon & Co., Inc., o, si las compro de esta corporacion. El documento que Salustiano Guaio Suarez firmo en relacion con estas acciones expresa literalmente una suscricion, no una compra de acciones. Es tan claro el documento en este sentido y son tan inequivocos sus terminos que no cabe interpretarlos, pues, expresan claramente la intencion de la transaccion. En nuestra opinion el documento firmado por Salustiano Guiao Suarez es de suscricion, como ha declarado el Tribunal de Apelaciones, y no de venta. La Apelacion se funda en que habiendo incurrido en inzolvencia la corporacion Dizon & Co., Inc., esta carece de derecho y no puede exigir el pago del resto del importe de estas acciones. No se discute que, si se trata de suscricion de acciones, la insolvencia de la corporacion impide que esta pueda cobrar el resto no pagado de su importe. Siendo nuestra conclusion la de que qe trata de una suscricion y no de venta, debemos confirmar la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones. Y siendo esta nuestra conclusion, no necesitamos considerar la discusion que la apelante hace de que la insolvencia de la corporacion impide a esta exigir el pago del resto del importe de las acciones en el supuesto de que se trata de venta de las mismas, toda vez que este no es el caso. Se dice, academas, que esta suscricion, aun suponiendo que lo sea, debe declararse nula por las irregularidades en que ha incurrido la corporacion, infringiendo la ley de corporaciones y la ley No. 2581, conocida por Blue Sky Law. No hallamos peso en este fundamento. Se dice que la corporacion infringio la ley de corporaciones (Ley No. 1459, como esta reformada por la 3518) por haber expedido certificados de acciones por pagos parciales. Esto no es exacto, pues, la mismo recurrente admite en su alegato que los certificados de 31 acciones que le expidio la corporacion corresponden al pago de P1,550 que hizo y que cubre completamenta su importe al valor par de P50 por accion. En cuanto a la infraccion de la Blue Sky Law resulta que los hechos que, segï¿½n se alega, constituyen esta infraccion occurrieron despues ya de haberse hecho la suscricion, la cual no puede quedarse afectada por estos hechos posteriores. Se confirma la sentencia del Tribunal de Apelaciones, con las costas a la recurrente. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "HORRILLENO, M. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Este asunto se ha elevado a esta Superioridad por el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Baguio, ya que solo suscita una cuestion puramente de derecho. El 20 de marzo de 1939 el demandante inicio la presente causa, en la que no comparecio la demandada, no obstante haber sido debidamente emplazada. Por lo que, permitido el demandante a presentar sus pruebas, el Juzgado inferior fallo el asunto a favor de la demandada. De ahi esta apelacion. El demandante pide la anulacion de su matrimonio habido con la demandada Luida Mangonon de Buccat el 26 de noviembre de 1938, en la Ciudad de Baguio, fundandose en que, al consentir en dicho matrimonio, lo hizo porque la demandada le habia asegurado que ella era virgen. De la decision del Juzgado inferior se desprenden los siguientes hechos: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandante conocio a la demandada el mes de marzo de 1938. Despues de varias entravistas, ambos quedaron comprometidos el 19 de septiembre del mosmo año. El 26 de noviembre de igual año, el demandante contrajo matrimonio con la demandada en la catedral catolica de la Ciudad de Baguio. Despues de convivir maritalmente por espacio de ochenta y nueve dias, la demandada dio a luz un niño de nueve dias, la demandada dio a luz un niño de nueve meses, el 23 de febrero de 1939. De resultas de este acontecimiento, el demandante abandono a la demandada y no volvio a hacer vida marital con ella. No vemos razon alguna para revocar la sentencia apelada. En efecto, es inverosimil la alegacion del demandante y apelante que el ni siquiera habia sospechado el estado gravido de la demandada, estando esta, como queda probado, en condicion preñada muy avanzada. Por lo que no ha lugar a estimar el fraude de que habla el apelante. Lo alegado por este en el sentido de que no es raro hallar a personas de abdomen desarollado, nos parece pueril para merecer nuestra consideracion, tanto maa cuanto que el demandante era estudiante de primer año de derecho. El matrimonio es una institucion sacratisima: es el cimiento en que descansa la sociedad. Para anularlo, son menester pruebas claras y fehacientes. En este asunto no existen tales pruebas. Hallando la sentencia apelada ajustada a derecho, debe ser confirmada, como por la presente las confirmamos, en todas sus partes, con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Avanceña, Pres. Imperial, Diaz, y Laurel, MM., estan conformes.\n",

Se trata de la devolucion del recargo de impuesto sobre herencia. Es demandante Isabel Bibby Vda. de Padilla, y tercerista Concepcion Paterno Vda. de Padilla, siendo demandado Bibiano L. Meer, como Administrador de Rentas Internas. Las partes presentaron al Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila, ante al cual se sometio el asunto, antes de la vista del mismo, el siguiente convenio de hechos: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Come now the parties in the above entitled case through their respective counsel and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit the following stipulation of facts: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I. That on February 14, 1934, Dr. Narciso A. Padilla died in the City of Manila. \"II. That on March 12, 1934, two (2) documents, each purporting to be the last will and testament of the said deceased, were presented for probate in the Court of First Instance of Manila under cases Nos. 56058 and 56063. \"III. That the said two cases were jointly heard and on April 12, 1934, Doña Concepcion Vda. de Padilla took her oath of office as special administratrix of the estate of the deceased. \"IV.

That on January 8, 1936, the Committee on Claims and Appraisals submitted its final report to the court, appraising the value of the estate of the deceased at P261,713. \"VI. That on August 23, 1937, the defendant Collector of Internal Revenue filed an inheritance tax return for the estate of the deceased based in the forementioned report of the Committee on Claims and Appraisals, dated January 8, 1936, and several previous inventories filed in the record of this case, copies of which documents were furnished the representative of the Collector of Internal Revenue, Mr. N.S.

Of this amount, the sum of P1,654.15 constitutes the accrued interest collected for the period from September 13, 1935, the supposed beginning of the delinquency, up to August 27, 1937. A certified copy of said assessment notice is hereto attached a Appendix ’B’. \"VIII.

Samanillo Building \"PATROCINIO J. DAYRIT \"Attorney for Intervenor \"401 Cu Unjieng Building\" Dicho Tribunal, en vista de este convenio de hechos, fallo el litigio, ordenando al demandado Administrador de Rentas Internas, Bibiano L. Meer, a devolver a la demandante la suma de P1,674.15, reclamada en la demanda, la cual suma representa el recargo sobre impuesto de herencia pagado. Segun el convenio de hechos, la relacion de las propiedades sujetas al impuesto no fue presentada por la demandante sino por el demandado; que la demandante, dentro del periodo del plazo señalado por la ley, desde que recibio el aviso del demandado, pago el impuesto requerido y, bajo protesta, el recargo. La cuestion, por tanto, que debe resolverse es la de si, no habiendo la demandante sometida la mencionada relacion de bienes sujetos al impuesto, ha incurrido o no en mora. Nada hay en al articulo 1544 del Codigo Administrativo Revisado — el cual regula el caso sometido ante Nos-que declara en mora al que dejara de someter, en un caso como este, dentro del periodo de 18 meses, la relacion arriba mencionada y pagar el impuesto correspondiente dentro del plazo. Dicho articulo dispone, por el contrario que, en casos de omision, por parte de los interesados, de presentar la repetida relacion de bienes sujetos al impuesto, debera (shall dice la ley) presentarla el Administrador de Rentas Internas y pagarse, dentro de veinte (20) dias a contar desde el requerimiento hecho al afecto, el impuesto. La demandante cumplio con este mandato legal, pagando el impuesto dentro del mencionado plazo. La alegacion del demandado de que, bajo el articulo 25 de los Reglamentos No. 42, segun ha sido enmendado por el articulo 5 de los Reglamentos No. 63, promulgados por el Departamento de Haciendo, era deber de la demandante el presentar la relacion de bienes, exigida por la ley, dentro de 18 meses, no concuerda con la letra y el espiritu del articulo 1544 del Codigo Administrativo Revisado. En el presento caso, segun se desprende del convenio de hechos, no se ha sometido al Juzgado ningun proyecto de particion de los bienes en el expediente de la testamentaria del finado Narciso Padilla, en que es una de las administradoras la demandante y apelada. La decision, ordenando la legalizacion del testamento de dicho finado, fue elevada, en apelacion a este alto Tribunal, y no fue decidida sino el 30 de junio de 1938. Es evidente, por tanto, que el deber de presentar, en el caso de autos, le relacion de los bienes sujetos al impuesto, era del Administrador de Rentas Internas, y no la demandante. En vista de los hechos y consideraciones arriba expuestos, fallamos que procede confirmar, como por la presente confirmamos, en todas sus partes, le sentencia objeto de recurso, modificando solamente aquella parte en que se condenaba al demandado a pagar las costas. Virtualmente, la parte aqui demandada es el Gobierno; siendo esto el caso, entendemos que no procede condenar en costas al demandado, que la representa. Asi se ordena. Avanceña, Pres. Imperial, Diaz, y Laurel, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El 1. ï¿½ de octubre de 1936 Benigno Titong obtuvo del Banco Nacional Filipino un prestamo por la cantidad de P450, que vencio el 28 de enero de 1937, garantizado con una fianza prestada por Felipe Zaragoza y Ventura Cabug. En la misma fecha del vencimiento de este prestamo, sin que se haya pagado, Benigno Titong obtuvo del mismo Banco Nacional Filipino otro prestamo por la cantidad de P450 grarantizado con la hipoteca del terreno en cuestion, que se describe en la solictud. No habiendos pagado el primer prestamo a su vencimiento , el Banco Nacional Filipino promovio ante el Juzgado de Paz del municipio de Masbate, Provincia de Masbate, la accion correspondiente pra su cobro. Habiendose dictado sentencia favorable, y en virtud de la ejucucion de esta sentencia, la finca en cuestion fue vendida en publica subasta y adjudicada a Venancio Nera, que fue el mejor postor, el 21 de mayo de 1938. habiendo transcurrido parte del duedor, sin que se hiciera uso de el, el sheriff provincial expidio en favor de Venancio Nera el certificado de venta definitiva. Por otra parte, habiendo vencido tambien el segundo prestamo, sin que fuera pagado por la deudor Benigno Titong, y habiendo sido dada la finca en cuestion en hipoteca para asegurar el pago de este prestamo, el Banco Nacional Filipino, de acuerdo con la Ley No. 3135, pidio su venta, y fue adjudicada al mismo Banco Nacional Filipino, como mejor postor, el 15 de mayo de 1939. En esta venta Venancio Nera, que ya habia comprado la misma finca en la ejecucion del primer prestamo, presento terceria, pero, por haber prestado el Banco la fianza correspondiente, la venta se Ilevo a cabo. En virtud de esta venta de la finca en cuestion hecha al Banco Nacional Filipino, este, invocando la seccion 7 de la Ley No. 3135, tal como esta enmendada por la seccion 2 de la Ley No. 4118 de la Legislatura Filipina, pidio del Juzgado de Primera Instancia que se le diera posesion de la misma, mediante la fianza correspondiente. Habiendose opuesto a esta peticion Venancio Nera, que tenia la posesion de la finca en virtud de la venta hecha a el relacion con el primer prestamo, el Juzgado estimo esta oposicion y denego la posesion solicitada por el Banco Nacional. El Banco National Filipino presenta ahora esta solicitud original de certiorari contra el Honorable Juez de Primera Instancia de Masbate, que denego su peticion de posesion, y contra el interesado Venancio Nera. La unica cuestion que suscita este remedio es si el Juzgado de Primera Instancia obro sin jurisdiccion, o, con abuso de su discrecion, al dictar la resolucion recurrida. Desde luego la misma actitud del Banco, al solicitar del Juzgado de Primera Instancia que se le diera posesion de la finca por el comprada, implica reconocimiento de la jurisdiccion del Juzgado para actuar en la materia. La funcion del Juzgado en el ejercicio de esta jurisdiccion no es meramente ministerial. El Juzgado puede conceder o denegar la peticion, segun los casos. No hay nada en la Ley No. 3135 que indique que esta funcion del Juzgado es ministerial. Al contrario, se infiere de sus otras disposiciones que no tiene este caracter, toda vez que, aun despues de concedida, puede dejarla sin efecto. Siendo esto asi, lo unico que tenemos que considerar en este caso es si el Juzgado obro con abuso de su discrecion, y en este respecto, hallamos que tampoco procede el remedio solicitado. Debe notarse que la posesion de la finca no esta en el deudor del Banco, sino en Venancio Nera, que es un tercero que la ha adquirido aparentemente de una manera legal. No carece de importancia tener en cuenta que Venancio Nera compro esta finca en publica subasta en virtud de una ejecucion de sentencia dictada en favor del Banco mismo. Debe presumirse que el Banco conocia los tramites de la causa que promovio contra su deudor, Benigno Titong, en relacion con el primer prestamo y debe presumirse, por tanto, que tenia conocimiento de la venta de esta finca en favor de Venancio Nera para satisfacer la sentencia obtenida por el mismo Banco en su favor. Estas circunstancias consideramos indicativas de que, por lo menos, el Juzgado no obro con abuso de discrecion al dictar la sentencia objeto de este recurso. Por estas consideraciones, se deniega la solicitud de certiorari , con las costas al solicitante. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes. Se deniega la solicitud.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Francisco Jarque, en vida, estaba dedicado a la compra y venta, entre otros productos locales, de copra y abaca. Sus efectos los enviaba a ciertas personas, a quienes llama agentes, para su venta. El Gobierno, por medio del Administrador, de Rentas Internas, cobro de Francisco Jarque el importe del impuesto correspondiente por los articulos asi transferidos a sus supuestos agentes, por sostener que estas transferencias eran, en realidad, ventas. El Juzgado, aceptando esta teoria del Gobierno, condeno a Jose Corominas, en representacion de la insolvencia de Francisco Jarque, al pago del importe de estos impuestos. Jose Corominas apelo de esta decision. Despues de considerar los hechos aceptados por el Juzgado, hallamos que, en efecto, las transferencias que Francisco Jarque hacia de sus articulos a sus supuestos agentes eran ventas. No se hacia inventario de los articulos vendidos en las diferentas agencias. No se hacia constar en los libros el precio de la venta o de los efectos que no llegaban a venderse dentro del año. Estos supuestos agentes eran responsables de los efectos que recibian al precio expresado en el conocimiento de embarque. Los precios incluyen, ademas, cierta otra cantidad que representaba la ganancia que Jarque obtenia. Los agentes vendia estos articulos al precio que ellos mismos fijaban, sin dar cuenta a Jarque de estos precios, y, ya se vendan no se vendan estos efectos, ellos siempre se cargaban contra dichos supuestos agentes. De esta manera Jarque no sufria perdida alguna, en caso de que los efectos se vendieran a precios bajos, ni obtenia ganancia, en caso de que se vendieran a precios mas altos. Se infiere de estas relaciones entre Jarque y sus supuestos agentes que estos no eran, en el concepto legal, agentes o comisionistas, y que las transferencias que Jarque hacia de sus efectos a ellos eran, en realidad, ventas. Se confirmas la sentencia apelada, con las costas al apelante. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandante W. R. Giberson es un comerciante de Cebu, que negocia en libros, magazines, articulos de escritorio y otros semejantes. Libby, McNeill & Libby Co., Inc., es una corporacion dedicada a la venta de productos alimenticios con oficina establecida en Manila. El julio de 1928 esta Corporacion entro en relaciones con el demandante enviandole sus productos. El demandante los recibia y depositaba en su bodega. La Corporacion tenia empleado en Cebu a un vendedor de estos productos que recibia el demandante. Este vendedor estaba pagado por la Corporacion con un sueldo de P200 al mes y recibia instrucciones de ella para la venta de sus productos al precio que ella fijaba. Este vendedor era el que expedia las ordenes por las ventas y con arreglo a ellas el demandante enviaba los productos. El precio de los articulos se hacia pagadero a la Corporacion y el demandante no tenia autorizacion para cobrar y hacer efectivos los cheques que se expedian por su importe. El vendedor era el que tenia la autoridad de hacerlos efectivos y expedir los correspondientes recibos. El demandante, por su parte, percibia de la Corporacion la cantidad de P250 al mes por estos servicios. El Administrador de Rentas Internas considero la intervencion del demandante en estas ventas de los productos de la Corporacion como una comision y cobro del mismo en este concepto la cantidad de P2,589.10 como impuesto. La cuestion suscitada en esta causa se reduce a si el demandante, en sus relaciones con la Corporacion Libby, McNeill & Libby Co., Inc., en la venta de los productos de esta, obraba como comisionista. El demandante, alegando que no obro como comisionista, pide que se lo devuelva la cantidad de P2,589.10 que fue cobrada de el por el Administrador de Rentas Internas erroneamente. El Juzgado ordeno al Administrador de Rentas Internas devuelva al demandante la cantidad reclamada. Se infiere de los hechos expuestos que el demandante no intervenia en la venta de los articulos de Libby, McNeill & Libby Co., Inc., pues, quien estaba encargado de esta transaccion era el vendedor nombrado por la Corporacion. La unica intervencion que el demandante tenia en relacion con estos articulos era recibirlos y depositarlos para ser entregados a los compradores a quienes el vendedor los vendia. Es verdad que en ciertas ocasiones el mismo demandante hacia la venta de estos articulos cuando estaba ausente el vendedor, pero, en esto el actuaba, no por comision de la Corporacion, sino en sustitucion del vendedor ausente, y esto, que solo ocurria accidentalmente, no cambia el caracter de las relaciones entre el demandante y Libby. Por estas consideraciones, se confirma la sentencia apelada sin especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library En este expediente el Juzgado, el 18 de marzo de 1938, ordeno la comparecencia de los acreedores a fin de pagar sus creditos con la cantidad que se obtuvo de la venta de uno de los bienes de este intestado. Entre los creditos cuyo pago ordeno el Juzgado fueron los siguientes: 1. ï¿½, P320 en favor del Gobierno como impuesto de herencia; 2. ï¿½ P305.44, importe de la sentencia dictada en favor del municipio de Candelaria, Tayabas; y 3. ï¿½ los derechos por servicios profesionales prestados por Gabriel N. Trinidad, como abogado de la administracion. De esta resolucion la administradora Amada Dacanay apelo, alegando que el Juzgado erro al no declarar preferente su reclamacion por sus servicios prestados como tal administradora y por las cantidades acumuladas y no pagadas que corresponden a su mantenimiento En cuanto a la cantidad de P320, que se debe al Gobierno por impuesto de herencia, se alega que su pago fue prematuro por no haberse hecho aun la liquidacion y reparticion en este expediente. Este fundamento es claramente erroneo. La seccion 1544 del Codigo Administrativo, tal como esta enmendado por la Ley 3606, prove que cuando es promovido el intestado o la testamentaria de un difunto antes de expirar seis meses despues de la muerte y no se ha hecho aun la reparticion despues de 18 meses de haberse promovido, como en este caso, el Administrador de Rentas Internas determinara el importe del impuesto con arreglo a las mejores pruebas que puedan obtenerse y demandara su pago del admirnistrador. No es, por tanto, exacto que el impuesto de herencia no puede cobrarse sino despues de hecha la particion de los bienes del finado entre los interesados. La cantidad de P305.44, importe de la sentencia dictada en favor del Gobierno contra este intestado, es indiscutiblemente un credito legal. Y en cuanto a los derechos profesionales del abogado de la administraccion, que se consideran como gastos de administracion, su pago es igualmente legal. En realidad, no se discute la legalidad de estos creditos. Lo que la apelante sostiene es que su reclamacion por el importe de sus servicios y el de su manutencion constituyen una reclamacion preferente. Pero, resulta que su reclamacion en estos conceptos no ha sido aprobada por el juzgado y no procede todavia su pago. Por otra parte, no consta que, despues de hechos estos pagos aprobados por el Juzgado, el intestado careceria ya de fondos para pagar el credito de la administradora en el caso de que fuera aprobado debidamente en su tiempo. Por estas consideraciones, se confirma la sentencia apelada, con las costas a la apelante. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

Hahn, es arrendatario, y Henry Dusdieker y Antonio Aboody Perez, son sub-arrendatarios, del terreno descrito en la solicitud y fueron demandados en el juzgado de pa por el recurrido J. M. Tuazon & Co., Inc., para que desalojen el terreno, paguen la renta no pagada a razon de P500 al mes desde el 19 de julio de 1938 y P2,000 como indennizacion de daños y perjuicios. Los solicitantes contestaon a la demanda negando el dominio de la corporacion demandada y alegando derecho de opcion de compra, qul enunciaron ejercer El juzgado de paz accedio a la denanda en su decision de 10 de abril de 1939, condenando a todos los demandados a desalojar ]a finca y, especialmelte, a D. H. Hahn a pagar las rentas y los daños reclamalos. Se apelo de esta decision ante el Juzgado de Primea Instancia en el cual las partes reprodujeron sus alegaciones. El 23 de mayo de 1939, la corporacion recurrida pidiola ejecucion de la sentencia del juzgado de paz por no haber los apelantes protado la fianza requerida en el articulo 88 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil, pero, habiendose posteriormente prestalo esta fianza, la solicitud de ejecucion de la sentencia fue denegada. Mas tarde, por no laberse hecho el deposito de las rentas que fueron venciendo, la corporacion recurrida pidio otra vez el 26 de juniade 1939 la ejecucion de la sentencia por este fundamento. El Juzgado accedio a esta peticion y ordeno la ejecucion de la sentencia en cuanto a Hahn, que era el unico a quien la sentencia del juzgado de paz obligo a pagar los daños y las rentas reclamadas. Se ha presentado esta solicitud original de certiorari contra J. M. Tuason & Co, Inc., el Juez de Primera Instancia que dicto las resoluciores mencionadas y el sheriff provincial que ha recibido las ordenes para ejecutar dichas resoluciones. Se alega que el Juzgado de Primera Instancia carecia de jurisdiccion para dictar dichas resoluciones. Se pretende, en primer lugar, que el Juzgado de Paz que dicto la sentencia en esta causa no tenia jurisdiccion para dictarla por razon de la cuantia de los daños y las rentas reclamadas. Esta pretension es infundada. Esta Corte tiene declarado que la jurisdiccion del juzgado de paz sobre detentacion de inmueble no queda afectada por la cuantia de los daños y perjuicios y rentas que al mismo tiempo se reclaman en la accion (Miguel Boga Tan Chiao Boc y otro contra Gregorio Sajo Vecina, 11 Jur. Fil., 422). Se alega tambien que el Juzgado de Primera Instancia obro sin jurisdiccion al ordenar la ejecucion de la sentencia del juzgado de paz, no obstante haberse prestado fianza para su suspension. Es verdad que la fianza a este efecto prestada suspendio la ejecucion de la sentencia, como asi se acordo por el Juzgado, pero, la ejecucion ordenada ultimamente lo fue por no haberse hecho de deposito de las rentas vencidas, que es otro fundamento por el cual puede ejecutarse la sentencia dictada por el juzgado de paz durante la apelacion (articulo 88 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil). Mas, la ejecucion de la sentencia por este fundamento debe entenderse, desde luego, limitada a D. H. Hahn, que es el unico a quien el Juzgado obligo a pagar estos daños y perjuicios y rentas del terreno. No puede extenderse a los otros dos solicitantes Henry Dusdieker y Antonio Aboody Perez porque la sentencia, en virtud de la fianza prestada, fue suspendida en cuanto a ellos y porque, siendo el fundamento de la ejecucion ordenada la falta del deposito de las rentas, estos dos solicitantes no han sido condenados a pagar estas rentas. Debe entenderse, sin embargo, que, en cuanto a la possession de la finca arrendada, la ejecucion de la sentencia contra D. H. Hahn se llevara a cabo cualquiera que sea su efecto en relacion con los otros dos solicitantes, toda vez que el derecho de estos en este respecto esta subordinado al de D. H. Hahn. Por lo demas, el haberse cuestionado en la contestacion de los demandados el dominio de la recurrida sobre la finca arrendada no afecta a la jurisdiccion del juzgado de paz, no estando la cuestion de dominio necesariamente envuelta en la accion. Por estas consideraciones, y entendiendose esta decision en los terminos expuestos, se deniega la solicitud, sin especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas. Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Hacia el ano 1939 los recurridos Manuel I. Felizardo, Andres Borromeo y Florentino Reyes eran los miembros de la Junta Examinadora de Ingenieria Mecanica, organizada de acuerdo con la Ley No. 294, como esta enmendada por la No. 481 del Commonwealth. El 15 de agosto de aquel año, los Sres. Alberto Muscat, Norberto Capay y otros presentaron una peticion ante esta Junta de Examinadores para ser registrados como ingenieros mecanicos profesiona les sin necesidad de examen, alegando que ellos poseen, para gozar de este beneficio, las cualificaciones necesarias que se requieren en la seccion 44 (a) de dicha Ley. El 17 de octubre de 1939, la Junta denego esta peticion, fundandose en que los solicitantes carecen de las alegadas calificaciones El 7 de noviembre de 1939, la Junta sometio esta resolucion al Honorable M. Jesus Cuenco, Secretario de obras Publicas y Comunicaciones. El 17 de noviembre del mismo ano, el Honorable M. Jesus Cuenco envio a la Junta una comunicacion, instruyendola que reconsidere su decision y expida los certificados de registro .solicitados por Muscat, Capay y otros. Esta accion del Honorable M. Jesus Cuenco fue el resultado de una conferencia que tuvo con el Secretario de Justicia, que es el consejero legal de la Junta. El 24 de noviembre, la Junta adopto una resolucion, en la cual, expresando que, no obstante de que, en su opinion, los solicitantes no reunen las condiciones requeridas por la ley para ser registrados como ingenieros mecanicos profesionales sin previo examen, sin embargo, en deferencia a la opinion del Honorable Secretario de Justicia, resolvia someter los nombres de Alberto Muscat y Norberto Capay al Honorable Secretario de obras Publicas para la expedicion del certificado de registro solicitado por ellos. Por los hechos expuestos la Philippine Association of Mechanical and Electrical Engineers presento esta solicitud de certiorari ante este Tribunal Supremo contra el Honorable M. Jesus Cuenco, Secretario de obras Publicas y Comunicaciones, y la Junta de Examinadores para ingenieros mecanicos, compuesta por los Sres. Manuel I. Felizardo, Andres Borromeo y Florentino Reyes, alegando que los recurridos obraron sin jurisdiccion y con abuso de discrecion al someter los nombres de Muscat y Capay para ser registrados como ingenieros mecanicos profesionales sin previo examen, y pide que se declare por este Tribunal que los recurridos obraron sin jurisdiccion y con abuso de discrecion. Pendiente este procedimiento de certiorari , los Sres. Manuel I. Felizardo y Florentino Reyes dejaron de ser miembros de la Junta y en su lugar fueron nombrados Clemente Hidalgo y Felipe A. Roman. El 27 de julio de 1940, la Junta compuesta por estos nuevos miembros y Andres Borromeo de la anterior, resolvio conformarse con la interpretacion de la ley dada por el Secretario de Justicia y por el Secretario de obras Publicas y Comunicaciones. La alegacion de que los recurridos obraron con abuso de discrecion y en exceso de .su jurisdiccion se funda en que, no obstante haber expresado que en su opinion personal los solicitantes carecen de las calificaciones requeridas para ser registrados como ingenieros mecanicos profesionales sin examen, resolvieron, sin embargo, someter sus nombres para ser registrados solo por deferencia a la opinion del Secretario de Justicia. No siendo ahora los recurridos Manuel I. Felizardo y Florentino Reyes miembros de la Junta, la accion ejercitada ha perdido su objeto en cuanto a ellos. Por otra parte, habiendose los actuales miembros de la Junta adoptado incondicionalmente la opinion del Secretario de Justicia, en cuanto a ellos, no existe el fundamento del presente recurso. Por estas consideraciones, se sobresee el recurso, sin especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas. Asi se ordena. Diaz, Laurel, Moran, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "AVANCEÑA, Pres p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library La demandante, entre el enero de 1933 y abril de 1934, ha venido importando desde China a este Puerto huevos contenidos en cestos y cajas de madera. El demandado Administrador Insular de Aduanas ha cobrado por estos huevos los impuestos correspondientes, teniendo en cuenta su peso bruto, es decir, incluyendo el de los recipientes que los contenian. La demandante ha pagado estos derechos o impuestos con protesta y, de hecho, la presento en debido tiempo. Esta accion se ejercita por la demandante contra el demandado para recobrar los derechos por ella pagados en relacion con el peso de los recipientes. El Juzgado absolvio de la demanda al demandado y de esta decision apelo la demandante. Es un hecho que la demandante, antes de recibir los huevos, no exigio que el demandado pesara separadamente los huevos y los recipientes. Este Tribunal Supremo, en la causa de Go Ho Lim v. The Insular Collector of Customs, R. G. No. 41706, ha declarado que cuando la demandante deja de pedir del Administrador de Aduanas que se pesaran huevos independientemente de sus recipientes y no presenta su protesta antes de recibir los huevos, renuncia a su derecho al reembolso de la cantidad que hubiese pagado por derechos que incluyen el peso de los recipientes. Esta decision es perfectamente aplicable al presente caso. Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas a la apelante. Asi se ordena. Diaz, Laurel, Moran, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

En consideracion al riesgo que corrieron estas propiedades hipotecadas y para hacer buena la promesa a sus propietarios de recompensarles de algun modo por este riesgo, la demandada, el 7 de junio de 1929, acordo expedir bonos o certificados de deuda en favor de estos propietarios en la cantidad proporcional al valor de sus propiedades hipotecadas. Se preparo, con aprobacion del demandante, el formulario de estos certificados los cuales, expresan que su importe es pagadero cuando la Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., quede libre de deudas, tenga dinero suficiente disponible y su junta directiva ordene dicho pago, el cual estara sujeto a ciertas condiciones. Entre estas condiciones, en lo que se refiere a loa meritos de esta causa. una es que si el beneficiado es o resultare ser deudor de la Central par cualquier concepto que fuere, su importe, o, la parte del mismo que fuere necesario para pagar dicha deuda, sera acreditado a la cuenta del mismo, cuando la Junta Directiva acuerde el pago de dicho certificado; y que si el beneficiado no sea ni resulte ser en deber a la Central, pero si al demandante Banco Nacional Filipino, el importe del certificado sera entregado a este cuando la Junta Directiva acuerde su pago. La Central demandada expidio varios certificados de deuda en favor de Jose Benares, en la cantidad total de P132,489.81, habiendo sido el ultimo el 8 de octubre de 1935. En esta fecha Don lose Benares debia a la Central la cantidad de P86,049.84, y al Banco demandante la de P634,463.27. Posteriormente, Jose Benares obtuvo de la Central demandaaa un prestamo por la cantidad de P5,000 Cuando la Central demandada pago et importe total de los certificados (P135,489.81) deduio de esta cantidad, no solo los P86,049.84 que Benares la debia al expederse los certificados, sino tambien los P5,000 que le dio en prestamo posteriormente. El Banco demandante se opone al pago a Benares por la Central demandada de esta cantidad de P5,000. Toda la cuestion que se suscita en esta causa esta en la interpretacion del certificado de deuda expedido por la Central demandada a favor de Benares, a saber, si deben imputarse al importe de estos certificados las deudas que Benares tuviera en la fecha de la expedicion del certificado, o, en la fecha del pago de su importe. El demandado arguye que es lo primero y la demandada sostiene que es lo segundo. El Juzgado acepto la teoria de la demandada y la absolvio de la presente accion. Los terminos del certificado, en nuestra opinion, son claros en el sentido aceptado por el Juzgado. La cantidad que, segun el certificado, debe deducirse de su importe es la cantidad de que Benares sea o resultare ser deudor de la Central. Literalmente, el certificado se refiere a la deuda que Benares tuviera en la fecha de la expedicion y la que pudiera contraer despues. Esto aparece mas claro si se tiene en cuenta que el certificado expresa que esta deduccion se haga cuando la Junta Directiva acuerde su pago. Se ve claramente en los terminos de este certificado que las deudas de Benares a la demandada, que deben deducirse de su importe, son, no solamente las que tenian en la fecha de su expedicion, sino tambien las que hubiera llegado a contraer hasta la fecha de su pago. Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas al apelante. Asi se ordena. Diaz, Laurel, Moran, y Horrilleno, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "HORRILLENO, Pres. p: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Lim Bonfing y Hnos., Inc., demandante en este asunto, apelo contra el auto del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Cebu, dictado el 30 de marzo de 1940, en el que se ordenaba e1 levantamiento de la orden de embargo preventivo, expedida en el asunto, por la razon de que el juramento del gerente de la corporacioon demandante sobre los hechos alegados en la demanda, no indicaba conocimiento personal de tales hechos. La parte del juramento, pertinente al caso, dice: \"That the statements contained in the foregoing complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" cralaw virtua1aw library El demandado-apelado fundandose en el mismo motivo, y alegando, ademas, que hubo novacion de contrato por el convenio de hechos sometido al Juzgado por las partes, sostiene la accion de este al ordenar la disolucion del embargo. Los hechos que dieron lugar a la presentacion de la demanda son. brevemente, los siguientes: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library El demandado, con anterioridad al año 1932, recibio de la demandante, en diferentes fechas, varias cantidades de dinero como pago adelantado del azucar que convino en entregar y vender a dicha demandante. No habiendo entreFado el demandado todo el azucar que habia prometido y convenido entregar a la demandante, efectuose una liquidacion de cuentas entre ambos el 16 de febrero de 1932, en la Ciudad de Cebu. El demandado reconocio en-un documento, como resultado de la liquidacion de cuentas, una deuda a la demandante que ascendia a P9,150, obligandose, ademas, a pagar intereses sobre dicha suma, a razon de 12 por ciento al año, hasta que se pagara totalmente, debiendo hacerse el pago en tres plazos, siendo el ultimo el año 1934. No habiendo pagado el demandado ninguno de los plazos convenidos, no obstante los repetidos requerimientos de la demandante, esta presento demanda contra aquel, en la que entre otras cosas, se alegaba que el demandado estaba para vender y disponer de sus propiedades con el objeto de defraudar a sus acreedores, particularmente a la demandante; por lo que esta pidio la expedicion de una orden de embargo preventivo, para cuyo efecto Lim Yok Su, el gerente de la corporacion, Lim Bonfing y Hnos., Inc., presento el siguiente juramento: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"I, Lim Yok Su, being duly sworn, depose and state: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"That I am the general manager of Lim Bonfing y Hnos. Inc.; that there is due and payable to the plaintiff the principal amount and interests stated in the complaint filed herein; \"That this case is one of those mentioned in sec. 424 of Act 190; and that the defendant is about to dispose of his proporties for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and other creditors; That plaintiff has no sufficient security for the claim sought to be enforced by this action, and as far as the plaintiff is informed, the defendant has no legal set off or counterclaim against the plaintiff; and that there is a sufficient cause of action against the defendant; \"That the statements contained in the foregoing complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. (Sgd.) \"LIM YOK SU En el juramento arriba transcrito no hallamos nada que apoye la conclusion de que Lim Yok Su no tenia conocimiento personal de los hechos sobre que juraba; por el contrario, en el tercer parrafo del juramento se afirma, positivamente, \"that the defendant is about to dispose of his properties for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and other creditors . . . That the statements contained in the foregoing complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" Notese bien \"to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" No dice \"to the best of my information.\" Entendemos, pues, que, tal como esta redactado el juramento, la conclusion a que llego el Tribunal de origen, de que la declaracion jurada del gerente de la corporacion demandante no indicaba conocimiento personal suyo de los hechos sobre que presto el juramento, es erronea. En cuanto a que el convenio de hechos, sometido por las partes al Juzgado, las cuales pedian que se decidiera la causa, de acuerdo con dicho convenio, es una novacion de la obligacion del demandado, tal proposicion es insostenible. La obligacion contraida por este de pagar el saldo deudor de sus cuentas con la demandante, permanece la misma; no ha cambiado ni un apice. Lo unico que se ha modificado, por convenio de las partes, es el modo como debia pagarse la deuda; no la obligacion misma, o sea la deuda. (Inchausti y Cia. contra Yulo, 34 Jur. Fil., 1027.) Por todo lo cual, procede, en nuestro sentir revocar las ordenes apeladas como por la presente las revocamos, con las costas a cargo del apelado. Avanceña, Pres., Diaz, Laurel, y Moran, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "Esta es una apelacion, mediante certiorari , interpuesta por la demandante contra la sentencia del Tribunal de Apelaciones, promulgada el dia 28 de septiembre de 1939, en la que se confirmaba la del Tribunal a quo que absolvia al demandado de la demanda, en que se reclamaba la devolucion de ciertas cantidades pagadas, bajo protesta por la demandante y apelante, en concepto de impuestos. sta, en su alegato presentado en esta instancia, señala diez errores cometidos, segun ella, por el Tribunal de Apelaciones al fallar el asunto. El segundo error apuntado dice: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"II. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Exhibits 4 and 2- C formed part of the contracts entered into between petitioner and its customers, or that these exhibits could affect petitioner’s liability for tax on these transactions.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Uno de los fundamentos, diriamos mejor, el fundamento principal en que se baso tanto el Tribunal a quo como el de Apelaciones, al decidir el asunto, lo constituye el documento Exhibito 2-C, que es una carta escrita dos años de la fecha de las transacciones que dieron lugar al asunto, y est firmada por el Sr. Pope, un empleado de la apelante. Esta pidio que el Sr. Pope declarase para explicar el contenido del mencionado documento. EI Tribunal a quo, sin embargo, fundado en que el contenido de dicho documento no puede ser modificado mediante prueba oral, no admitio el testimonio del Sr. Pope, de lo cual se excepciono la demandante. La controversia entre las partes versa sobre si los fletes pagados por la apelante en nombre y representacion, segun ella, de sus clientes o compradores, son fletes pagados por la misma en nombre suyo propio y no en el de los compradores. El Exhibito 2-C habla de fletes. Es, por tanto, esencial para la demandante y apelante explicar la verdadera relacion de tales fletes con las transacciones que motivaron el cobro de los impuestos, objeto del asunto. El Tribunal a quo, sin embargo, sosteniendo que el contenido del mencionado exhibito no puede ser alterado mediante pruebas orales, y fundndose en que se est en un caso de un contrato en que ninguna de las partes contratantes puede variar su contenido (por regla general), rechazo el testimonio del Sr. Pope. Entendemos que el documento Exhibito 2-C no establece ninguna relacion contractual entre la demandante y apelante y el que lo suscribe; por tanto, no cabe aplicar la regla de que cuando los trminos de un contrato se han puesto por escrito por las partes contratantes, se presume que tal contrato por escrito contiene todo lo pactado y convenido entre ellas. Por consiguiente, procedia en el caso que nos ocupa la admision de prueba oral sobre el verdadero significado del repetido documento. y no habindosele permitido a la apelante hacerlo, se ha cometido, a nuestro juicio, un error sustancial que debe corregirse. Por consecuencia, sin decidir los mritos del asunto, fallamos que se devuelva el mismo al Tribunal de origen para que re-abra el juicio y permita a la apelante presentar sus pruebas en relacion con el expresado documento, sin perjuicio del derecho del demandado a producir las suyas, si hubiere, relativas al mismo punto; y que, una vez presentadas dichas pruebas y oidas las partes, dicte sentencia de nuevo segun los mritos del asunto. No se hace especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas. Asi se ordena. Avanceña, Pres., Abad Santos, Diaz, y Laurel, MM., estan conformes.\n",

      "On December 26, 1940, respondent Judge Pastor M. Endencia rendered judgment in civil case No. 55934 of the Court of First Instance of Manila in favor of the plaintiff therein, the Philippine Engineering Corporation, and against defendant, Pedro L. Galang. Defendant interposed an appeal and five days after the perfection thereof the Philippine Engineering Corporation filed with the respondent court a petition for a writ of attachment, alleging among others, \"that the defendant (petitioner here) has disposed of his property or is about to do so with intent to defraud his creditors.\" The petition was granted, and the sheriff of Manila levied on five boilers and six parcels of land belonging to the defendant and garnished his deposits with the Philippine Trust Company in the sum of P491.97. Defendant filed a motion for the discharge of the writ alleging that the disposal of his properties was in the regular and legitimate course of his business and was, therefore, not intended to be in fraud of his creditors. The court refused to discharge the writ unless the defendant file a counterbond in the amount of the judgment. The defendant, instead of filing the counterbond, applies now to this court for a writ of certiorari to declare respondent Judge to have acted without jurisdiction in the issuance of the writ of attachment. It is contended that the respondent court had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of attachment after an appeal has been duly perfected from its final judgment. Section 9 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Upon the filing of the notice of appeal and the approval of the appeal bond and the record on appeal, the appeal is deemed perfected and the trial court loses its jurisdiction over the case, except to issue orders for the protection and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve any matter litigated by the appeal, and to approve compromises offered by the parties prior to the transmittal of the record on appeal to the appellate court. The levy in attachment of the properties of the defendant upon the allegation that he is about to dispose of the same to defraud his creditors is one which is intended for the protection and preservation of the rights of the plaintiff and which in no way involves any matter litigated by the defendant’s appeal. And as the respondent court had jurisdiction to issue the writ of attachment, its errors, if any, committed in the appreciation of the probative value of the facts stated in the petition for the writ do not affect its jurisdiction but merely the exercise of such jurisdiction. We need not belabor here the rule that what makes up jurisdiction is the authority to act in a particular case and not the correctness of the action taken thereon. Without such authority, as determined by law, the court cannot act, or if it does, its actuations are null and void; but where the authority exists, all orders and decisions of the court rendered in the exercise thereof and within its limits are valid even if they were erroneous. In such cases, appeal, not certiorari , is the proper remedy. Petition is dismissed, with costs against petitioner. Abad Santos, Diaz, Horrilleno and Ozaeta, JJ. , concur.\n",

      "MORAN, J. p. This is an action for foreclosure of mortgage. The only question raised in this appeal is: Is defendant-appellee bound to pay the stipulated interest only up to the date of maturity as fixed in the promissory note, or up to the date payment is effected? This question is, in our opinion, controlled by the express stipulation of the parties. Paragraph 4 of the mortgage deed recites: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"Que en consideracion a dicha suma aun por pagar de DOS MIL CUATROCIENTOS PESOS (P2,400.00), moneda filipina, que el Sr. Hepti Solas se compromete a pagar al Sr. Jardenil en o antes del dia treintaiuno (31) de marzo de mil novecientos treintaicuatro (1934), con los intereses de dicha suma al tipo de doce por ciento (12%) anual a partir desde esta fecha hasta el dia de su vencimiento, o sea el treintaiuno (31) de marzo de mil novecientos treintaicuatro (1934), por la presente, el Sr. Hepti Solas cede y traspasa, por via de primera hipoteca, a favor del Sr. Jardenil, sus herederos y causahabientes, la parcela de terreno descrita en el parrafo primero (1. ï¿½) de esta escritura.\" cralaw virtua1aw library Defendant-appellee has, therefore, clearly agreed to pay interest only up to the date of maturity, or until March 31, 1934. As the contract is silent as to whether after that date, in the event of non- payment, the debtor would continue to pay interest, we cannot, in law, indulge in any presumption as to such interest; otherwise, we would be imposing upon the debtor an obligation that the parties have not chosen to agree upon. Article 1755 of the Civil Code provides that \"interest shall be due only when it has been expressly stipulated.\" (Italic supplied.) . A writing must be interpreted according to the legal meaning of its language (section 286, Act No. 190, now section 58, Rule 123), and only when the wording of the written instrument appears to be contrary to the evident intention of the parties that such intention must prevail. (Article 1281, Civil Code.) There is nothing in the mortgage deed to show that the terms employed by the parties thereto are at war with their evident intent. On the contrary, the act of the mortgagee of granting to the mortgagor, on the same date of the execution of the deed of mortgage, an extension of one year from the date of maturity within which to make payment, without making any mention of any interest which the mortgagor should pay during the additional period (see Exhibit B attached to the complaint), indicates that the true intention of the parties was that no interest should be paid during the period of grace. What reasons the parties may have therefor, we need not here seek to explore. Neither has either of the parties shown that, by mutual mistake, the deed of mortgage fails to express their true agreement, for if such mistake existed, plaintiff would have undoubtedly adduced evidence to establish it and asked that the deed be reformed accordingly, under the parcel-evidence rule. We hold, therefore, that as the contract is clear and unmistakable and the terms employed therein have not been shown to belie or otherwise fail to express the true intention of the parties, and that the deed has not been assailed on the ground of mutual mistake which would require its reformation, same should be given its full force and effect. When a party sues on a written contract and no attempt is made to show any vice therein, he cannot be allowed to lay any claim more than what its clear stipulations accord. His omission, to which the law attaches a definite meaning as in the instant case, cannot by the courts be arbitrarily supplied by what their own notions of justice or equity may dictate. Plaintiff is, therefore, entitled only to the stipulated interest of 12 per cent on the loan of P2,400 from November 8, 1932 to March 31, 1934. And it being a fact that extrajudicial demands have been made which we may assume to have been so made on the expiration of the year of grace, he shall be entitled to legal interest upon the principal and the accrued interest from April 1, 1935, until full payment. Thus modified, judgment is affirmed, with costs against Appellant . Yulo, C.J. , Ozaeta and Bocobo, JJ. , concur. Separate Opinions PARAS, J. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library Under the facts stated in the decision of the majority, I come to the conclusion that interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum should be paid up to the date of payment of the whole indebtedness is made. Payment of such interest is expressly stipulated. True, it is stated in the mortgage contract that interest was to be paid up to March 31, 1934, but this date was inserted merely because it was the date of maturity. The extension note is silent as regards interest, but its payment is clearly implied from the nature of the transaction which is only a renewal of the old obligation. In my opinion, the ruling of the majority is anomalous and at war with common practice and everyday business usage.\n",

      "The plaintiff-appellee, Fua Cam Lu, obtained in civil case No. 42125 of the Court of First Instance of Manila a judgment sentencing the defendants-appellants, Yap Fauco and Yap Singco, to pay P1,538.04, with legal interest and costs. By virtue of a writ of execution, a certain parcel of land belonging to the appellants, assessed at P3,550 and situated in Donsol, Sorsogon, was levied upon by the provincial sheriff of Sorsogon who, on November 15, 1933, made a notice, duly posted in three conspicuous places in the municipalities of Donsol and Sorsogon and published in the Mamera Press, that said land would be sold at public auction on December 12, 1933. On December 16, 1933, the appellants executed a mortgage in favor of the appellee, wherein it was stipulated that their obligation under the judgment in civil case No. 42125 was reduced to P1,200 which was made payable in four installments of P300 during the period commencing on February 8, 1934, and ending on August 8, 1935; that to secure the payment of the said P1,200, a camarin belonging to the appellants and built on the above-mentioned land, was mortgaged to the appellee; that in case the appellants defaulted in the payment of any of the installments, they would pay ten per cent of the unpaid balance as attorney’s fees, plus the costs of the action to be brought by the appellee by reason of such default, and the further amount of P338, representing the discount conceded to the appellants. As a result of the agreement thus reached by the parties, the sale of the land advertised by the provincial sheriff did not take place. However, pursuant to an alias writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in civil case No. 42125 on March 31, 1934, the provincial sheriff, without publishing a new notice, sold said land at a public auction held on May 28, 1934, to the appellee for P1,923.32. On June 13, 1935, the provincial sheriff executed a final deed in favor of the appellee. On August 29, 1939, the appellee instituted the present action in the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon against the appellants in view of their refusal to recognize appellee’s title and to vacate the land. The appellants relied on the legal defenses that their obligation under the judgment in civil case No. 42125 was novated by the mortgage executed by them in favor of the appellee and that the sheriff’s sale was void for lack of necessary publication. These contentions were overruled by the lower court which rendered judgment declaring the appellee to be the owner of the land and ordering the appellants to deliver the same to him, without special pronouncement as to costs. The appellants seek the reversal of this judgment. We concur in the theory that appellants’ liability under the judgment in civil case No. 42125 had been extinguished by the settlement evidenced by the mortgage executed by them in favor of the appellee on December 16, 1933. Although said mortgage did not expressly cancel the old obligation, this was impliedly novated by reason of incompatibility resulting from the fact that, whereas the judgment was for P1,538.04 payable at one time, did not provide for attorney’s fees, and was not secured, the new obligation is for P1,200 payable in installments, stipulates for attorney’s fees, and is secured by a mortgage. The appellee, however, argues that the later agreement merely extended the time of payment and did not take away his concurrent right to have the judgment executed. This could not have been the purpose for executing the mortgage, because it was therein recited that the appellants promised to pay P1,200 to the appellee as a settlement of the judgment in civil case No. 42125 (en forma de transaccion de la decision . . . en el asunto civil No. 42125). Said judgment cannot be said to have been settled, unless it was extinguished. Moreover, the sheriff’s sale in favor of the appellee is void because no notice thereof was published other than that which appeared in the Mamera Press regarding the sale to be held on December 12, 1933. Lack of new publication is shown by appellee’s own evidence and the issue, though not raised in the pleadings, was thereby tried by implied consent of the parties, emphasized by the appellants in the memorandum filed by them in the lower court, and squarely threshed out in this Court by both the appellants and the appellee. The latter had, besides, admitted that there was no new publication, and so much so that in his brief he merely resorted to the argument that \"section 460 of Act 190 authorized the sheriff to adjourn any sale upon execution to any date agreed upon in writing by the parties . . . and does not require the sheriff to publish anew the public sale which was adjourned.\" The appellee has correctly stated the law but has failed to show that it supports his side, for it is not pretended that there was any written agreement between the parties to adjourn the sale advertised for December 12, 1933, to May 28, 1934. Neither may it be pretended that the sale in favor of the appellee was by virtue of a mere adjournment, it appearing that it was made pursuant to an alias writ of execution. Appellee’s admission has thus destroyed the legal presumption that official duty was regularly performed. The appealed judgment is; therefore, reversed and the defendants- appellants, who are hereby declared to be the owners of the land in question, are absolved from the complaint, with costs against the appellee. So ordered. Yulo, C.J. , Ozaeta and Bocobo, JJ. , concur. Separate Opinions MORAN, J. , dissenting: chanrob1es virtual 1aw library I dissent. By virtue of a judgment for P1,538.04 which appellee obtained against appellants, a writ of execution was issued in pursuance of which a parcel of land belonging to appellants was levied upon and its sale at public auction duly advertised. The sale was, however, suspended as a result of an agreement between the parties, by the terms of which the obligation under the judgment was reduced to P1,200 payable in four installments, and to secure the payment of this amount, the land levied upon with its improvement was mortgaged to appellee with the condition that in the event of appellants’ default in the payment of any installment, they would pay 10 per cent of any unpaid balance as attorney’s fees as well as the difference between the full judgment credit and the reduced amount thus agreed. Appellants failed to comply with the terms of the settlement, whereupon, appellee sought the execution of the judgment, and by virtue of an alias writ of execution, the land was sold at public auction to appellee and a final deed was executed in his favor. Appellants refused, however, to vacate the land and to recognize appellee’s title thereto; hence, the latter instituted the present action for recovery. The majority sustained appellants’ theory upon two grounds: (1) that their liability under the judgment has been extinguished by the agreement and that accordingly there was legally no judgment to execute; and (2) that the auction sale was void not only because the judgment sought to be executed has been extinguished but also because there was no publication thereof as required by law. The first ground is contrary to a doctrine laid down by this Court in a previous case. In Zapanta v. De Rotaeche (21 Phil., 154), plaintiff obtained judgment against defendant for a sum of money. Thereafter, the parties entered into an agreement by virtue of which the obligation under the judgment was to be paid in installments and that, upon default of defendant to comply with the terms of the agreement, plaintiff shall be at liberty to enter suit against him. Defendant defaulted and plaintiff sued out a writ of execution to recover the balance due upon the judgment credit and by virtue thereof defendant’s property was levied upon and sold at public auction. Upon the issue of whether the agreement extinguished the judgment and plaintiff’s right to an execution thereunder, this Court held: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph \"A final judgment is one of the most solemn obligations incurred by parties known to law. The Civil Code, in article 1156, provides the method by which all civil obligations may be extinguished. One of the methods recognized by said code for the extinguishment of obligations is that by novation. (Civil Code, arts. 1156, 1203, 1213.) In order, however, that an obligation shall be extinguished by another obligation (novation) which substitutes it, the law requires that the novation or extinguishment shall be expressly declared or that the old and the new obligations shall be absolutely incompatible. (Civil Code, art. 1204.) In the present case, the contract referred to does not expressly extinguish the obligations existing in said judgment. Upon the contrary, it expressly recognizes the obligation existing between the parties in said judgment and expressly provides a method by which the same shall be extinguished which method is, as is expressly indicated in said contract, by monthly payments. The contract, instead of containing provisions ’absolutely incompatible’ with the obligations of the judgment, expressly ratifies such obligations and contains provisions for satisfying them. The said agreement simply gave the plaintiff a method and more time for the satisfaction of said judgment. It did not extinguish the obligations contained in the judgment, until the terms of said contract had been fully complied with. Had the plaintiff continued to comply with the conditions of said contract, he might have successfully invoked its provisions against the issuance of an execution upon said judgment. The contract and the punctual compliance with its terms only delayed the right of the defendant to an execution upon the judgment. The judgment was not satisfied and the obligations existing thereunder still subsisted until the terms of the agreement had been fully complied with. The plaintiff was bound to perform the conditions mentioned in said contract punctually and fully, in default of which the defendant was remitted to the original rights under his judgment.\" (pp. 159-160.) I see no reason why this decision cannot be made to control in the instant case. Here, as in the Zapanta case, there was an agreement providing for the manner of payment of the obligation under the judgment. In both cases, plaintiff has, by express stipulation, the option to enter an independent suit against defendant should the latter fail to comply with the terms of the settlement. If, in the Zapanta case, plaintiff’s alternative right to execute the judgment has been upheld, I perceive no cogent reason why plaintiff in the instant case would be denied a like option to merely execute the judgment and be compelled, instead, to enter an independent suit on the terms of the settlement. The spirit of the new Rules which frowns upon multiplicity of suits lends additional argument against the majority view. The majority maintains that here there is an implied novation by \"reason of incompatibility resulting from the fact that, whereas the judgment was for P1,538.04 payable at one time, did not provide for attorney’s fees, and was not secured, the new obligation is for P1,200 payable in installments, stipulates for attorney’s fees, and is secured by a mortgage.\" With respect to the amount, it should be noted that, while the obligation under the judgment was reduced to P1,200, there was, however, a stipulation to the effect that the discount would be recoverable in the event of appellants’ default to comply with the terms of the agreement. And as to attorney’s fees and the security by way of mortgage, the stipulation therefor contained in the agreement is of no moment, for it is merely incidental to, and anticipatory of, a suit which appellee may choose to take against appellants. Far, therefore, from extinguishing the obligation under the judgment, the agreement ratifies it and provides merely a new method and more time for the judgment debtor to satisfy it. If the judgment debtor fail to comply with the terms of the agreement, the judgment creditor shall be deemed remitted to his original rights under the judgment which he may choose to execute or enter, instead, a separate suit on the terms of the settlement. This is the ratio decidendi in the Zapanta case; this is the ratio decidendi here. Upon the question of the nullity of the auction sale, the majority appears to have deduced the lack of publication of the necessary notice from isolated parts of the records and from the fact that the published notice regarding the first sale which was suspended, was merely appended to the second sheriff’s sale. It should be noted, however, that appellants have never raised this issue in their pleadings and that the nullity of the sale by them pleaded is made to rest only upon the ground of \"fraud and deceit\" or \"without or with false consideration.\" There having been no issue as to the publication of notice, no evidence thereon has been adduced by both parties whose attention has never been directed to the question of whether the notice appended to the second sale is or is not the true notice published in connection therewith. Under such circumstance, we have only to rely on the presumption of law in favor of the regularity of official action. We cannot safely disregard this presumption of law for the temptation that isolated pieces of the records on appeal may offer in support of one conjecture or another on matters not expressly litigated by the parties. I, therefore, vote for the affirmance of the judgment of the trial court.\n",
